Fury, pure and silver
You grip it tight inside
Like a knife
It glints in your eye

It's why I've arrived, your sex god
Here to take you where
You need to go
To where the dark remembers you

Open up your heart
Like the gates of Hell

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

I am face down on my bed
Still not quite awake yet
Thinking of you
I tuck my hand under my weight

Just tell me what you want to do
Tell me what you want
To burn away
'Cause I could be your stoker

Open up your heart
Like the gates of Hell

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up
