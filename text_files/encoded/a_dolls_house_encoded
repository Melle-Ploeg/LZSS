like one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at an end, Nora. My

find some(659,6)which will busy me and occupy my thoughts. If(257,6)I

kind—(1008,8)But, Christine,(975,6)is so frightfully tiring(712,6)you look tired out

performance was a trifl(766,6)realistic—a(390,8)more so, I mean, than
was strictly compatible(410,6)the limitations of art. But never mind

Capri maiden—my capricious(725,8)(34,12), I should say—on my arm;
took one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on either side, and, as
they say in novels, the beautiful apparition disappeared. An exit ought
