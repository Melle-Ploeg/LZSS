ACT I


_[SCENE.—A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the
entrance-hall, anothe(49,9)lef(48,11)(318,9)study. Between the
doors stands a piano. In the middle(1189,8)left-hand wall is a door,
and beyond it a window. Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs
and a small sofa(135,9)righ(122,11), at the farther end(258,9)
door; and on the same side, nearer the footlights, a stove, two easy
chairs and a rocking-chair; b(318,10) stove and the door,(195,8)
table. Engravings(145,8)walls; a cabinet with china and other small
objects;(281,9)book-case with well-bound books. The floors are
carpeted, and a fire burns(1702,8)stove. It is winter._

_A bell ring(44,9)hall; shortly afterwards(255,9) is heard to
open. Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor
dress and carries a number of parcels; these she lay(366,9)table to
(841,9). She leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is
seen a PORTER who is carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he
give(972,8) MAID who has opene(592,10).]_

NORA.

out her purse.]_ How much?

off her hat and coat. S(32,8) a packet of macaroons from her pocket
and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
listens.]_ Yes, (771,8). _[Still(826,8), she go(573,10)table on the
right.]_

HELMER.

there?(646,8)_[busy opening som(1569,9)parcels]_. Yes, it is!(140,10)Is i(109,12)squirrel bustling about(107,9)Ye(62,12)When did my(58,10)come hom(160,10)Just now. _[P(537,8)bag(453,14)into(453,11) and wipes her
mouth.]_ Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.(378,10)Don’t disturb me. _[A(360,10)ter, he open(1344,11)and looks in(1205,8)oom, pen in hand.]_ Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
(369,8)pendthrift been wasting money again(382,12) but(247,11)this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
This is the first(1312,11)that we have not needed to economise(336,11)Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly(1142,9)Yes(444,11)we may be a wee bit more(58,9) now, mayn’t we? Just a
tiny(50,8)! You are go(1123,8)ave a big salary and earn lots and lots
of money(555,11)Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
salary is du(1398,10)Pooh! we can borrow(1535,9)en(690,11)Nora! _[Goes up(1200,8)and takes her playfully by the ear.]_ The same(620,8)featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today,
and you spent it all in(1792,15)week(1957,8)en on(316,9)’s Eve
a slate fell on my head and killed me, and—(1249,10)putting her hands over his mouth]_. Oh! don’t say such horrid things(697,18)suppose that happened,—what the(889,10)If(795,8)re to happen, I(113,8)uppose I should care whether I owed
money or no(1173,12)Yes, but what about the people who had lent i(1418,10)They? Who would bother(64,10)m?(142,10)not know who they wer(969,12)That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora(1005,10)(1386,8)think about
that. No debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a
home life that depends o(811,8)ing and debt. We two have kept bravely
on the straight road so far, and we will go (44,8)ame way for the
short time longer that there need be any struggl(995,10)_[moving towards the stove]_. As you pleas(1735,10)(1707,11)_[following her]_. Come, come,(1970,12)kylark must not droop her
wings. What is this! Is(2031,20)out of temper? _[Taking out
his purse.]_ Nora, what do you think(1907,8)got her(2044,10)_[turning round quickly]_. Money!(645,12)ere you are. _[Gives her some money.]_ D(121,14)don’(736,9)at

Torvald; that will keep m(1692,8)for a long tim(1874,12)Indeed it must(1840,14)yes,(1654,8). But come here and let me show you(929,8)have
bought. And all so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Iv(812,8)a
sword; and a horse and a trumpet for Bob(35,8)doll and dolly’s
bedstead for Emmy,—they are very plain, but anyway she will soon break
them in pieces. And here are dress-lengths and handkerchiefs(984,9)maids; old Anne ought really to have something better(1944,11)And what is in this parcel(588,12)rying out]_. No, no! you mustn’t see that(2045,9)is evening(1710,11)Very we(502,8)now tell me, you extravagant(1046,8)person, what would
you like for yourself(1762,9)For myself? Oh, I am sure(1764,9)want anyth(158,14)(1728,9)(217,8). Tell m(321,12)reasonable that you would

If you(561,8)want to give(248,13), you might—(10,10)(156,14), out with it!(1599,10)speaking(1331,12)Y(78,8)(107,9)money(1601,10) Only just as
much as you can aff(964,9)then one of these days I will buy(767,10)
with it(1695,11)But, Nora—(1776,8)Oh, do! dear(1744,8);(1761,9)please do! Then(103,8)wrap it up in
beautiful gilt paper(964,8)g it(1958,8)(1469,9) Tree. Wouldn’t that
be fun?(513,11)hat are(796,10)ople called t(30,8)always wasting money(1735,9)Spendthrifts—I know. Let us do(356,8)suggest(2000,9),(362,10)I
shall have time to think(1448,8)am most in want of. That is a very
sensible plan, isn’t it(236,11)_[smiling]_. (1613,10)is—that is to say, if you were(1272,11)save
out of the money I give you(210,11)really(554,14) for
(1116,8). But(104,8)spend it all(456,8)(1941,14)nd any number of
unnecessary things, then I merely have to pay up again(1844,9)Oh bu(396,10)(1042,11)You can’t deny it, my dear(1343,8)Nora. _[Puts his arm round her
waist.]_ It’s a swee(1403,9)s(555,10), but she uses up a deal of
money. One would hardly believe how expensive such(1500,14)s are(1071,9)(137,8)hame to say that. I do(1753,8)save all I can(1743,11)_[laughing]_. That’s very true,—all(1093,8). But(1106,8)’t save

new way of wheedl(1045,9) out of me, and, as soon(1386,8)have got it,
it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it has gone.
Still, one must take you(1497,8)are. It is in the blood; for i(1027,8)

rather—what shall I say—rather uneasy toda(1529,10)Do I(1612,11)You do, really. Look straight at me(1153,9)_[looks at him]_. Well(1453,13)wagging his finger at her]_. Hasn’t Miss Sweet Tooth been breaking
rules in town(189,15)No; what makes you think tha(1590,12)Hasn’t she paid a visit to the confectioner’s(94,11), I assure you(1387,20)Not been nibbling sweet(69,14)certainly not(1174,11)Not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two(148,13)(1917,9)(157,12) really(1542,11)There, there, of course I was only joking(465,11)going(279,8)table(1740,8)right]_. I sh(751,9)think of going
against your wish(812,13)No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word— _[Going up to
her.]_ Keep you(1746,9)Christmas secrets to (1962,8), my darling. They
will all be revealed tonight when th(86,12)Tree is lit, no doubt(1932,9)Did you remember to invite Doctor Rank(872,11)No. But there is no need; as a matter(437,11)he will come to dinner
with us. However, I will ask him when he comes in this morning. I have
ordered some good wine. Nora,(1804,11)think how I am(1144,8) forward
to this even(600,12)So am I! And how the children will enjoy themselves(1786,9)!(1989,10)It is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe appointment, and a
big enough income. It’s delightful to(731,9), isn’t it(1332,9)It’s wonderful(162,11)Do(518,14)last(666,10)? For a full three weeks beforehand you
shut(699,9) up every(342,8) until long after midnight, making
ornaments for(712,19), and all the other fin(1825,8) that
were(1734,8) surprise to us. It was the dullest(209,13)I ever
spent!(310,9) didn’t find it dull(1867,11)_[smiling]_(796,12)was precious(1005,8)result(1993,15)Oh, you shouldn’t tease me about that again. How could I help the cat’s
going in and tearing everything to pieces(1847,11)O(1374,9)you couldn’t, poo(1186,9)girl. You had the best of
intentions to please us all, and that’s the main thing. But it is a
good thing that our hard times are over(1981,9)Yes, it is really(721,10)(1698,11)This time I needn’t sit here and be dull all alone, and you(48,8)
ruin your dear eyes(36,8)r pretty(1477,8)hands—(1679,10)clapping her hands]_. (1796,15)(152,8)any longer, need I! It’s
(938,9)ly lovely to hear you say so! _[Taking his arm.]_ Now I will
tell you how I have been thinking we ought to arrang(850,8)(1972,9).
As soon as(1715,11)is over—_[A bell rings in the hall.]_ There’s the
bell. _[She tidies the room a little(52,12)some one at the door.
What a nuisance(1388,12)f(602,8) caller,(1756,10)I am not at home.

MAID.
_[in(94,9)way]_. A lady to see you, ma’am,—a strang(661,11)Ask her to come in(92,11)to HELMER]_. The doctor cam(215,9)same time, sir(1117,11)Did he go straight into my room?(195,8)Yes(59,8)_[HELMER goes into his room. The MAID ushers in Mrs Linde, who is in
travelling dress, and shuts(392,10)]_

MRS LINDE.
_[in a dejected and timid voice]_. How do you do, Nora(1694,9)_[doubtfully(44,17)—(106,13)You don’t recognise me, I suppose(1987,9)No, I don’t know—yes, to be sure, I seem to—_[Suddenly.]_ Yes!
Christine! Is it(1140,8)you?(146,14)(1175,10)I(1498,9)(62,11)T(1945,10) my no(187,10)ing you! And yet h(1508,10)—_[In
a gentle voice.]_ How you have altered, (174,10)(156,18)I have indeed. In nine, ten long year(1220,10)Is it so long since we met?(358,10) it is. The last eight years have
been a happy time for me, I can (1181,8). And so n(217,12)come into
the town, and have taken this long journey in winter—that was plucky of
you.(692,13)I arrived by steamer this morning(1959,9)To have some fun at(1290,10)-time, o(1871,8). How delightful! We will
have such fun together! But take off your things. You are not cold, I
hope. _[Helps her(1525,8)we will sit down by the stove,(1787,8)cosy.
No, take this armchair; I(67,10)here(1487,8)rocking-chair. _[Takes
(1763,9)(1656,8)you look like your old self again; it was only the
first moment—(240,8)(1551,8) paler(734,11), and perhaps(1590,9)
thinner(480,14)And much, much older, Nora(1469,9)P(73,15) older; very, ver(2023,8); certainly not much. _[Stops
suddenly and speaks seriously.]_ What a thoughtless creature I am,
chattering away like this. My poor, dear(267,12)do forgive me(732,14)What(1390,8)mean(1392,17)gently]_. Poo(86,13)y(388,9)widow(820,14)Yes; it is three years ago now(1813,9)Yes, I knew; I saw it(589,8)papers. I assure you(483,13)I meant
ever so often to write to you(1855,8)time, but I always put it off and
something(32,9)revented(311,17)I quite understand, dea(2030,10)It was very bad of me(1406,11). Poor thing, how you must have
suffered. And he left you nothing(1627,14)No(1742,9)And no children(40,25)Nothing at all, then(1272,14)Not even any sorrow or grief to live upon(1866,9)_[looking incredulously at her]_. But(934,13)is that possible(1842,14)_[smiles sad(822,8)trokes her hair]_. It sometimes happens(961,15)So(688,9)quite alon(1411,8)readfully sad that must be.(1812,8)three
lovely(348,9). You can’t see them just now, for they are out with
their nurse. But(1743,9)must tell me all about it(406,16), no; I want to hear about you(481,11),(597,10)begin. I mustn’t be selfish today; today I must(1399,8)ink
of your affairs. But there is one thing(58,8)(1967,10)Do you know we
have just had a great piece of good luck(730,16), what is it(1177,9)Just fancy, my husband has been made manager of the Bank!(1190,14)our(60,8)? What(135,10)!(1188,13)tremendous! A barrister’s profession is such an uncertain thing,
especially if he won’t undertake unsavoury cases; and naturally Torvald
has never been willing to do that, and (1185,8)agree with him. You may
imagine how pleased we are! He is to take up his work(2022,8)Bank at
the New Year, and then he will have a big salary and lots of
commissions. For the future we can liv(943,8)differently—we can do
just as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy(1598,11)! It will be
splendid to have heaps of money and not nee(36,10)any anxiety, won’t
it(1431,14)Yes, anyhow I think it would be delightful(122,9)what one needs(973,13)not only(36,15), but heaps and(188,15)(2031,14)_[smiling]_. Nora, Nora, haven’t you learned sense yet? In our
schooldays you were(969,9)spendthrift(1552,12)aughing]_. Yes, that is what(725,8) says now. _[Wags her finger at
her.]_ But “(181,10)” is not so silly as you think. We have not been
in a position for me to waste money(54,10)both had to work(2048,14)You too(1167,9)Yes; odds and ends, needlework, crotchet-work, embroidery(823,8)at
kind of thing. _[Dropping her voice.]_ And other things as well. You
know(343,9)left his office when we were married? There was no
prospect of promotion there, and he(278,8)try and earn more than
before. But during the first year he over-worked himself(1927,11).
You see,(111,11)make money every way he could(156,9)worked early
and late; but(44,9)n’t stand it, and fell(127,11) ill(1231,9)
doctors said it was necessary for him to go south(554,18)spent a whole year in Italy, didn’t you(590,12). It was no easy matter to get away, I can(1905,11)It was just
after Ivar was born; but(1619,11)w(459,9)go(112,9)a wonderfully
beautiful journey, and it saved(1686,8)’s life. But it cost a
(1845,10) lot(1359,9)(1414,11)(1182,14)So I should think(1279,9)I(84,8)bout two hundred and fifty pounds. That’s a lot, isn’t (1433,23)d in emergencies like that it is lucky(1558,9)th(1063,8)(152,9) ought to(391,9) that(348,8)it from papa(1418,14)Oh, I see(439,13)(225,8)hat time that he died, wa(206,10)(1145,11)and, just think of it, I(752,10)go and nurse him. I was
expecting little Ivar’s birth every day and I had my poor sick(1472,8)
to look after. My dear, kind father—I never saw him again(523,13)That was the saddest time I have known since our marriag(582,15)I know how fond(1706,10)of him. And then you went off to Italy(1492,14)you see(812,8)money then(1057,9) (1057,8)insisted on our going,
so we started a month later(1948,14)And your husband came back quite well(1650,9)As sound as a bell!(2026,13)But—(158,10)(1705,9)What(20,10)(310,13)thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here just as I did,
(447,8)(119,15)(2043,10)was Doctor Rank,(1435,8)doesn’t come here professionally. He
is our greatest friend, and comes in at least once(708,10). No,
(1819,8)has not had an hour’s illness since(487,11)our children are
strong and healthy and so am I. _[Jumps up and claps her hands.]_
(1283,9)!(1294,10)! it’s good to be alive and happy!—But how horrid
of me; I am talking of nothing but my own affairs. _[Sits on a stool
near her, and rests her arms on her knees.]_ You mustn’t be angry with
me. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love(753,13)? Why
did you marry him(1466,14)My mother was aliv(425,12)was bedridden and helpless,(1220,11)to
provide for my two younger brothers; so I(175,9)think I(1890,9)ified
in refusing his offer(1719,9)No, perhaps(1159,10)quite right. He was rich a(1529,11), then(931,16)believe he was(1047,11) off. But his business was a precarious one;
and, when(1625,10)it all went to pieces(1250,8)re was(597,9)left(1945,9)(1356,8)?—(1994,13)Well,(366,9) turn my hand to anything(1699,8) find—first a small
shop, then(19,8) school,(875,8)on. The last three years have seemed
like one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at an end, Nora. My
poor(633,8)needs me no more, for she is gone;(1564,9)boys do not need
me either; they have got situations and can shift for themselves(603,9)What a relief you must feel if(398,14)No, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No one to live for
anymore. _[Gets up restlessly.]_ (1984,9)why(474,9)not stand the
life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be easier here to
find something which will busy me and occupy my(1756,8)s. If only I
could have the good luck to get some regular work—office work of some
kind—(1941,8)But,(1487,10), that is so frightfully tiring, and you look tired out
now. You had far better go away to some watering-place.(2047,13)_[walking to the window]_. I have no father to give me money for a
journey, Nora(1235,9)_[rising]_. Oh, do(1546,17) me!(141,15)going up to her]_. It is you that must no(75,18), dear.
The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter. No
one to work for, and yet oblige(1911,10)ways on the lookout for
chances. One must live(1171,11)e becomes selfish. When you told me of
the happy turn your fortunes have taken—you will hardly(1538,9)it—I
was delighted not so much on your account as on my own(1694,9)How do you mean?—Oh, I understand. You mean that(1739,9)Torvald could
get you(911,11)to do(656,14)Yes, t(1057,10)at I was thinking of(153,10)e mus(843,12). Just leave it to me; I will broach the subject very
cleverly—I will thin(954,9)thing that will please him very much. It
will make me so(439,8)o be(1030,8) use to you(903,14)How kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me! It is doubly kind
in you, for you know so(1348,8)of the burdens and troubles of life(1969,9)I—? I(65,22)m?(1091,15)smiling]_. My dear! Small household cares and that sort of thing!—You

you, without beating(656,9)e bush—is(355,10) to have an appointment
in the Bank(628,9)What right have you to question me(1406,14)?—You, one of my
husband’s subordinates! But since you ask, you shall know. Yes, Mrs
Linde is(185,23). And(587,8)I who pleaded her cause,

quite understand that your(1353,8)is not very anxious to expose herself
to the chance of rubbing shoulders with me; and I (122,16),
too, whom I have to thank for being turned of(483,10)But I assure you(1987,13)Very likely; but, to come to the point, the time has come when(931,9)

prepared to fight for my small post(1272,12) as if I were fighting
for my life(1882,9)So it seems(1950,14)t(1146,8)only for the sak(243,9)money; indeed, that weighs least
with me(1426,8)matter. T(1334,8)another reason—well, I may as well tell
you. My(1860,9) is this. I daresay you know, like everybody else, that
once, many years ago, I was guilty of an indiscretion(592,11)(906,13)heard something(520,8)kind(1895,13)T(250,9) never came into court; but every way seemed to be closed to
me after that. So I took(1352,8)business(1601,9) know of. I had to do
(176,9); and, honestly,(1006,9)think I’ve been on(740,10)orst. But
now I must cut myself free from all that. My sons are growing up; for
their sake(77,8)try and win back as much respect as I ca(2023,8)

(1295,13)is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud(1803,13)you must believe me(1665,14); i(860,9)in my power to help
you at all(584,16)n it is because you haven’t the will; but(1985,8)means to compel
you(1975,9)You don’t mean(567,10)will tell(1436,11) that I owe you money(1633,13)Hm!—(1576,8)I were to tell him?(1547,9)t would be perfectly infamous of you. _[Sobbing.]_ To think of his
learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an ugly,
clumsy way—that he should learn it from you! And i(187,8)put me in a
horribly disagreeable(1192,9)—(1923,13)n(39,15)(277,9)_[impetuously]_. Well, do it, then!—and it will be(910,9)e for you.
M(430,10)will see for(1651,8) what a blackguard you are, and you
certainly won’t keep your post then(1572,14) asked you if it was only a(274,14)scene at home(620,11)ere

what is still owing, and we shall have nothing more to do with you(1995,17)ming a step nearer(1996,30)Either(938,9) a

that(1885,9)Yes, I think I(37,9)(1670,13)Then I gave you the bond to send by post to(308,12). Is that not
so(116,12)(1555,13)And you naturally did so(1436,8), because five or six days afterwards
you brought me(165,10)(906,10)father’s(567,10). And t(224,10)

lost me all my reputation,(1157,8)hing more or(16,9)worse than what

creatures wrote(1146,8)papers about papa, and how horribly they
slandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if the
Department had not sent you over to inquire into it, and(1570,8)had not
been so kindly disposed and helpful to him(1053,14)little Nora, there is an important difference between(403,12)
and me. Y(423,10)’s reputation as a public official was not above
suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will continue to be so, as long as I
hold my offic(1205,11)ou never can tell what mischief(540,8)en may contrive. We ought to be
so well off, so snug and happy here in our peaceful home, and have no
cares—you and I and the childre(1088,10)! That is why(1672,13)

suppose I am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole staff, to
let people thi(317,10)am a man(727,8)wayed by all sorts of outside
influence? I should very soon feel the consequences of it, I(769,9)
you! And besides(1021,11)one thing that makes it quite(560,22)have(1969,9)(1739,8)Bank(928,13) am(491,8)(1558,13)ever is that(1558,11)His moral failings I might perhaps have overlooked, if necessary(1959,9)Yes, you could—couldn’t you(1669,11)And I hear he is a good worker, too. But I knew him when we were boys.
It was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an incubus in
afterlife. I may as well tell you plainly,(128,9)once on very
intimate terms with one another. But this tactless fellow lays no
restraint on himself when other(714,8)are present. On(636,8)trary, he
thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me, and
every minute it is “I say, Helmer, old fellow!” and(356,8)rt of thing.

But, my dearest Nora—(187,8)Please, Torvald dear—please, please—only an hour more(93,11)Not a single minute, my sweet Nora. You know that was our agreement.
Come along (486,9)room; you are catching cold (1541,9)there. _[He

I thought I couldn’t go away again without having seen you(659,11)_[taking off(1074,8)shawl]_. Yes, take a good look at her. I think she
is worth looking at. Isn’t she charming(405,30)indeed she is(823,11)Doe(74,9)look remarkably pretty? Everyone(276,9)so at t(1936,8).
But she is terribly self-willed, this sweet little person(1620,8)re we

for half(1066,8)(1154,11)Listen to her(803,11)! She had danced her Tarantella, and it had
been a tremendous success, as it deserved—although possibly the
performance was a trifle too realistic—a(390,8)more so, I mean, than
was strictly compatible with the limitations of art. But never mind
about that! The chief thing is, she had made a(231,8)—(23,14)

after that, and spoil the effect? No(802,8)! I took my(858,9) little
Capri maiden—my capricious(725,8)(34,12), I should say—on my arm;
took one quick turn round(1555,11)a curtsey on either side, and, as
they say in novels, the beautiful apparition disappeared. An exit ought
always to b(273,8)iv(1507,12); but that is what I cannot make Nora
understand. Pooh! this room is hot. _[Throws his domino on a chair, and
opens the door of (71,8).]_ Hullo! it’s all dark in here. Oh, of

only send a stolen glance(369,9)direction now(846,9)?—d(170,10)

his opinion about everything, and so I had the same(48,8)s; and if I
differed from him I concealed the fact, because he w(805,10)ave liked
