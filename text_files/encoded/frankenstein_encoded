_To Mrs. Saville, England._


St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.


Y(1026,8)rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
commencement of an enterprise which you have regar(1235,9)such evil
forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidenc(1586,9)success
of my undertaking.

I am already far north of London, and as I walk(83,9)treets of
(388,13)I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this
feeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
fr(2034,8)desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
region of beauty and(394,10)There, Margaret, the sun is for ever
visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put
some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;
and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
wonders and in(349,8)every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
globe. Its productions and features(146,9)ithout example,(483,8)phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those un(155,10)
solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I
may there(245,9) the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may
regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this
voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent(760,9). I
shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part(396,8)world
never before visited,(237,8) tread(615,8)(43,13)imprinted by
the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to
conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to (1870,8) this
laborious voyage(264,10)joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of(845,9)y up his
native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you
cannot contest the inestimable benefit (1630,8)shall confer on all
mankind, to the last generation, by(1032,9)ing a passage near(1542,9)
to those countries, to reach(824,9)(1535,8) so many months are
requisite; or by ascertain(1446,8)secre(673,9)magnet, which, if at
all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.

These reflections have dispelled the agitation wit(225,8)I began my
letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me
to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as
a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual
eye. This(727,12)has been the favourite dream of my early years. I
have read with ardour the accounts(1549,8)va(936,12)s which have
been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean
through the sea(93,8)surround(726,9). You may remember that a
history of(940,8)(169,9)made for(366,8)s(1022,14)composed the
whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,
yet I was passionately fond of reading(1399,8)volumes were my study
day and night, and my familiar(1585,12)m increased(1731,8)gret which
I had felt, as(1361,8), on learning that my father’s dying injunction
had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring lif(966,10)visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets
whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it (943,9). I also
became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;
I imagin(371,8)I also might obtain a nich(787,9)temple where the
names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well
acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.
But just at that time I inherited the fortun(265,8)cousin(658,8)
thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.

Six years have passed since I resolved on my(1708,9)(1579,11). I
can, even now,(1049,12)e hour fro(1484,8)I dedicated myself to this
great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I
accompanied the whale-fishers on several(1455,11)s(2020,8)North Sea;
I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often
worked harder than the common sailors dur(1996,8)(1136,8)devoted my
night(164,9)study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those
branches of physical science(411,12)a naval adventurer might derive
the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hir(488,10)as an
under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquit(549,14)admiration. I
must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second
dignity(1845,8)vessel and entreated me to remain(1523,9)(265,9)
earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.

And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great(1868,8)?
My life might have been(972,8)in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to
every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging
voice would answer(1416,8)affirmative! My courage(1890,8)resolution is
firm; but my hopes fluctuate(1941,9)spirits are often depressed. I am
about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which
will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the(174,8)
of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.

This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly
quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in
my opinion, far more agreeable(1287,8)at of an English stagecoach. The
cold is not excessive, if y(1924,8)rapped in furs—a dress(1638,9)have
already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the
deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise
prevents the blood from(1318,10)freezing in your veins. I have no
ambition to lose my life on the post-road(194,9)St. Petersburgh and
Archangel.

I shall depart(281,8) latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my
inten(529,8)to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by pay(361,8)insurance(142,9)own(1553,8)to engage as many(1859,9)as I think necessary
among those who are accustomed(2038,8)whale-fishing. I do not intend to
sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how
can I(1292,8)this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,
will pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,
or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent(1701,9). Heaven shower down blessings on you,
and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your
love and kindness.

Your affectionate brother,

R. Walton




Letter 2

_To Mrs. Saville, England._
(797,10), 28th March, 17—.


How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!
Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise(1029,9)hired a
vessel and am occupied in collecting m(798,9);(772,10)m(1302,16)engaged appear to be men on(48,8)can depend and are certainly
possessed of dauntless(1999,8).

But(1220,8)one want(1440,13) never yet been able to satisfy, and the
absence of the object(1939,9) I now feel as a most severe evil,(1354,11)friend,(717,9): when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no
one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. (1468,8)commit my thoughts
to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium(1528,9)communication of
feel(1301,8)esire(39,8)pany of a man who could sympathise with me, whose
eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic(1151,9)(1344,9)but I
bitterly feel the want of a friend(1845,11) one near me, gentle yet
courageous, (708,13)a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind(220,8)tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a
friend repair the faults of your poor(1250,8)! I am too ardent in execution
and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me
that I am self-educated:(1950,9)first fourteen years of my life I ran wild
on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.
At that age I became acquainted(951,10)celebrated poets of our own
country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
most important benefits from such a conviction(1796,8)perceived the
necessity of becoming(214,17)more languages than that of my native(220,8). Now I am twenty-eight(1588,8)in reality more illiterate than many
schoolboys of fifteen. I(1109,9)(2002,8)have(1151,8) more and that my
daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters
call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need(1034,9) who would have sense
enough not to despise me as(1150,11)and affection enough for me to
(1446,13)regulate my mind.

Well, these are useless complaints;(1476,10)(1871,8) find no(191,8)on the
wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet
some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these
rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage
and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase
more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an
Englishman, and in the midst of national and(66,11)al prejudices,
unsoftened by(1617,9)ion, retains some of the noblest endowments of
humanity. I first(1263,24)him on board a whale vessel;
finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist
in my(431,11).

The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the
ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This
circum(633,8)added to his well-known integrity and dauntless(659,8), made
me ver(645,11)to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years
spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the
groundwork of my(742,10)(1617,8)cannot overcome an intense distaste to
the usual brutality exercised(581,10)ship:(1497,8)never believed it to b(1718,8)ary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted(481,9)kindliness
of heart(490,9)respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt
myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.(191,8)
of him first in rather a(1567,9) manner, from a lady who owes(164,8)the
happi(693,9)er life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved
a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable
sum in prize-money, the father(1177,8)girl consent(1576,10)match. He saw
his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in
tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreat(1180,10)spare her,
confessing at the same time that s(332,8) another, but(1308,13)poor,
and(1330,8)r(276,8)would never(276,8)(1850,8)union. My generous friend
reassured the suppliant, and o(661,8)informed(1553,9)ame(561,9)over,
instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm(1576,8)s
money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder(1393,8)life; but he
bestowed the whole on his rival, together with(81,11)(1472,8)
(637,11) to purchase stock(524,8)en himself solicited the young
woman’s(696,8)to(411,12)her marriage with(337,10). But the old
man decidedly refused, thinking(130,9)bound in honour to my friend, who,
when he found(851,12)inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned
until he hear(652,8)is former(881,10)was married according to her
inclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is
so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind
of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which
otherwise he would command.

Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or(31,12)an
conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know,(1997,8)am
wavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage
is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The
winter has been dreadfully severe(1351,8)e spring promises well, and it
is(1669,9)ed as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail
sooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me
sufficiently to confide in my prudence and(1843,10)teness whenever the
safety of others is committed to my care.

I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my
undertaking. It is impossible to communicat(93,9)a conception of
the trembling(120,10), half pleasurable and half fearful, with which
I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the
land of mi(931,8)now,” but(455,9)kill no albatross; therefore do not
be alarmed(865,8)(406,8)r if I sh(992,8)e back(284,9)s worn and
woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” Y(1315,8)smile at my allusion, but I
will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my
passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that
production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something
at work in my soul(1207,9)do not understand. I am practically
industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and
labour—but besides this t(174,8)a love for the marvellous, a belief
in(28,17)intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out
of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited
regions I am about to explore.

But to return to dearer(1158,11)ions. Shall I meet you again, after
having traversed immense seas, and returned by(544,10)southern cape of
Africa or America? I dare not expect such success, yet (1260,9)bear to
look(1243,8)reverse(665,8)picture. Continu(459,10)present to write to
me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when
I need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly.
Remember me with affection,(1141,8)you never hear from me again.

Your(54,10)ate brother,
 Robert Walton




Letter 3

_To Mrs. Saville, England._

July 7th, 17—.


My dear Sister,

I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced
on my voyage. This letter will reach(151,8) by a merchantman now on
its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not
see my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good
spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the
floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating(1501,11)s(1129,8)region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We
have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of
summer, and although not so warm as in(640,8), the(1096,10)gales,
which blow us speedily(216,9)those shore(229,8)I so ardently desire
to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth(1709,9)had not
expected.

No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a
letter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are
ac(129,8)which experienced navigators scarcely r(1136,8)to record, and
I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our(965,8)

Adieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as
yours, I will not rashly encounter danger.(36,8)be cool,
(2047,8)ing, and prudent.

But(1637,8) _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I
have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars
themselves being witness(498,8)estimonies of my triumph. Why not
still proceed(119,10)untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the
determined heart and resolved will of man?

My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must
finish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!

R.W.(1712,12)4
(1713,31)August 5(1715,10)So strange an (808,8) has happened to(929,9)I cannot forbear
recording it,(1207,10)it is very probable that you will see me before
these papers can come into your possession.

Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
in the ship on all sides,(1032,10)leaving her the sea-room in which
she floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we
were compassed rou(1992,8)very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,
hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.

About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out
in every direction, vast and irregular plain(1978,8)(412,8)seemed to
have no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and(1315,8)mind began to
grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a(774,9)sight suddenly
attracted our attention and diver(27,8)solicitude from our own
(528,9). We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by
dogs, pass on(2000,11)e north, at the distance of half a mile; a
being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,
sat(585,8)(170,11)guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress
of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the
distant inequalities of the ice.

This appearance exci(457,8)unqualified wonder. We wer(1890,8) believed,
many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition(714,10) denote that
it was not, in reality, so (210,8)as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by
ice, it was impossible to follow his track(1274,8)we had observed with the
greatest(738,10)(1038,13)hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and(1503,8)night(411,8) broke and fre(831,8)hip. We(226,11)lay to until the
morning, fearing to encounter(1244,8)dark those large loose masses which
float about(213,9)e breaking up(585,12) I profited of this time to
rest for a few hours.

In the (176,9)(437,9)as soon as(440,8)light, I went upon deck and
found all the sailors busy on one side(757,8)vessel,(959,11)
talking to someon(1538,9)sea. It was, in fact,(1147,9), like that we
had seen befor(1863,9)had drifted(1169,9)us(1636,8)night on a large
fragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive(850,8)ere was a human(1219,8)ithin it whom(285,13)were persuad(546,9)(481,8)vessel.
He(900,10)as the other(1166,11)(957,10)be, a savage inhabitant of
some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared (486,8)the
master said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
on the open sea.”

On(1648,8)ing me, the(1769,8)r addressed me in English, although with a
foreign accent. “Before I come on board your(647,8)” said he,
“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”

You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question(230,10)
to me from a man on the brink of destruc(2016,9)to whom I should have
(1429,8) that my vessel w(35,9) been a resource(1908,8)e would not
have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I
replied(1557,11)that we were on a voyage of (679,8)y(941,9)the
northern pole.

Up(332,11)this he(696,10)satisfied and consented to(523,14).
Good God! Margaret, if you (1103,9)the man who thus capitulated for
his safety, your surpris(329,8)(365,10)boundless. His limbs were
nearly froze(843,8)is body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and
suffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted
to carry him into the cabin, but(1562,12)he had quitted the fresh
air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the(1616,10)restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forc(28,8)to
swallow a small quantity. A(198,13)showed signs of life we
wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the
kitchen stove. By slow degrees he re(1428,8)and ate a little soup,
which (275,13)wonderfully.

Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often
fear(1070,8)his (593,9)s had deprived him of understanding. When he
had in some measur(228,11), I remo(71,8)to my own cabin and
attended on him as much as my duty would permit(750,17)ore
interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of
wildness, and even madness,(2032,11)are moments when, if anyone
performs an act of(1611,12)wards him or does him any(1371,9)
trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with
a beam of benevolence and sweetness that(1076,13)equalled. But he
is(303,11)melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his
teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.

When my guest was(812,10)(839,10)I had great trouble to keep off
the men, who wished to ask him a thousand(1947,9)s; but I(1814,11)allow(1183,8)be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body
and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
Once(1879,13)e lieutenant asked why(1451,8)come so far upon the ice
in so strange a vehicle.

His(625,14)nstantly assumed an aspec(459,9)deepest gloom, and
he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”

“And did(1912,12)m you pursued travel in the same fashion?”

“Yes.”

“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day(1318,8)we picked you up we
saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with(1895,10)it, across(349,8).”

This aroused the(363,8)r’s attentio(2037,8)e asked a multitude of
(654,9) concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had
pursued. Soon after, when(1569,9)lone with me, he said, “I have,
doubtless, excited your(747,12)as well a(968,8)f these good
people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”

“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to
(1043,8)you with any inquisitiveness of min(653,10)yet you rescued me from a(819,10)nd perilous situation; you have
(1407,9)tly(1998,10)me to life.”

(404,10) this h(257,8)ed if I thought that the breaking up of the
ice had destroyed the other sledge. I(910,8)(1532,8)c(1242,8) answer
(283,9)degree of certainty(826,10)(108,8)not broken until near
midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety
before that time; but of this(185,13)judge.

From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame(327,8)(929,8). He manifes(50,8)greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for
the sledg(935,8)had(1138,8)appeared(1636,8)have persuaded(1635,8)remain in
the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the raw(724,8)the atmosphere.
(110,8)romis(525,8)someone should(198,10) him and give him(1547,8)
notice if any new object(67,8)appear in sight.

Such is my journal of what relates to this(1684,9)occurrence up to the
present day. T(1367,11) has gradually improved in health but is very
sil(1072,8)appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentl(723,8)he sailors are all
interested in him, although they have had very little communication
with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his
constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must
have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
so attractive and amiable.

My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my
admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so
noble a(599,10)(1787,10)(380,9) without feel(284,8)most poignant
grief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and
when he speaks(953,11)his words are culled with the choicest art,
yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.

He is now much recovered from his illness and is(576,8)ally on(1806,8)k,
apparently watching(2037,9)sledge that preceded his own. Yet(1200,10)
unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by(65,8)(431,8)but that he(1297,9)s himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently
convers(375,8)me on mine, which(1916,8)(1353,10)ed to him(573,8)
disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my
eventual succ(399,9)nto every minute detail(1977,8)measures I had taken
to secure it. I was easily led by the(1443,10)which he evinced to use the
languag(1343,8)heart, to give utterance to the burning ard(217,9) soul
and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would
sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope,(152,8)furtherance(366,8)nterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for
the acquirement(406,8)knowledge(581,9)sought,(815,9)dominion(1649,9)
acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a
dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I
perceived(871,8) tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before
his eyes,(1474,8)voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle
fast from between his fingers; a groan bur(40,8)his heaving breast. I
paused; at length he(311,8)in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you
share my madness? Have you drunk also(924,8)intoxicating draught? Hear me;
let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”

Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the
paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened
power(490,8)any hours of repos(726,10)quil conversation were
necessary to restore his composure.

Having conquered the violence of his(1994,8)s, he appeared to despise
(1582,8)for be(2037,8)slave of passion; and quell(35,8)dark tyranny of
despair, he (709,8)gain to(226,8)e concerning myself personally. He asked
me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it
awakened various trains of reflection.(1069,8) of my desire of finding a
friend, of my thirst for a more intimat(1604,12)ith a fellow mind than
had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could
boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.

“I agree with you,” repli(732,15); “we are
unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than
ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to
perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had(98,9), the most
noble of human(210,12)and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting
friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for(831,8). But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life
anew.”

As he said this hi(1755,13) became(614,8)ive of a calm, settled
(1269,11)touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently
retired to his cabin.

Eve(1625,9)in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he
does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight
afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of
elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he
may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he
has (371,8)into himself, he will be like a celestial(383,8)that has a
halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.

Will you smile at the enthusiasm I(1252,8)(1547,12)this divine
wanderer? You would not if you saw him(879,11)been tutored and
refined by books and retirement from(923,10), and you are(1008,10)
somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to
appreciate the extraordinary merits of this(635,11)man. Sometimes I
have endeavou(1978,8)iscover what quality it is which he possesses that
elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I
believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing
(829,8) judg(45,8)penetration into the cause(292,8)ngs, unequalled
for clearness(1148,8)cision; add to this a facility of(1273,9)on and a
voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.




August 19th, 17—.


Yesterday(1865,13) said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain
Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had
determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with
me, but y(1758,8)won me to alter my (106,8)ation. You seek for
knowledge and wisdom, as(1955,8)did; and I ardently hop(168,10)
gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine
has been. I do not know(273,10)rel(100,9)my disasters(1346,8)
useful to you; yet, when I reflect that(1101,9)pursuing the same
course, exposing yourself(1888,8)same danger(973,9)ave rendered me
what I am, I imagine(121,10)may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one
that may direct you(1382,9)ucceed in your undertaking and console you
in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrence(1190,8)are usually
deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scen(2038,12) I might
fear to encounter(188,8)belief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things
will appear possible in these wild and mysterious region(1406,8)would
provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers
(231,9); nor can I doubt but that(470,8) conveys in its series
internal evidence of the truth(13,8)events of which it is composed.”

(1208,15)(633,13)I was much gratified by the offered
communication, yet I c(2016,9)endure that he(1160,8)renew his grief by
a recital of his(1276,16)felt the greatest eagerness(656,8)
the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and(26,13)a strong
desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I(1672,8)ed
these feelings in my answer.

“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is
useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I
shall repose in peace. I understand your(197,8),” continued he,
perceiving(556,9)ished to interrupt him; “(1642,8)are mistaken, my
friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can(1703,9)
destiny; listen to my history, and(87,10)(1942,8) how irrevocably it is(1884,11).”

He then told (1891,8)he would commence his(620,10) the next day w(364,8)ould be at leisure. This(686,8) drew from me the warmest thanks. I have
resolved every nigh(1710,10)am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to
record, a(580,9)as(1305,13)his own words, what he has related during
the day. If I(996,8)be engaged, I will at least make notes. This
manuscript will doubtless afford you(1022,14)pleasure; but to me, who
know him, and who hear it from(214,9)lips—with what interest and
(892,8) shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I(536,10)my
task, his full-toned voice swell(1050,8)ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me
with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in
animation, while the lineam(1574,8)his face are irradiat(1525,10)soul
within. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which
embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!




Chapter 1


I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is on(1841,9)most
distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years
counsellors and syndics(127,11)ther had filled several public
situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who
knew him for his integr(1777,8)indefatigable attention to(132,8)business. He passed his younger days perpetual(1123,15)the
affair(591,9)country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
marrying early, nor was it until the decline of lif(1442,10)became a
husband(1785,8)(385,8)of a family.

As the(146,15)of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot
refrain from relating them. One(83,9)ost intimate friends was a
merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
mischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a
proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in(115,8)
and oblivion in the same(528,8) where he had formerly been(909,15)(713,8)rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,
therefore,(126,8)most honourable manner, he retreated with his
daughter to the town of Lucerne,(192,10)lived unknown and in
wretchedness. M(1020,9)loved(374,9) with the truest(527,8)hip and
was deeply grieved by his(178,8) in these unfortunat(715,15).
He bitterly deplore(783,8)lse pride which led his friend to a conduct
so little worthy(1344,8)affection that united them. He lost no time in
endeavouring to seek him out,(273,10)hope of persuading him to begin
the world again(781,9)his credit and assistance.

(375,9)had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
months before(1498,11)discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this(40,9)y,
he hastened(619,8)house, which was situated in a mean street near the
Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him.(1035,9)
had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck(1520,8)fortunes, but
it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months,(849,8)the meantime he hoped to procure some(1811,8)able employment in(1373,11)’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;
his grief only(1642,8)more deep and rankling(394,9)had leisure for
reflection, and at length it took so fast hold(1676,9)ind that at the end
of thre(303,8) he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.

His (1268,9)attended(418,10)the greatest tenderness, but she saw
with(611,9)that their(1079,8)fund was rapidly decreasing and that
there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline(699,10)possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to(94,8)
her in her adversity. She(622,8)d plain work; she plaited straw and
by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely(811,14)
support life.

Several(494,8)passed in this manner. Her(1648,8)grew worse; her time
was more entirely occupied in atten(1393,8); her means of subsistence
decreased; and(2020,8)tenth month h(136,10)died(339,9)rms, leaving
her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt
by(1878,9)’s coffin weeping(1791,9), when(1457,11)entered the
chamber. He came like a protecting spirit(1448,8)poor girl, who
committed herself to his care; and after t(1143,8)ment(1335,9)riend he
conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the(161,9)on of a
relation. Two years(122,9)is even(828,11)became his wife.

this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted
affection. (154,12)sense of justice i(473,11)’s upright mind

strongly. Perhaps during former years(1517,8)suffered(1827,9)

a greater value on tried worth(289,15)how of gratitude and
worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholl(2030,10)

virtues and a desire to be (2022,8)s of, in some degree, recompens(1080,8)for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace
to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes
(1616,10)nvenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is
sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her
with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion(1773,8)soft and
benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto
constant spirit, had been shaken by what(441,9)gone through. During
the t(1226,9)that had elapsed previous to their marriage(1513,11)had
gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after
their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change
of scene and interest attendant on a tour(271,8) that land of wonders,
as a restorativ(870,9) weakened frame.

From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born
at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained
for several(481,9)eir only child. Much as they were attached to each
other, they(1638,11)draw inexhaustible stores of (1624,9) from a very
mine of love to bestow them upon me. M(1320,8)’s tender caresses and
(1672,12)smile of (852,11)pleasure while regarding me are my
first recollections. I wa(289,8)plaything(602,8)ir idol, and something
better—their(456,8)the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on
them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot(1557,10)
their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according(508,9)fulfilled
their duties towards me. With this deep conscious(1897,8)what they owed
(59,8)the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit
of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during
every hour of my(855,8)life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,
and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all(839,8)but
one train of enjoyment to me.

For a long time(679,13)only car(822,12) had much desired to have a
daughter, but I continue(739,8)single offspring. When I was about five
years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers(1459,11)they
passed a week on the sh(1094,8)the Lake of Como. Their(1006,11)
disposition often made them enter the cottag(85,10)poor. This, to my
mother, was more than a duty;(870,8)a necessity, a
passion—remembering(1906,14)suffered, and how(1932,9)been
relieved—(1623,8)to act in her turn the guardian angel to the

of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst
shape. One day, when (1529,9) had gone by himself to Milan, m(1601,8),
(1839,12)by me,(1946,9)this abode. She found a peasa(1466,8)is wife,
hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to
five hungry babes. Among these there was one which (416,10)(219,9) far
above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were
dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her
hair(1866,8) brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her
clothing,(1319,8)to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was
clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips(2036,8) moulding of
her face so expressive of sensibility and sweet(1703,10)none could behold
her without looking(196,8)as(436,8)stinct species, a being heaven-sent,
and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.

The(740,9)woman, perceiving that(614,12)ixed eyes of wonder and
admira(383,8)this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was
not her child, but the (1707,8) of a Milanese nobleman. Her(1778,8)was a
German and had died on giving her birth. The(2040,8)(1419,8) placed with
these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been
long marri(1539,8)their eldest(844,11)but just born. The(1258,8)(1487,8)
charg(1049,10)of those Italians nursed(1510,8)memory(1860,8)antique glory

weakness. Whether he(442,11)r still linger(218,10)dungeons of Austria
was not known. His property was confiscated; (1223,10)became an orphan and
a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloom(381,9)ir rude
abode, fairer than a garden ros(380,8)dark-leaved brambles.

W(1779,14)returned from(1770,8)(1719,9)playing with me(2028,8)hall of
our villa a child(149,13)pictured cherub—a creature who seemed
to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter
than the chamois(676,8)hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his
permission(1817,11)prevailed(1560,8)rustic guardians to yield(858,14)to her. T(994,9)fond(834,8)sweet orph(1148,8)presence had(292,8)a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in(1801,8)

(964,11)inmate of my(772,8)’ house—my more than
sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and
my pleasures.

Everyone loved(168,10). The passionate and almost reverential
attachment with which all rega(343,9)became, while I shared it, my
pride and my delight. On the evening previous(487,8)being brought to
my home,(1900,11)had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my
Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she
present(333,12) to me as her promised gift, I, with childish
seriousness, interpre(2028,8)words literally and looked upon(617,10)
as mine—mine to(716,8), love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on
her I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other
familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body
forth the kind of relation in which she stood to m(829,21), since till death she was to be mine only.




Chapter 2


We were(628,9)up together; there (1846,8)quite a year difference in
our ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of
disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our(1048,10)ship, and
the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us
nearer(260,9).(1254,11)was of a calmer and more concentrated
disposition; but, with(1210,8)ardour, I was capable of a more intense
application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
She busied herself with following the aerial creation(1899,9)poets;
and in the majestic and wondrous scenes(688,8)urrounded our Swiss
home —the sublime shape(2005,9)mountains,(2035,8)ng(30,10)seasons,
tempest and calm, the silence of winter(1715,10)life and turbu(39,8)
our Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admir(394,10)(1483,8)
While my(1698,11)contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the
magnificent appearanc(283,8)ings, I(1601,8)ed in investigating their
causes. The world(1023,8)me a secret which I desired to divine.
Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,
gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the
earliest sensations I can remember.

On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave
up entirely their wandering(568,10)fixed themselves in their native
country. We(1598,8)ed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,
the eastern shore(899,8)lake, at the distance of rather(1547,10) a
league from the city. We resided principally(977,8)lat(817,12)
lives of(302,12)were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my
temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was
in(1637,8)t, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united
myself(1217,8)bond(1248,9)closest friendship to on(659,11)m. Henry
Clerval(1675,11)n of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular
talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hard(1751,9) even danger for
its own sake(108,9)deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He
composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and
knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays(519,8)enter into
masquerades, in which(1546,8)(1954,8)were drawn(739,10)heroes of
Roncesvalles,(1729,8)Round T(1892,8)King Arthu(1571,11)chivalrous
train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchr(882,11)hands
of the infidels.

No human being could hav(855,9)a happier childhood than myself. My
(911,14)(1131,9)by the very(1622,8)of kindness and indulgence.
We felt that(1432,11)not the tyrants to rule our lot according to
their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many(1854,8)s
which we enjoyed. When I mingl(1855,8)other families I distinctly
discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted
the development of filial love.

My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some
law in m(78,8)ature(1817,11)turned not towards childish pursuits
but to an eager desire(1952,9), an(67,8) learn all things
indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,
nor the code of governments, (29,8)politics of various states
(1827,11)ttractions for me(1603,9)the secrets of heaven and earth
that I desired(255,9); and whether i(76,10)outward sub(1857,9)
things or the inner(832,11)nature(1061,9)mysterious soul of man
that occupied me, still my inquirie(1208,8)irected to the metaphysical,
or in its highest sense, the (39,8)(275,12)the world.

Meanwhile (1700,8)(146,9)himself, so to speak, with the moral
relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,
(1357,8)(465,8)of men were his theme; and his hope(13,9)dream was
to become(1924,13)ose whose names are recorded in story as the
gallant and(1681,9)ous benefac(1172,8)our species. The saintly soul
of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet gl(679,8)her celestial eyes, were ever there to bl(1517,8)animate us. She was
the living(1571,11)love to soften an(916,9); I might have become
sullen in my study, rough th(8,8)e ardour of my natur(1570,9)at
she(994,8)re to subdue me to a semb(251,8) her own gentleness. And
Clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble(1812,11)Clerval? Yet
he might no(231,9)en so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his
generosity, so full(1913,17)tenderness amidst his(1578,8) for
(676,12)exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of
beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring
ambition.

I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling(359,8)recolle(1018,10)childhood,
before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of
extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow ref(142,9)upon self. Besides,
in drawing the pi(1768,9)my early days, I also record those events which
led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would
account to myself for the birth of that(568,9)which afterwards ruled my
destiny I find it arise,(1215,8)mountain river, from ignoble and almost
forgotten sources; but, s(507,8)as it proceeded, it became the torrent
which,(1756,8)course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.

Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,
therefore, in this narration, to state those fac(478,8) led to my
predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went
on a party of(856,10)to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the
weather obliged us to remain a day confined(92,8)inn. In this house I
chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it
with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful
(388,12)he relates soon(1062,9)this feeling into enthusiasm. A new
light seemed to dawn upon(1144,8), and bounding with joy, I communicated my
discovery to my father. M(11,8) looked carelessly at the title page of my
book and said, “Ah!(350,18)! My dear Victor, do not waste
your time upon this; it is sad trash.”

If, instead of this remark,(199,10) had taken the pains to explain to me
that the principles of(526,8) had been entirely exploded and that a modern
system of(837,8)(63,10)introduced which possessed much greater powers
than the ancient, because the powers(716,8)latter were chimerical, while
thos(759,9)form(43,8)real and practical, under such circumstances I
should certainly have thrown(302,9)aside and have contented my
imagination, warmed as it was, by return(692,9)(275,8)ardour to my
former studies. It is even possible (467,9)train of my ideas would never
have received the fatal impulse that(1326,10) ruin. But the cursory glance
(629,20)of my(1144,8)by no means assured me that he was
acquainted with its(322,8)s, and I continued to read with the greatest
avidity.

When I returned home my first care was to procure the whol(1314,11)this
author, and(1954,12)of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and
studied the wild fancie(713,8)se writers with delight; they appeared(951,8)reasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always
having been imbu(382,8)a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of
nature. In spit(1640,9)intense labour and(1554,10) (1406,8)ies of(1093,8)philosophers, I always came from my(767,8) dis(868,10)and unsatisfied.
Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed(645,9)felt like a child picking
up shells beside(625,10) and unexplored ocean of truth. T(1151,8)his
successors in each branch of natural (256,9)y with whom I was (802,10)
(527,9)even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same
pursuit.

The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and(150,16)(909,8)ir(1366,10) uses. The most learned(232,10)er knew little
more. He had partially unveil(1193,9)ce of Nature, but her immortal
lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect,
anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes
in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly un(977,9)him. I
had gazed upon(1736,8)tifications and impediments that seemed to keep
human beings from entering the citadel(649,9)e, and rashly and
ignorantly I had repined.

But here were books, and(21,11)men who had(1094,10)d deeper and knew
more. I took their word for all(1755,9)y averred(1561,8)became their
disciple. It ma(1341,8) strange that such should arise(795,8)eighteenth
century; but while I followed the routine of education(868,9)chools of
Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regar(1917,8)favourite
(2042,9)M(1907,9)was not scientific(1839,8)was left to struggle with a
child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.
Under the guidance of my new preceptors I enter(2004,8)(1961,13)diligence into the search(1598,8)(1547,11)’s stone an(1170,8)ixir
of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an
inferior object, but what glory would attend the(1729,9)y if I could
banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but
a violent death!

Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a
promise liberally accorded by(623,13) authors, the fulfilment of which
I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were(2002,8)unsuccessful, I
attribut(1508,9)ilure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a
want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was
occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand
contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of
multifarious(904,10), guided by an ardent imagination and childish
reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.

When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near
Belrive, when we witnessed a most(760,9)and terrible thunderstorm. It
advanced from behind the mountains of Jura,(1080,9)thunder burst at once
with frightful loudness from various quarters(1183,8)heavens. I remained,
while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an
old and beautiful oak which(99,8)bout twenty yards from(443,10); and so
soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappea(1967,9)nothing
(310,8) but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found
the tree shattered in a singular manner. It(1841,10)plintered by the
shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld
anything so utterly destroyed.

Before this I(1981,9)unacquaint(1836,12)more obvious laws of
electricity. On this occasion a man of great research in natural
(1880,9)y was with us, and excit(273,8)is catastrophe, he(1999,9)on
the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject(202,15) and galvanism, which was(932,8) new and astonishing to me.
All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,
Albertus Magn(267,8)Paracelsus, the lords(1295,8)(1380,10); but by
some fatality the overthrow of(1971,8)en disinclined me to pursue my
accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if(838,8) would or could ever
be known. (283,10)ad so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
despicable. By one of those caprice(1289,9)mind(433,8)e are perhaps
most(497,9)to in early youth, I(478,9)gave up my former
occupations, set dow(708,9) history and all(1367,9)eny as a deformed
and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of
real(1978,10). In this mood of mind I betook myself to the
mathematics(1737,9)branches of study appertaining to that(179,9)as
being built upon secure found(361,8)and so worthy of my consideration.

Thus strangely are our souls construct(1518,8)by such slight ligaments
are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, it seems to me
as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the
immediate sugges(1230,8)the guardian angel of my life—the last effort
made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even
then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was
announced by an unusual tranquill(1389,9)ladness of soul which
followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting
(1207,12)was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with
their prosecution, happiness(1822,9)ir disregard.

It was a strong effort(1188,8)(402,10)good, but it was ineffectual.
Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
terrible destruction.




Chapter 3


When I had at(1161,11)age of seventeen my parents resolved that I
should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had
hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it
necessary for the comple(839,8)my education(521,8)(181,9) made
acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My
departure(982,8)refore fixed at a(1659,8)date, but before the day
(345,9)upon could arrive, the first misfortun(141,8)life
occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.

Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was
in(1729,15)anger. During(67,13)many arguments had been urged to
persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first
yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her
favourite was menaced, she(1918,8)o longer control her anxiety. She
(728,9)her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity
of the distemper—(451,10)was saved, but the consequences of this
imprudence were fatal to her(1581,8)er. On the third day(397,10)
sicken(197,8)fever was accompanied(1672,8)most alarming symptoms, and the
looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her
deathbed the fortitude and benignity(258,8) best of women did not desert
(586,9)jo(1293,9)hands of (817,10)and myself. “My
children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of(901,8)(1614,11)ere
placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the
consola(1273,8)your father.(189,10), my love, you must supply my place to
my younger (222,8). Alas! I regret(1878,8)am taken from you; and, happy
and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are
not(1528,8)s befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”

She died calmly(1953,10)countenance expressed affection even in death.
I nee(643,9)cribe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent
by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the
soul(922,9) despair that is exhibit(677,10)(232,11). It is so
long(1752,12)mind can (1493,9)(117,8)hat she whom we saw every day
and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed
for ever—(1501,9)brightness of a(665,9)eye(64,10)been
extinguished(278,9)sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear
can be hushed, never more to be heard. T(740,8) the reflections of
(2044,10)days;(1725,10)the lapse of time proves the real(1271,9)e
(521,9)n the actual bitter(271,8)grief commences. Yet from whom has
not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I
(744,9)a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at
length arrives when grief is rather an(982,8)nce than a necessity; and
the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a
sacrilege, is not banished. M(1840,8) was dead, but we had still
duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the
rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the
spoiler has not seized.

My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,
was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of
some weeks. It(1041,10)to me (403,9) so soon to leav(859,8)pose,
akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of
life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm m(55,8)
unwilling(1789,9)the sight(1531,10)that remain(233,8), and above
all, I desired to see my sweet(2042,10) in(932,8)gree consoled.

She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
She looked steadily on life and assumed its (764,8)ith courage and
zeal. She devoted her(1705,10)ose whom she(629,10)ta(826,8)call
her uncle and cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time,
when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.

The day of m(905,12)at (1290,13)d. Clerval(140,10) last
evening with us. He had(121,10)ed to(1957,10)his(892,8)to permit
him to accompany me(800,8)become my fellow student, but in vain. His
fa(1301,9)a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the
aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the misfortune
of being debarr(1142,8)a liberal education. He said little,(1923,9)
he spoke I read in his kindling eye an(24,9)animated glance a
restrained but firm resolve not to be ch(1019,9)the miserable details
of commerce.

We sat late. We could not tear(1559,11)away from each other nor
(522,9)(1603,10)to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and we
retired under the pretence of seeking(1425,8) each fancying that the
(1858,12)ceived;(381,9) at morning’s dawn I descend(300,9)
carriage(1893,8)as to convey me away, they were all there—(1664,9)
again to bless me,(873,9)to press my hand once more, my(1404,11)to
renew her entreaties that I would write often(859,10)stow(971,10)feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.

I threw myself(1734,10)chai(1628,8)(278,21) and indulged in
the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by
amiable companions, continually engaged in(1302,10)ing(266,11)mutual
pleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I
must form my own friends and be(22,8)protector. My life had hitherto
been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible
repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers,(2012,10), and
Clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself
totally unfitted for(2030,8)pany of strangers. Such were m(522,13) as
I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I
ardently desired the acquis(1526,9)knowledge. I had often,(1063,9)home,
thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had
longed to enter(1300,8)ld and take my station among other human beings.
Now m(217,8)s were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
repent.

I had sufficient leisure(460,8)se and many other(442,13)(266,9)
journey to Ingolstadt,(1351,11)long and fatiguing. At length the
high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was
conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.

The nex(1581,9) I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to
som(196,9)principal professors. Chance—or rather the evil
influence, the Angel of Destruction(351,8)asserted omnipotent sway over me
from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from (1741,9)’s
door—led me first to M. Krempe,(207,10) of natural philosophy. He
was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He
asked me several questions concerning my progress(84,8)different branches
of(91,8) appertaining to(198,21)I replied carelessly, and
partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as(538,14)
authors I had studied. The(358,11)stared. “Have you,” he
said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”

(219,10)in the affirmative. “Every minute,”(1920,8)ed(517,10) with
warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly
and entirely lost. Y(61,8)burdened your memory with exploded systems
and useless names. Good God! In what desert land have you lived,
where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you
have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they
are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific
age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear
sir, you must begin your studies(442,10)anew.”

So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of(990,9)books
treating(1120,22) which he(2034,9)me to procure, and
dismissed me after(930,8)ing that(1149,8)beginning(1660,8)following
week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon(1299,8)
(179,11)in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow
(1594,9), would(106,8) upon chemistry the alternate days that he
omitted.

I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long
considered those (1216,8)(889,8)whom t(1214,13)reprobated; but I
(134,9)not at all the more inclined to recur to these(627,9)in any
shape.(1172,12)as a(809,8)squat man with a gruff voice and a
repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
favour(1726,8)pursuits. In(2020,8)a too(1827,10)ical and connected a
strain, perhaps,(393,8)given an account(679,8)conclusion(1599,8)come
to(1817,12)them in my early years. As a child I had not been
content with the results promised by the modern(1703,10)s(942,11)
(1987,9)With a confusion of ideas only to be(218,8)ed for by my
extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the
steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the
discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten(2038,11).
Beside(159,9)a contempt(66,9)uses of(341,8)(1269,18).
It was very different when the masters(1221,8)science sought
immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now
the scene was changed. The ambition(1351,8)(295,8) seemed to limit
itself to the annihila(59,10)ose visions on which my interest in(608,8) was chiefly founded. I was required to(471,9) chimeras of
boundless grandeur for realities of(1910,8)worth.

Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my
residence at Ingolstadt, whi(92,8)(209,8)spent in becoming
acquainted(928,10)loc(177,8)and the principal residents in my new
abode. But as the ensuing week(1761,9)d, I though(1140,9)information
which(1406,11)had given me(1155,15)(1824,9). And(618,10)I
could not consent to go and hear that(1491,8)conceited fellow deliver
sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.
(1912,9)whom(1297,8)ever seen, as(53,8)hitherto been(110,8)town.

Partly from curios(878,9)(26,11)idleness, I went into(293,11)ing
room(530,8)M. Waldman entered shortly after. This(1904,11)(1061,8)
unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an
aspect expressive(1666,8)greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his
temples, but those at the back(1859,8)head were nearly black. His person
was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
He began his(683,8) by a recapitu(1183,12)e history of chemistry and
the various improvements made b(1464,12)men of learning, pronouncing
with fervour the name(1499,9)most distinguished (1705,8)ers. He then took
a cursory view(1566,8)present stat(463,9)(1587,8)and explained many of
its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he
conclud(1220,8)a panegyric upon(1796,8)(347,9), the terms of which I
shall never forget:

“The ancient teach(1812,9)is(1813,8),” said he,
“promised impossibi(1357,11)performed nothing. The(1958,8)masters
promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that
the elixir of life is a(1718,8) but these philosophers, whose hands seem
only made to dabble in dirt,(1574,8)ir eyes to pore over the microscope or
crucible, have indee(281,12)miracles. They penetrate(1240,10)recesses
of nature and show how she works in her hiding-plac(88,9)ascend(1325,9)
heavens; they have(773,10)d how the blood circulates(253,9)(137,8)of
the air we breathe. T(85,9)acquired new and almost unlimited powers;
they can comm(1930,8)thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even
mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”

Such were the(1545,10)’s words—rather let me say such the words(261,8)fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul
were grappling(989,10)lpable enemy; one by one (1327,12)keys were
touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was
sounded, and soon my mind was fill(1152,8)one thought, one conception,
one purpose. So much has been done, exclai(166,8)soul of
Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps
already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and
unfold to(498,8)ld the deepest mysteries of creation.

I closed not my eyes that night. My internal being was in a(1624,9)
insurrection and turmoil;(579,8)that order would thence arise, but I
had no power to produce it. By degrees, aft(1220,8)orning’s dawn,
sleep came. I awo(883,8)my yesternight’s(523,8)s were as a dream.
There only remained a resolution to return to my(1672,9)stud(1618,8)to
devote myself to a(1915,9)for(1760,8) believed(41,11)possess a
natural talent. On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His
manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,
for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in
his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I
gave him pretty nearly(279,10)account of my former pursuits as I had
given to his fellow(1364,10). He heard with attention the little
narration concerning my(519,13)smiled at the names of Cornelius
Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had
exhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal
modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their
knowledg(1884,10)d left to us, as an easier task, to give new names
and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a
great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. The
labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
fail in ultimately turning(1447,8)solid advantage of mankind.” I
listened(680,8)statement, which was delivered(561,9)any presumption
or affectation, and then added that(946,13)had removed my
prejudices against modern chemists; I express(1225,10)in measured
terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his
instructor,(789,9)letting escape (inexperience in life would have
made me ashamed) any(715,8)enthusiasm which stimulated my intended(534,8). I requested his advice(1032,12)the books I ought to
procure.

“I am happy,” s(1476,14), “to have gained a
disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of
your success. Chemistry is that branch of (1661,8)(1045,9)y in(875,10)
(1454,9)improvements have been and may be made; it is on that(1449,9)that
I have made it my peculiar study; but(1352,8)same time(225,11)t
neglected the other branches of(1917,8). A man would make but a very sorry
chemist if he attended to that department of human (1274,9) alone. If your
wish is to become really a man(153,11) and not merely a petty
experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every(456,18)
(456,10), including mathematics.”

He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his
various machines, (966,8)ing me as to what(803,11) procure and
promising(96,11) of his own when(269,10)have advanced far enough in
the(358,9)not to derange their mechanism. He also gave(217,8)list of
book(1645,8)I had(1032,10), and I took my leave.

Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.




Chapter 4


From this day(931,19), and particularly(1446,8)ry, in the
most comprehensive sense(2012,8)term, became nearly my sole occupation.
I read with ardour those works, so full(1856,10) and discrimination,
which(1619,8)inquirers have written on these subjects. I(921,11)he
lectures and cultiva(1037,8)acquaintanc(228,9)me(893,13)of the
university(465,8)found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense
and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive
physiognomy and manners, but not(1345,19)e less valuable. In
(1616,10)(197,9)a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by
dogmatism, and his(967,10)ons were given with an air of frankness and
good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways
he smoothed for(1142,8)path of(1410,12)nd made the most abstruse
inquiries clear and facile to my ap(789,8)on. My(1892,13)was at
first fluctuating and uncertain; it(1978,8)strength as I proceeded and
soon(869,8)so ardent and eager th(1776,8)tars often disappeared(974,8)light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my(1482,11).

As I applied so closely, it(1981,8)easily conceived that my progress
was rapid. My(1034,8)was inde(900,8)stonish(1847,8)the students, and
my proficiency tha(41,9)masters. Professor(903,8)often asked me,
with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on,(301,8)(815,10)
expressed(576,10)heartfelt exultation in(261,12). Two years

engaged, heart and soul(1479,8) pursuit of some discoverie(1701,9)
hoped to make. None but(1448,8)ho have experienced them can(498,9)
of the enticements(1339,11). In other studies you go as far as
oth(1491,9)gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
a scientific(254,9)(59,9)continual food for(274,9)y and wonder.
A mind of moderate capacity which(774,8) pursues one study must
infallibly arrive at great(706,13)in that study; and I, who
(171,9)ly sought the attain(802,8)one object of(493,9)and was
solely wrapped up(623,8), improved so rapidly that at the end of two
years I made(581,18)in the(80,8)(954,8)some chemical
instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at(1908,15). When I had arrived at this point and had become as well
(2018,8)ed with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
depended on(1873,9)ons of any(1201,8)p(1151,8)s at Ingolstadt, my
residence there being no longer conduciv(1643,8)(343,11)s, I thought
of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
happen(1448,8)protracted my stay.

One(211,9)henomena which had peculiarly at(62,11)atten(1802,8)
the structur(79,9)human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with
life. Whence, I(1489,14)yself, did the principle of life(1874,8)?
It was a bold question, and one(221,9)s ever been considered as a
mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming(649,11), if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined
thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of
(803,19)which relate to physiology. Unless I had been
animated by an almost super(895,8)enthusiasm, my application to this
study would have been irksome and(89,8)intolerable. To examine the
causes(561,8), we must first have recourse to death. I became(1113,21)science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I
must also observe the(1163,9)decay and corruption(849,14)body.
In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
mind should be impress(1337,8)no(423,14)horrors. I do not ever
remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition o(46,10)feared
the appari(242,8)a spirit. Darkness had no effect up(248,8)ncy, and
a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of
life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength,(1675,11)
food for the worm. Now I was led t(665,13) cause and progress of
this(528,11)forced to spend days and nights in vaults and
charnel-houses. M(1459,15) fixed upon every object the most
insupportable to the delicac(1798,9)human feelings. I saw how the
fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the(762,14)
death succeed(136,8)blooming cheek(1540,8);(128,14) worm
inherited the wonders(1990,8)eye and brain. I paused, examining and
analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change
from lif(1118,10), and death to life, until from the midst of this
d(780,8)a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and
wondrous, yet so simple, that while(1268,9) dizzy(1263,10)immensity
of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so
many men of genius who had directed their (1805,9) towards the same
scienc(191,8)I alone(1237,11)reserved to discover so astonishing a
secret.

Remember, I am not record(1028,8)vis(1185,9)madman. The sun does not
more certainly shine(525,8)heavens than(372,9)ch I now affirm is
true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stage(732,8)
(238,8)y were distinct(1128,8)bable. After(1101,17)of
incredible labour and fatigue, I(915,8)ed in(347,9)(1323,8)cause of
generation and life; nay, more,(619,10)myself capable of bestowing
animation upon lifeless matter.

The(466,9)men(340,10)had a(2019,8)experienced on this(532,9)y
soon gave place to delight and raptur(306,9)so much time spent in
painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the
most gratifying consumma(1819,8)my toils. But(199,15) was so
great and overwhelming that(1221,9)steps by(302,13)been
(1672,8)ively(1715,8)it were obliterated, and(1470,10)on(1895,9)sult.
What(86,9) the study and desire(1610,8)wisest men since the creation(1135,8)world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it
all open(1786,8)m(408,9): the information I had obtained was of a
nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I(1166,8)point them
(1223,12)objec(523,8)search than to exhibit that(1954,8)already
accomplished. I was like the Arabian(1361,9)been buried(1487,10)dead
and found a passage(1676,10)aided only by one glimmering and seemingly
ineffectual light.

I see by your eagerness an(1934,12) and hope which your eyes
express, my friend, that you expect to b(442,8)ed(2009,8)secret with
(1376,8)am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end
of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am(1660,10)upon that
subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,
to your destruc(1373,9)infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my
precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of
knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town
to be(998,10), than he who aspires to become greater than(76,8)ure
will allow.

When I found(2037,17) power placed(1101,11)hands, I hesitated
a long time concern(1769,8)manner in(1991,9)should employ it.
Although I possessed the capacity(1774,13) (1774,9), yet to
prepare a frame for the recep(1558,8)it, with all its intricacies of
fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
difficulty and labour. I doubte(1899,11)whether(1277,10)attempt the
(1495,8) of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my
imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to
doub(1929,8)ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful
as man. The materials at present(1710,11)command hardly appeared
adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but(370,11)not that(1639,9)
ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my
operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be
imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes
place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my(378,8)
attempts would(1261,10)lay the foundations of future(560,8). Nor
could(192,11) the magnitude and(535,8)ity of my plan as any
argument of its impracticability. It was(1948,9)se feelings that I
began the (832,14)human being. As the minuteness(1809,8)parts
formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to(844,9)
intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,
about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having(206,8)this determ(1038,8)and having spent some months in(1037,8)fully
collecting and arranging my(971,10), I began.

No one can conceive the variety of(445,10)which bore me onwards, like
a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of(651,10)Life and death
(1082,8) to me ideal bounds,(1679,16)first break through, and
pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new specie(848,8)bless
me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natur(75,8)
owe their being to me. No father could claim the gra(1216,10)his
child so completely as(1942,10)deserve theirs. Pursuing these
reflections, I thought that if I could bestow(1961,10) upon lifeless
matter, I might in proc(910,8)ime (although I now found it impossible)
renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.

These(204,8)s supported my spirits, while I pursued my(1654,12)
with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my
person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very
brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the
next day or the next hour might realise. One secre(1697,8)I alone
possessed was(99,10)to(889,9)had dedicat(1911,9); and the moon
gazed on my midnight labour(403,8), (379,9)laxed and breathless
eagerness,(445,11)nature to her hiding-places. Who shall(1213,9)
the horrors of my(244,8)toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps
of(916,8)ve or tortu(2027,8)living animal to animate the(826,10)clay? My limbs now tremble(582,8) eyes swim(1836,9) remembrance; but
then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed
to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit(2002,8)
indeed but a passing tranc(1813,8)only made me feel with renewed
ac(1995,8)so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had
returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and
disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top(70,9)ouse,
and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
their sockets in attendi(1155,10)detail(865,8)employment. The
dissecting room(1064,9)slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;
and often did my human(1042,9)urn with loath(190,8) my occupation,
whilst, still urged on by an (1138,9) which perpetually increased, I
brough(346,9) near to a conclus(1695,9) summer months passed(1683,9)was thus engaged, heart and soul, in
(891,19) a most beautiful season; never did the fields
(2005,8) more plentiful harvest(1579,8)vines yield(44,8)luxuriant
vintage, but(1197,9)were insensible(1683,8)charms of nature. And the
same feeling(358,8)(1056,8)neglect the scenes around me caused me also
to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had
not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them, and I
well remembe(1556,8)word(1649,8)father: “I know that while you are
pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall
hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any
interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties
are equally(465,8)ed.”

I knew well therefore what would be(301,10)’s(549,9), but I could
not tear my thoughts(1000,9)(1145,10), loathsome in itself, but which
had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it
were, to procrastinate all that relat(1684,9)(755,9)of(445,10)
until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,
sh(319,8)completed.

I then(292,8) that(652,10)(370,10)unjust if he ascribed m(444,9)
to vice or faultiness on my part(415,8)am now convinced that he was
justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from
blame. A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that th(1468,9) of knowledge
is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply(1059,9)
has a tendency to weaken your(1063,10)s and to destroy your taste for
those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix,(615,8)at
study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human
mind. If(270,10) were(472,8)observed; if no man (806,8)any(1832,8)
whatso(476,8)interfere with the(443,13) of his domestic
(312,10), Greece ha(673,8)en enslaved, Cæsa(847,8)have spared his
country, America(39,12)been discovered more gradually, and the
empires of Mexico and Peru(146,14)destroyed.

But I(1823,10)at I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my
tale, and your looks remind me(1272,8)eed.

M(1112,9)made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my
(1893,8)by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not
watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which befo(687,9)
yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my
(243,10). The leaves (1914,9)ear had withered(122,8)my work drew near
to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had
succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared
rather like one doomed by slavery to toil(675,9)ines, or any other
unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever(200,8)became nervous to a most
painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me(279,8)shunned my fellow
creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at
the wreck I perceiv(1941,8)(85,8)come; the energy of my purpose alone
sustained me:(815,11) would soon end(290,10)lie(106,9)exercise and
amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself
both of these when my creation should be complete.




Chapter 5


It was on a drea(521,9)of November(1339,8)beheld the accomplishment
of my toils. With an(763,8) that almost amounted to agony, I
collected the instruments of life around me,(1479,8)might infuse a
spark of be(1326,9)the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was
already one(1559,10)rning; the rain pattered dismally against the
panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the
half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the (822,8)
open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.

How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate(895,8)tch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to
form? His limbs were in proportion(1379,8)had selected his f(1098,10)
beautiful. B(11,8)! Great God! His(344,8)skin scarcely covered
the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous
black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these
luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,
that seemed(926,8)of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which
they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.

The different accid(1023,15)e not so changeable(155,8)feelings
of human nature. I had worked hard for(908,8)two years, for the sole
(1525,8)of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had
depriv(1444,9) of rest and health(153,8)desired it w(1331,8)rdour
that far exceeded moderation; but now(1731,12)finished, the beauty
of the dream va(34,8)and breathless horror and disgust filled my
heart. Unable to endure the aspec(564,9)being I had created, I
rushed ou(605,9)room and continued a long time traversing my
bed-chamber, u(134,9)compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude
succeeded to the tumul(2046,10)fore endur(287,8)I threw(451,9)n the
bed in my clothes,(1189,10)ing to seek a few mo(1731,9)forgetfulness.
But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed(1582,8)wildest
dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth,(1736,8)bloom of health, walking in
the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,
but as I imprin(1994,8)first kiss on her lips, they became livid with
the hue of death; her(1470,11)ppeared t(1030,8)(429,10)ought that I
held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her
form(1618,8)(1909,8)grave-worms crawling(355,8)folds(1927,8)flannel.
I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew(1637,8) my forehead, my
teeth chatte(678,9)every limb(333,8)convulsed; when,(562,8)dim and
yellow ligh(1517,9)moon, as it forced its way through the window
shutters, I be(362,9)wretch—the miserable monster whom I had
created. He held up the curtain(1101,10)d; and his eyes, if eyes they
may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws open(1269,8)he muttered some
inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have
spoken(945,8)did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to
detain me(1017,8)escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the
courtyard belonging(1266,8)house which I inhabited, where I remained
during the res(1503,9)night(1080,10)up and down(1124,8)greatest
agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if
it were to announce the approach(1658,8)demoniacal(1009,8)to(235,8)
had so(661,9)y given life.

Oh! No mortal could support the(1820,8)of that countenance. A mummy
again endued(1992,8)imation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I
had gazed on him while un(2010,8); he was ugly th(627,8)when those
muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it(1417,8)a thing
such as even Dante(199,11)have conceived.

I passed(549,10) wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and
hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly
sank(2021,8)ground(1220,9)languor and extreme weakness. Mingle(1672,9)is horror,(143,12)bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had
been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a
hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!

Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and dis(1670,8)to my
sleepless and aching(1420,9) church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple
and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates
of the court(74,8)had that night (377,8)asylu(1988,9)issued into
the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the
wretch(1759,8)feare(1941,8)turning(1892,8)street would present to my
view.(1593,11)dare return(1469,8)apartment(1473,20)but
felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured
from a black and comfortless sky.

I continued(1547,9)in this manner for some time, endeavouring by
bodily exercise to ease the lo(457,8)weighed upon my mind. I
traver(1135,8)streets without any clear concep(1080,8)(1764,8)was or
what I was doing. My heart(1137,9)ed(1750,8)sick(1010,8)fear, and I
hurried on with irregular(569,8)not daring to look about me:

 Like one who, on a lonely road,
 Doth walk in fear and dread,
 And, having once turned round, walks on,
 And turns no more his head;
 Because he knows a frightful fiend
 Doth close behind him tread.

 [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]



Continuing thus, I came(1152,11)opposite(1469,8)inn a(752,8)the various
diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;
but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming
towards me from the other end(1026,14). As it drew nearer I observed
that it was the Swiss (243,9); it(224,8) just(730,13)standing, and
on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval,(652,9)seeing me,
instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,
“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at
the very moment of my alighting!”

Nothing could equal my delight(208,11)Clerval; his presence brought back
to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear
to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a(225,8)forgot my horror
and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,
calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore,(1291,8)most cordial
manner, and we walked (779,9)y college.(606,8)(1594,11)talking for
(1579,9) about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being
permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said
he, “how grea(895,10)difficulty to persuade(533,10) that all
necessary knowledge was not compris(1619,10)noble art of book-keeping;
and, indeed, I(167,8) I left him incredulous(1324,8)last, for his constant
answer to my unwearied entreaties(1127,9)same as that(1200,8)Dutch
schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins
a year(1958,9)Greek, I eat heartily(30,14).’ But his
affection for (1588,14)vercame his dislike of learn(1289,8) he has(547,11)me to undertake a voyage of discovery(348,10)nd of
(471,9).”

“It gives me the greatest(1140,9)(1259,10); but tell me how you left
(1117,11)brothers, and(1131,10).”

“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from
you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you(84,11)pon their
account myself. But, m(1544,22)(1004,10)he, stopping
short and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill
you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watch(1148,9)everal nights.”

“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one
occupation that(60,8)not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;
but I hope, I sincerely hope,(1147,9) these employments are now at an
end and(139,8)am(834,11)free.”

I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
allude to, the occurrences(1111,8)preceding night. I(1595,8)with a
quick pace(1628,9)soon arrived at(1629,13)I then reflected, and
the(1988,8) made me shiver,(799,9) creature whom I had left in my
apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to
behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.
Entreating him(1950,13)to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
stairs, I darted up(1973,12)own room. My hand was already on the
lock(1575,8)door(938,8)I recollect(739,9)(418,9)paused, and a
cold shivering came over me. I threw(96,10)forcibly open, as
children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped
fearfully in: the (568,10)was empty, and my bedroom was also freed
from its hideous guest.(895,9)hardly believe that so great a good
fortune(50,9)ve befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy
had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.

We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast(1283,8)was unable to contain(608,10)t was not joy only that possessed
me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness(439,9)pulse
beat rapidly.(151,17)remain for a single instant in the same
place; I jumped over the chairs,(366,17), and laughed aloud.
Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,
(532,9)he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes
for which h(640,8)not account(765,9)loud, unrestrained, heartless
laughter frightened and astonished him.

“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,
is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the
cause of all this?”

“Do not ask me(144,9)I, putting(825,10)before(313,8), for I
(1706,8)I saw the(1601,9)(1206,8)glide into the room; “_he_ can
tell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagin(1002,8)the(1674,8) seized me;
I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.

Poor(1008,8)! What must(1145,8)en his feelings? A meeting,(555,9)
anticipat(2046,8)such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I
(1019,8)the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not
recover my senses for a long, long time.

This was the commencement of a nervous feve(784,8)confined me for
several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I
afterwards lear(468,8), knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness
for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make
Elizabeth, he spared them t(377,9) by concealing the extent of my
disorder. He knew that(1779,9)not have a more kind and(1175,10)
nurse than himself; and, firm(1396,8)hope he felt of my recovery, he
did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest
action that(1282,10)towards them.

B(1738,9)in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and
unremitting(1442,8)ons of my friend could have restored me to life.
The form of(1038,13)on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever
(1228,16)and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my
words surprised Henry; he(1754,10)believ(609,9)o be the wanderings
of my disturbed imagination,(328,9)pertinacity with which I
continually recurred to(1971,9) subject persuaded him that my (713,8)
indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.

By very slow degre(340,8)with frequent relapses that alarmed and
grieved(520,10), I(748,8)ed. I remember the first time I became
capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I
perceiv(1644,12)fallen leaves had disappeared an(1687,11)young
buds were shooting forth from the tre(258,8)shaded my window. It was
a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my
convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in
my bosom; my gloom(247,12), and in a shor(392,15) as
cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.

“Dearest(1949,8),” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good
you are to me. This whole winter(1304,13)being spent in study, as you
promised yourself, has been consumed in(1630,8) room. How shall I ever
repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappoint(1940,8)(993,8)have been the occas(1050,9)you will forgive me.”

“Y(24,8)repay me entirely if you do not discompose(239,11)but get
well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I
may speak to you on on(1176,9), may I not?”

I trembled. O(38,10)! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on
whom I dared not even think?

“C(248,16)” said(634,9) who observed my change of
colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you;(430,8)r father
and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your
own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you (590,10)and are uneasy at
your long silence.”

“I(1454,9)l, my dear Henry? How could you suppose(1628,9)first
thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends(1996,8)love and
who are so de(1502,9)f my love?”

“If this is your present temper,(1629,12)(826,9)perhaps be glad
to see(368,10)that(1025,10)lying here some days for you; it is from
your cousin, I believe.”




Chapter 6


Clerval then put the following(502,8)into my hands(1574,8) from my
own Elizabeth:

“My d(1353,8)ousin,

“Y(511,13)ill, very ill, and(800,8)e constant letters of dear
kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are
forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word(754,9), dear Victor,
is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long(1704,8)have thought
that each pos(678,8)bring this line, and my persuasions have
restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have
prevented his encountering the inconveniences and(693,9)dangers of so
lo(109,12), yet how often have I regretted not being able to
perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on
your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never
guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of
your poo(907,8). Yet that is over now:(1524,8) writes that indeed
you are getting better. I eagerly hope tha(1935,11)confirm this
intelligence soon(1467,8) (1467,16)

“Get well—and return to us. (2005,9)find a happy, cheerful home and
(1347,11) love you dearly. Y(1669,10)’s health is vigorous, and he
asks but to see you,(16,8)be assured(249,10)are well; and not a
care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would
be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixt(1769,8)full
of activity and spirit. He is desirous(224,8) true Swiss and to enter
into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his
elder brother returns(491,8)M(1100,8)is not(275,9)(751,9)idea of
a military career in a dista(348,8)ry, but Ernest never had your
powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his
time is spent in the open air, climb(1230,8)hills or rowing on the
lake. I fea(1908,8)e will become an idler unless we yield the point
and permit him(433,9) on the profession which he has selected.

“Little alteration, except the growth(626,8)dear children, has taken
place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they
never change; and I think our placid(1010,9) our contented hearts are
regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up
my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing
none but(1207,8)kind faces around me. S(309,16), but one
change(359,10) place in our little household. Do you remember on
what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;
I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madam(108,8),
her mother, was a widow with fou(601,12)of whom(176,9)was the
third. This girl had always been the favourite of he(1531,8), but
through a strange perversity, (164,10)(1946,8)ot endure her, and
after the death of M.(231,8) treated her very ill. My aunt observed
this, and whe(409,10)was twelve years of age, prevailed on(167,11)
to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our
country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which
prevail(1291,8)great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less
distinction betw(468,8)several classes of its inhabitants; and the
lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, thei(222,10)are
more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean(1141,9)
thing as a(52,12)France and England.(921,8), thus received in
(924,10), learned the duties of(93,10), a condit(1521,9), in our
fortunate(1825,10)(181,9)include(1894,12) igno(168,10)a
sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.

“(206,9)you may(1170,9)(1018,8)great(937,14)yours; and I
recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one
glance fr(1095,11)could dissipate it, for(1574,10)reason that
Ariosto gives concern(2003,8)beauty of Angelica—she looked so
frank-hearted(834,9)y(1034,10)conceived(271,9)attachment for her,
by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that

(1412,15) most grateful(1669,8)creature(1023,8)world: I do not
mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but
you could see by her ey(1120,9)he almost adored her protectress.
Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,
yet she paid(1263,10)est attention to every gesture of my aunt. She
thought her the model of all excelle(1065,8)endeavoured to imitate her
phraseology and(1442,8), so that even now she often reminds m(1828,8).

“When my dearest aunt died every o(1929,8)oo much occupied in their own

trials were reserved(861,8).

“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and(1911,11), (160,8)

conscien(1367,10)woman was troubled; she began to think that the
deaths(124,8)(1362,9)s was a judgement from heaven to chastise her
partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor
confirmed(1605,10)(1144,14)(1263,9). Accordingly, a few months
after your departure for Ingolstadt,(500,13)called hom(1037,8)
repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she
was much altered since the death(973,11); grief had given softness
and a winning mildness to her(937,10)which had before been remarkable
for vivacity. Nor was her residence at(672,11)’s house of a nature
to restore her gaiety. The poor(635,11)very vacillating in(348,13)ce. She sometimes begged(1897,9)to for(1697,9)unkindness,
but much oftener accused her of having caused(369,10)(739,8)

into a decline(387,8)(1821,11)crea(150,8)irritability, but she is
now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,
at the beginning of this last winter.(1260,9)has just returned to us;
and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,
and extremely pretty; as I mentione(679,8), her mien(1310,8)
expression continually remind m(1796,8)dear aunt.

“I must say also a few words to you,(52,9)cousin, of little darling
William. I wish you could see him; (249,11)tall of his age, with
sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he

health. He has already had one or(95,12)_wives,_ but Louisa Biron
is his(1557,10), a pretty(318,8)girl of five years of age.

gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The(157,8)Miss Mansfield

sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your

“I have written myself into better(245,10)(1110,11); but my anxiety
returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest(804,8)—one line—one

“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”



“Dear, dear (63,9)!” I exclaimed, when I had read her
letter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the(453,9)they must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but
my convalescence had commenc(659,8)proceeded regularly. In another
fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.

On(1833,8)first duties on my recovery was to introduce(1024,9)to the
(1082,8)professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a
kind of rough usage, ill befitt(1490,8)wounds that my mind had
sustained. Ever (1208,10)fatal night, the end of my labours(416,8)e
beginning of my(1290,12), I had conceived a violent antipathy even
to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored
to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony
of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my
apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he
per(1865,9)at I had acquired a dislike for the room which had
previously been(440,8)ratory. But these cares(1693,12)were made of
no avail(1020,8)visited the(695,11). M. Waldman inflicted torture
when he praised, with (1334,8) and warm(435,8)astonishing progress I
had made in the sciences. He soon (307,17)disliked the
subject; but not gu(1516,8)he real cause, he attributed my feelings to
modesty, and(450,9)the subject(496,9)improvement, to(180,12)
itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What
could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he
had placed carefully, one by one, in(700,8) those(829,11)s which
were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I
writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.
Clerval, whose eyes and(444,10)were always quick in discerning the
sensations of others, declin(487,14), alleging, in excuse, his
total ignorance;(1320,8) conversation took a more general turn. I
thanked my friend(1093,9)heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly
that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from
me; and although I loved him(701,8)mixture of affection and reverence
that knew no boun(472,8)I could never persuade myself to confide in
him that event which was so often present to(1927,8)llection, but which
I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.

M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of
almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even
more pain than the benevolent approbation of(1450,11). “D—n
the fellow!” cried he; “why, M.(1560,8), I assure you he has
outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A
youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly
as(1573,8)gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if
he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,
ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,
“M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.
Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know(508,12): I was
myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”(825,12)had now commenced an eulogy on(417,8), which happily turned
(1354,17)from a(1920,9)that(1048,8)annoying to me.
(1574,8) ha(1141,8)sympathise(949,8)tastes for natural(1976,8); and his
literary pursuits differed wholly from those(199,9)d occupied me. He
came to(636,15) with the design of making(700,9)complete
master(704,8)oriental languages, and thus he(512,8)open a field for
the plan of life he had marked out for(826,8). Resolved to pursue no
inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording
scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit
(255,9) engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on
the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I
wished to f(536,8)ref(1690,9)and hated my former(113,8), I felt
great relief in being (1466,10)-pupil with my friend, and found not
only instruction but consolation(1332,8)works(594,16)ists. I
did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for
I did not contemplate(741,8)any other us(66,8)m than temporary
amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning(781,8)ey well
repaid my labours. Their melancholy is sooth(63,12)ir joy
elevating, to a degree I never experienced in study(439,8)authors of
(238,10)country. When you rea(195,8)writings, life appears to
consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns
of a fair enemy(299,9) fire that consumes your own heart. How
different(1274,8)e manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!

Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was
fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several
accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,
and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this
delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town(285,8)beloved
friends. M(305,9)had only been(259,9)so long, from an
unwillingness to leave (1858,8)in a strange place, befor(1597,9)become
acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent
cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came
its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.

The month of May had already commenced(1614,8)expected the letter daily
which was to fix the date of my departur(174,8)Henry proposed a
pedestrian tour(1450,8)environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a
personal farewell to the(1141,8) I ha(518,9)(410,8)ed. I acceded
with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and(570,8)
had always been my favourite compan(1678,11)ramble of this nature
that I had taken among the scenes of(794,11)(1370,8)

We(1121,9) fortnight(1128,10)perambulations: my health and spirits
had long been restor(520,8)they gained additional strength(1310,9)
salubrious air I breath(1120,8)natural incidents of our progress, and
the conversation of my friend. Study had(924,8)secluded me(139,10)intercours(658,8)fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but
(1046,8)called forth the better feeling(407,8)heart; he again taught
me to love the aspect of nature(1684,10)(1037,8) faces of children.
Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to
elevate my min(1457,8)it was on a level with(1804,9). A selfish
pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and
affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy (437,8)
who, a few years ago, loved and(1572,8) by all, had no sorrow or care.
When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most
delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with
ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
bloomed(1351,8)hedges, while those of summer were(1525,9)in bud. I
was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed
upon me, notwithstanding my(662,10)s to throw them off,(1870,8)
invincible burden.

Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and(784,11)sympathis(40,9)(941,8): he
exerted himself to amuse me(306,8)he expressed the(480,11) that filled
his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly
astonishing: his(1273,14)was full of imagination;(597,8)y often, in
imit(1327,9)the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful
fancy and passion. At other times he repeated(1773,14)poems, or drew
me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.

We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were
dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own(1825,8) were
high, and I bounded along with(1555,13)unbridled joy and hilarity.




Chapter 7


On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—

“My dear Victor,

“You have probably waited impatiently for a(87,8)to fix the date of
your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few
lines, merely mention(1088,8)day on which I should expect you. But
that would be a cruel kindness(395,8)dare not do it. W(54,12)
your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how,(408,8) can
I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to
our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent
son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is
impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words
which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.

my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!(443,9)he is murdered!

“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply(506,8)the
circumstances(1457,8)transaction.

“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to
walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged
our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of
returning; and then we discovered that (483,8)and Ernest, who had gone
on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until
they(1144,8)return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen
his(377,8); he said, that he had been playi(1577,8)him,(237,13)
had run away to hide himself, and(82,9)vainly sought for him, and
afterwards(1521,8)for a long time, but(156,9)did not(253,8)

“This account rather alarmed us(537,9)continued to search(137,8)

active in health, stretched(1744,8)grass livid and motionless; the

see the corpse. At first I(1459,8)ed to prevent her but she persisted,
and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the
victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I hav(363,8)ed my
darling child!’

“She fainted(679,10)restored with(625,9)difficulty. When she again
lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same

miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and
was doubtless the temptation which urged(707,11)er(1127,8)deed. We
have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to(1737,9) him
are unremitted; but they will(1168,9)ore my beloved(1787,8)!

“Alphonse Frankenstein.



“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”



Clerval, who had watched my (1616,12)as I read this letter, was
surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first
expressed on receiving news from my friends. I threw the letter on the
table, and covered my face with my hands.

“My dear(302,13),”(1619,10) Henry, when he perceived me
weep with bitterness, “are you always to be(998,8)? (114,8)friend,
what has happened?”

I motioned him to take up(239,11), while I walked up and down the
room in the(1737,8)st agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of(537,10)as he(507,8)e account of my misfortune.

“I can offer you no consolation,(454,10),” said he;
“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”

“To go instantly to Geneva: com(502,8)e,(461,8)to ord(985,9)rses.”

During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of(224,12);
he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor(1724,9)(274,9),
“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel(1499,9)Who that had
seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his
untimely loss! To die so(1534,9)y; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How
much more a(34,8)d that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little
fellow! one only(607,12) have we; his(1070,8) mo(1820,8)weep, but
he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer
be a subject for pity; we must re(1360,8)at for his(1913,10)
survivors.”(1484,9) spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words
im(1414,8)themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in
solitude. But now, as soon as(887,11) arrived, I(159,9)into a
cabriolet, and bade farewell to(1548,10).

My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed
t(1198,8)e and(937,8)is(1597,10)loved and sorrowing(1687,8); but when I
drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain
the multitude of feelings that crowd(314,8)my mind. I pass(496,10)
scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.
How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and
desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances
might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, alth(773,8)y were
done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I
dared no advance, dreading(207,12)nameless evils that made me tremble,
(168,9)I was unable to define them.

I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of(556,8)
contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the
snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By
(453,8)the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued m(1039,9)
towards Geneva.

The road ran by the side of(247,9), which became narrower as I
approached(983,15). I discovered more distinctly the black
sides of Jura,(310,8)(1953,8)summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a
child. “Dear(360,10)! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your
wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and
placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”

I fear,(1491,10), that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on
these preliminary(1065,14); but(1006,10) days of comparative
(149,9)(595,8)think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved
country! who but a(1532,8)can tell the delight I took in again
beholding thy streams, th(849,13)and, more than all, thy lovely
lake!

Yet, as I (1675,9)er home, grief and fear again(1224,12). Night also
closed around; and when(1711,17)ee the dark(1023,12)I felt still
more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I
foresaw obscurely(564,8)was destined to become the most wretched of human
beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single
(1682,12), that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not
conceive the hundredth part(1182,8)anguis(1550,8)(230,12)endure.

It was completely dark(432,8)arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates
of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at
Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky
was serene; and, as(1818,17)rest, I resolved to visit the spot
where my poor William had been murdered. As(740,9)not(221,8)rough the
town,(261,18)cross(1862,9) in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.
During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the(1587,15)
Blanc(482,8)most(1553,11)figures. The storm(886,10)to (1757,8)
rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill(1457,9)might observe its
progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded(1998,8)soon felt the rain
coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.

I quitted my seat, and walked on, alth(479,8) darkness and storm
(78,9) every minute(1990,10)thunder burst with a terrific crash
over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras(96,10)Alps of
Savoy; vivid flashes of(549,11)dazzled my eyes, illuminating the
lake, making it appear like(1411,8)sheet of fire; then for an instant
every thing seemed of a pitchy(324,9), until the eye recovered itself
(1011,9)preceding flash(684,11), as is often the case in
Switzerland,(1608,11)t once in various parts(1359,8)heavens. The
most violent storm hung exactly north(1417,8)town, over the(1444,12)
lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive(572,9)(1310,8)of
Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint(515,8); and another
darke(1650,8)sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked(1976,9) to the
eas(1663,9)lake.

While I watched the tempest, so(1135,11)yet(765,9), I wandered on with
a hasty step. This noble war(1701,8)sky eleva(952,8)pirits; I clasped my
hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy
funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perce(1869,11)
gloom a figur(515,8)stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood
fixed, gazing intently:(1675,13)be mistaken. A flash(1024,13)
(1007,9)ed the object, and dis(894,11) shape plainly to me; its
gigantic statur(1256,11)deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
to humanity,(1085,8)ly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I
shuddered at the conception) the(2048,8)r of my brother? No sooner did that
idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced(304,8)truth; my teeth
chatter(1794,10)was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure
passed m(1796,9)(1877,8)lost it(857,8)gloom. Nothing in human shape could
have destroyed the fair child. _He_(431,9)(312,8)!(682,12)
doubt it. The mere presence(1416,8)idea was an irresistible proof(1369,8)fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for
another flash(782,12)him to me hanging among the rock(1595,9)nearly
perpendicular ascent of Mont(1991,9)a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the
south. He soon rea(1373,9)summi(955,10)(1760,8).

I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still
continu(628,8)the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable(2006,9). I
revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:
the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of
the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had
now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and
was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a
depraved(1294,9)whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not
murdered(1232,12)

No one can conceive the anguish I suffered dur(872,8)remainder(921,8)night,(489,9)spent, cold and wet,(1996,8)open air. But I did not
feel the inconveni(1056,12)weather;(1380,15) was busy in
scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being(1602,12)cast
among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes
of horror, such as the deed(562,10)had now done,(619,8)in the light
(703,10)vampire,(719,8)spirit let loose from the grave, and forced
to(1469,8) a(1155,8)was dear to me.

Day dawned; and I directed my step(895,8)s the town. The gates were
open(1723,8)hastened to my father’s house. My first(1482,9)was to
(1416,8) what I knew(1571,8)(1940,8), and cause instant pursuit to be
made(607,8)paused when I reflected on the story that(906,8)o tell. A
(547,13)myself had form(1957,8)endu(541,8)life, had met me at
midnight(1605,11)precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I
remembered also the nervous fever with(1375,13)been seized just at
the time(231,8)dated my(1350,9), an(666,8)would give an air of
delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that
if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I sh(1991,9)
looked upon it(856,8)ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature
of the animal would elude all(588,8), even if I were so far credited
as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would
be(702,8)? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These(762,8)ions determined me, and
I resolved to remain silent.

It was about five(1485,8)morning(863,8)ent(1635,8)(1010,16)I
told the servants not to disturb the family, and went(1805,10)library
to attend their usual hour of rising.

Six(1998,10)(1987,8), passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I
stood(1728,8)same place where I had last embrac(257,12) before my
departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained
to me. I gaz(1227,10)picture of my mother(1939,8)stood over the
mantel-piece. (478,8)n historical subject, painted at(1481,12)
desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of(1939,8), kneeling
by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;
but there(210,8)air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
sentiment of pity. Below this(360,9)was a minia(376,8)William; and my
tears flow(1667,10)(1220,14). While I was thus engaged, Ernest
entered: he had heard me arri(2029,8)(1904,12)welcome me:
“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you
had come three months ago, a(1227,8)you w(1436,9) found us all joyous and
delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can
alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our fa(769,8)o seems
sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor
Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor
William! he was our darling and our pride!”

Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal
agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the
wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and
a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more
minutely concerning(1643,10)(1041,9)e I named my cousin.

“She most of all(766,8)Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused
herself of having caused the death of(404,11)(812,8)at made her
very (343,8). But since the murderer has been discovered—”

“T(37,12)(28,10)! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt
to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the
winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he
was free last night!”

“I do not know what you mean,” replied(363,13)in accents of
wonder, “but to us the(335,9)y we have made completes our misery. No
one would believe it at first; and even now (1050,10)will not be
convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit
that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of(96,9)family,
could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”

“(139,14)! Poor, poor girl, is she t(830,10)? But it is
wrongfully; every one knows that; no one(374,8)s it, surely(1815,8)?”

“No one did(406,11)but several circumstances came out(2044,9)ve
almost forced conviction upon us;(1111,8) own behaviou(931,11)so
confused, as to add to(477,13) of facts a weight that, I fear,
leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be(1324,9)day,(1718,8) will
then hear all.”

He then related that, the morning on which(1152,11) of poor William
had(1166,16),(654,9)(29,9)taken ill, and(1044,8)d to her
bed for(410,9)days. During this interval, one of the servants,
happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the
murder, had(1369,11) in her pocket the picture of my mother, which(269,10)judged to be the temptation(189,8)(1488,8). T(203,10)
instantly showed it to(245,12)others, who, without saying a word to
any(294,8)family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,
(1109,8)was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the(1009,10)
confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
manner.

This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I(1568,8)
earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know(429,15)Justine, poor,
good(20,10)is innocent.”

At that instant my father entered(1782,8)unhappiness deeply impressed
on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
some other topic than that of our disast(840,8)not Ernest exclaimed,
“Good God, papa! Victor says that h(1520,8)(1734,8)(816,12) of
(1154,12).”

“We do also, unfortunately,”(497,8)(382,10), “for indeed I had
rather have been for ever ignorant than have(1056,12)so much
depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”

“My dear(154,9)you are(646,11)(2010,8)(604,15)“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be
(1583,17)I hope, I sincerely hope,(90,10)(1643,8)acquitted.”

This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that(1133,8), and(412,8)every human being, w(203,8)less of this murder. I
had no fear, therefor(191,8)any(2038,11)tial(1924,10)could be
brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to
announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as
madness by the vulgar. Did any one(293,9)xist, except I, the
creator, who(100,9)lieve, unless his senses(410,11)him, in the
existenc(1904,9)living monument of presumption and rash(819,8)ce
which I had let loose(1647,9) world?

We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last
beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of
her childish years. There(1162,9)same candour,(18,10)vivacity, but
it was allied to an expression more full of sensibil(1087,8)intellect.
She(1495,8)d me(1897,10)greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear
cousin,” said she, “fills(81,9)hope. You perhaps will find some
means to justify my poor(907,11)Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she
be(828,8)ed of crime? I rely on her(1857,8)ce as certainly as I do
upo(1085,8). Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only
lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom(1299,12)
love,(1351,9) torn away by even a worse fate. (1452,9) condemned, I
never shall know joy more. Bu(1389,11)not, I am sure(24,13);
and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little
(1870,12)Sh(1647,13), m(908,11)(584,8)I, “an(1650,9)all
be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered(1253,8)assurance
of her(1635,8)al.”

“How kind and generous(1842,8)! every one else(1263,8)s in her guilt,
(179,9)made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to
see(111,16)prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me
hopeless and despairing.” She wept.

“Dearest niece(959,8)my father, “dry your tears(615,8)
is, as you(1524,10)(460,10)(876,8)the justice of our laws, and the
activity with (1482,8)shall prevent the slightest shadow of
partiality.”




Chapter 8


We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to
commence. M(275,8)(187,8) rest(1717,8)family being obliged to attend
as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. Dur(1587,8)whole of
this(583,9) mockery of(351,9)I suffered(1859,8)torture. It(208,8)be decided whether(203,8)ult of my curios(1575,8)lawless devices would
cause the(998,10)two of my fellow beings: one a smiling bab(1684,9)
(1415,11)nd joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every
aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised
to render her life happy; now al(604,8) be obliterated in an
ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I
have confessed myself guilty(689,8)crime ascribed to(1883,8), but I
was absent when(1192,8)committed, and such a declaration would have
been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have
exculpated her who(738,10)through me.

The appearance of(204,8) was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and
her countenance, always engaging, was(1376,9),(1614,8)solemnity of her
feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet s(178,9)ed confident in(786,15)did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by
(540,8)s, for all the kindnes(687,8)her beauty might otherwise(381,9)ited was(678,16)the minds(1277,8)spectators by the
imagin(914,9)the enormity she was supposed to have(603,10). She
was tranquil, yet her(18,9)lity was evidently constrained; and as
her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of(1992,11) she
worked up her mind to an(627,15)courage. When she entered the
court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were
seated. A tear seemed to dim(84,8) w(129,8)saw us, but she(95,8)
re(94,8)herself, and a look of sorrowful affection(108,11)attest
her utt(301,8)lessness.

T(1862,9)began, and after the advocate against her had stat(304,8)harge, several(1854,10) were called. Several strange facts combined
(97,11), which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof
of her (1708,11)s I had. She had been out(1971,13) the night on
which(1669,12)(56,9)(1363,9) and towards morning(95,9)
perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the bod(1530,8)
(1859,8) child(191,10)afterwards found. The woman ask(1414,9)at she
did there(608,10)looked very(402,8)ly and only returned a confused
and unintelligible answer. She(51,10)to the house about eight
o’clock, and when one inqui(831,10)she had passed(408,10), she
replied that(43,9)been looking for the child and demanded earnestly
if anyth(437,12) heard concerning him(1059,9)own(414,9), she
fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for(800,9)days. The
picture was then produced (642,10)servant had found in her pocket;
(333,9)Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, prov(316,8)it(118,8) same
which, an hour(1402,8)(329,10)(826,9)missed,(424,10)laced round
his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.

Justine was called on for her defence. As t(1208,9)had proceeded, her
countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly
expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but(1489,10)was
desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible
although variable voice.

“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am(1294,8)t. But I
do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my(1375,10)
on a plain and simple explanation(1372,8)facts which hav(2005,14)(1533,9)me, and I hop(639,8)aracter I have always borne will incline my
judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears
doubtful or suspicious.”

She then related that, by the permission of(911,12)(1236,14)
the evening(1659,16)(1017,11)(1659,27)t the
house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from
Geneva. On her return,(46,10)nine (1465,9)she met a man who asked
her if(1468,9)seen(1377,10)of(1425,11)who was lost. She was
alarmed by this account an(1545,9)(1342,8)hours i(1521,14)him,
when the gates of Geneva were shut, and(926,8) forced to remain
(99,14)(410,13)in a barn belonging to a cottage, being
unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom(138,9)well known. Most
(534,13)she spent here watching; towards morning she belie(1510,8)
she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her(294,10)awoke.
It was dawn(322,10)quit(1220,8)asylum,(1942,10)might again endeavour
to find my brother. I(566,10)gone near the spot where his body lay,
it was without her knowledge. T(131,8)(2007,9)bewildered when
question(623,8)e market-woman was not surprising, since(966,16)a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.
Concerning the picture she could give no(783,8).

“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and
fatally this one(1274,14)weighs (1415,12)but(1394,8)no power of
explaining it; and when(1437,8)(1846,9) my utter ignorance, I am only left
to conjecture c(270,15)robabilities by which it might(1605,10)
placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I(806,8) tha(230,11)
enemy on earth, and none surely would(1727,11)so wicked as to destroy me
wantonly. Did(1488,11)er place it there? I know of no opportunity
afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why(1968,8)he have stolen the
jewel, to part with i(926,8)so soon?

“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for
hope. I beg(1808,12)to have a few witnesses examined(510,12)my
(2037,9), and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my
innocence.”

Several(191,11)were called who had known her for many years, and
they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred(1849,9)rime of which they
(232,8) her guilty rendered them timorous and (1687,14)ome
forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,
when(396,11)violently agitated, she desired(589,15)address
the court.

“I am,” said she, “the cousin(1999,8)(1321,8)child who
was(924,8)d, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived
with his parents ever since and even long befo(1752,8)irth. It may
therefore be judged indecent in me(449,8) forward on this occasion, but
when I see a fellow creature(405,10)perish through the cowardice of her
pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak,(1365,8)may say what I
(1252,8)her (991,9). I am well acquainted with(557,12).(1674,8)lived
in the same house with her, at one time for five and at anot(920,8)nearly
two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and
benevolent of human(370,9)s. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in
her last illness,(273,10)greatest affection and care and afterwards
attended her own mother during a tedious(102,10)in a manner that excited
the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again liv(1947,8)
uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was
warmly attached(1694,8)(970,9) is now dead and acted towards him like a
mo(322,12)ate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,
notwithstand(574,10)e evidence produced against her, I believe and rely
on her perfect (1657,10) She had no temptation for such an action; as to
the bauble on(1589,10) chief proof rests, if she had earnestly(1394,9)it,
I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value
her.”

A murmur of approb(204,8)llowed(1677,10)’s simple and powerful
appeal, but it was(676,8) by her generous interference, and not in
favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with
renewed violence, charging her(1219,10)blackest ingratitude. She
herself wept as(1930,12)poke, but she did not answer. My own
agita(1027,9)anguish was extreme(1003,8)the whole trial.(639,10)d
in her(623,10); I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I(148,9)for a
minute doubt)(1870,9) my brother also in his hellish sport have
betrayed the(764,8)t to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the
horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and
the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,
I rushed out(68,8)court in agony. The tortur(104,10)accused did
not equal mine;(1328,9)sustained by(1069,10), but the fangs of
remorse tore my bosom and w(325,9)forgo their hold.

I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went(1162,8)court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal
question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my
visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and(1058,8)
was(496,10).

I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before
experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon
them adequate expressions, but words(167,8)convey an idea of the
heart-sickening despair t(193,11)endured. The person to whom I
addressed myself add(865,8)Justine(820,16)fessed her guilt.
“That(1847,9),” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a
case(548,8)am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our(979,8)like to
condemn a criminal upon circumstantial(167,10) be it ever so
decisive.”

This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had
my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as(1515,11)world would
believe me to be if I disclo(815,8)object(1341,8)uspicions? I
hastened to return home, an(1971,11) eagerly demanded the result.

“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have (304,8); all
(1410,11)rather that ten(1589,10)should suffer than that one guilty
should escape. But she has(669,10)(452,13)a dire blow to poor(1967,10),(1816,9)relied with firmness upon
Justine’s(1898,10). “Alas!” said she. “How shall I
ever again(1967,8) in human goodness?(1182,8), whom I loved and esteemed as
my sister, how could she put on those smiles of(1618,10) only to betray?
Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and ye(362,9)
committed a murder.”

Soon after we hear(1963,13)or victim had(1264,8)ed a desire to see my
cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own
judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” sai(785,11),
“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany
me; (1643,9)go alone.” The(1481,11)is visit was torture to me, yet
I c(2031,9)refuse.

We entered the gloomy prison chamber and behel(1802,9) sitting on some
straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on
her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with
her, she threw herself(164,9)eet of(964,13)eeping bitterly. M(580,8) wept also.

“Oh,(1751,8)(956,14)Why did you rob me of my last consolation?
I(1067,8)on your(1046,10), and(557,10)I was then very wretched, I
was not so miserable as I am now.”

“And do you also(1098,9)that I am so very, very wicked? D(52,10)
join with my enemies to crush me, to (1851,8)me as(979,9)er?” Her
voice was suffocat(1321,8)sobs.

“Rise, my poor girl(850,17); “why(208,8)kneel,
if you are(1540,9)?(260,8)t one of your(187,8), I(1361,8)d you
guiltless, notwithstanding every(2032,11)until I(1177,12)you had
yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be
assured, dear(1500,10)that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a
moment, but your own(1757,8)ion.”

“I did(1778,8), but I(1793,10) a lie.(19,12),(567,8)might
obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than
all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was
condemned,(276,8)essor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,
(475,8)almost began to think(816,8)was the monster(1589,9)said I
was. H(100,13)excommunication and hell fire in(1057,9)moments if
I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked
o(909,10)wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?
In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly
(1177,9).”

She paused(1391,9), and then(243,10), “I thought with horror, my
sweet lady,(895,10)should(1244,9)you(828,11)whom your blessed
aunt had so highly honour(1689,8)(51,8) loved, was a creature capable
of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
Dear William! dearest(170,8) child! I soon shall see you again in
heaven, where we shall all be happy; and tha(1672,8)es me, going as I
am to suffer(543,14)death.”(1787,15) F(913,9) for having for one moment distrusted you.
(1828,12)confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I
will proclaim, I (17,8)(504,8)(1866,9).(29,8)melt the stony
hearts(1557,16) by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!
You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!
No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”

Justine shook her head mournfully. “I(338,8)fear to die,” she said;
“that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to
endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember
me and think of me as of one unjustly (1506,11)I am resigned to the
fate awaiting me. Learn from me, d(1342,10)to submit in patience to
the will(1655,10)!”

During this conversation I had retir(1293,8)corner of the prison room,
where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!
Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who(627,8)morrow was to pass
the awful boundary between life(1015,10), felt not, as I did, such
deep(483,12)agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,
uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.(1493,8) started. When
she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very
kind to visit me; you, I hope,(1187,8)(1638,8)that I am guilty?”

(478,8)not answer. “No(1334,9),” said Elizabeth; “he is more
convinced(1182,9)(1230,9) than I was, for even when he heard(1808,9)
had(1374,8)ed, he did not credit it.”

“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest
gratitude towards those who(974,13)with kindness. How sweet is
the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than
half my(1320,11), and(184,8)as if(891,9)die in peace now that my
(365,10)is acknowledged by you(1093,13)and your cousin.”

Thus t(906,8)sufferer tried to comfort(228,8)and herself. She indeed
gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the
never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or
consolation.(689,10) also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was
the misery of(1947,10), which, like a cloud that passes over the fair
moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and
despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within
me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with(1983,8), and it was with great difficulty that(379,11)could tear
herself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I
cannot (533,8)this world of misery.”
(174,8) assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with(198,11)
repressed her(1582,8)tears. She embrace(1302,11)(1452,9) in a voice
of half-sup(80,8)emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, deares(323,11),
my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and
preserve you; may this be th(1334,8)(1158,9)(1427,9) will ever
suffer! Live, and be happy, and make(1287,8)so.”

And(1996,15)(1800,8)died(925,11)’s heart-rending eloquence
failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the
criminality of the saintly(1256,9). My passionate and indignant
appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers
and(1770,9)e harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed
avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,
but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She
perishe(468,9)scaffold as a(1482,8)ss!

From the tortures of my own heart, I turn(1632,8)ntemplate the deep and
voiceless grief of my(1492,10). Thi(1462,10) my doing! And my
father’s woe, and the de(1568,8) of that late so smiling home all(1549,9)work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep,(1623,8) ones, but these
are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and
the sound of(74,8)mentations shall again and again be heard!
Frankenstein, your so(10,8)kinsma(24,8)early, much-loved(1135,9)he
who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no
thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear
countenanc(93,8)would fill the air with blessings an(182,8)his life
in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond
his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if(661,8)truction
pause before the peace(1216,8)grave have succeeded to(359,8)d torments!

Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,
I beheld those I love(509,8)vain sorrow(1309,9) graves of William and(1941,8), the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.




Chapter 9


Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have
been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of
inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope
and fear.(1833,13), she rest(564,8)I was alive. The(877,8)lowed
freely in my veins, but a weight of(474,8) and(507,8) pressed on my
heart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered
like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief(853,8)description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet
behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness(1579,9)love of virtue.
I had begun life with benevolent intention(68,8)irsted for the moment
when I should put them in practice and make(1992,8)useful to my fellow
beings. Now(1710,8) blasted; instead(1764,9)serenity of conscience
which (877,8)me to look back(976,10)past with self-satisfaction, and
from thence to gather promise of new(1310,8)I was seized(1149,11)(1762,10)(1551,8)guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures
such as no language can describe.

This state of mind preyed upon my health(129,9)ad perhaps never
entirely recover(779,8)(1247,10)shock it had sustained. I shunned
the face of man; all(2020,10)joy or complacency was(231,8) to me;
solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike (55,8).

My father observ(787,8)pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition
and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduc(305,13)(1433,8)of his
serene(684,11) and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and
awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.
“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer
also? No one could love a child more than(1878,9)your
brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but
is it not a duty(1804,8)survivors that we(1144,8)refrain from augmenting
their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty
owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,
or even the discharge of daily usefulness, withou(1724,10) man is fit for
society.”

This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I
should have been(1020,11)to hide my grief and console my friends if
(1924,8)had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my
other sensations. Now I could only answer m(1007,9)with a look of
despair(955,14)(202,11)self from his view.

About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was
particularly agree(365,9)e. The shutting of the gates reg(53,8)t
ten o’clock(1988,9)impossibility of remaining on the lake after that
hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome
to me. I was now free. Often,(113,9)e rest(213,8)family had
(323,8)for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours(1977,9)
water. Sometimes(558,9) sails set(1937,8)carried by the wind; and
s(61,10)after rowing into the middle(409,8)lake, I left(168,10)to
pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I
was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only
unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and
heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and
interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,
I say(444,8)tempted to plunge(413,10)silent lake, that the waters
might close(1771,8) and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,
when I though(716,9)heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly
loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.(114,11)also of my
father and surviving brother;(1787,8)I by my base desertion leave them
exposed and unprotected(1877,8)malic(754,9)fiend(208,8)had let loose
among them?

At these moments I wept bitterly and wished th(713,9)would revisit my
mind only that I might afford them consolation and (1997,9). But that
could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had(1765,10)author of
unalterable evils(881,8)lived in daily fear lest the monster(311,11)
created(422,8)perpetrate some new wickedness(145,8)an obscure feeling
that(1040,9)not over and that h(339,8)still commit some signal crime,
which by its enormity(580,8)almost efface the recollection(1702,8)past.
There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained
behind. My abhorren(643,8)is fiend cannot be conceived. W(927,16)
him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflam(917,8)I ardently(676,9)o
(558,10) that life which I had so(1048,8)lessly bestow(152,10)
reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds
of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage(972,8)highest peak of the
Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished
to see him again,(948,14)wreak the utmost extent of(485,13)n his
head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.

Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply
shaken by the horror(2029,8)recent events.(1503,10) was sad and
desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward(280,8)d; eternal woe and tears she
then(1714,9)(283,8)just tribute she(1162,9)ay to innocence so blasted
and destroyed. She was(228,12)hat happy creature who in earlier youth
wandered with me on the banks(1878,8)lake and talk(44,8)ecstasy of our
future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from
the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest
smiles.

“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of
Justine Moritz, I(600,11)see the world(169,9)works as they before
appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and
injustice(1932,8)read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient
days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to
reason than(1249,8)imagination; but now misery has come home, and men
appear to me as(1965,8)s thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am
certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and
if she c(1481,10)committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly
s(2038,9)have been the most depraved of human(938,9)s. For the sake
of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,
a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and (678,12)love as if
it had been her own! I could not con(983,8)(1582,9) of any human
being, but (434,10)I(1274,8)have(1319,9)such a(1222,10)unfit to
remain in the society of men. But she was(1347,8)t. I know, I feel
(33,16); you are(1642,8)same opinion, and that confirms me.
Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can
assure themselves of(279,8) happiness? I feel as if I were walking on
the edge of a precipice, toward(1397,8)thousands are crowding and
endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.(2039,20) were
assassinated(305,8)(680,9)r escapes; he walks about(1335,11)free,
and perhaps respected. But even(257,11)condemned to suffer on the
scaffold f(845,9)me crimes, I w(689,10)hange places with such a
wretch.”

I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,
but in effect, was(531,8)(295,10). Elizabeth read my anguish in my
countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My(1809,8)(1036,8) you
must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how
deeply; but I am not so wretched as(850,8). There is an expression of
despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your (249,11) that makes me
tremble. Dear(911,9)banish these dark passions. Remember the
friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost
the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, w(15,8)are
true to(1764,11), here in this land of peace and beauty, your native
country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our
peace?”

And(1498,11)such words from her whom I fondly prized before every
other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fie(1386,8)lurked in my
heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at
that very moment the destroyer(1755,10)(78,8)rob me of her.

Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of
heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were
ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial
influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting
limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had
pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.

S(1058,9)I could cop(1412,11)sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but
(1130,10)the whirlwind(1058,9) of(401,9)drove me to seek, by bodily
exercise and by(1614,8)of place, some relief from my intolerable
sensations. It was during an access of this ki(795,8)I suddenly left
my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought
in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and
my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed
(177,12)valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently(319,8)my
boyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought
had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.

I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards
hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive
injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the
middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of
Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The
weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in
the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices(1095,10)hung
me on every side, the sound(297,8)river raging among the rocks, and
the dashing(350,8)waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as
Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to ben(1937,9)any being less
almighty than that(1431,10) crea(609,8)ruled the elements, here
display(792,8)eir most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,
(996,11)assumed a mor(1160,12)t and astonishing character.
Ruined castles hanging on the(454,12)of piny(487,10), the
impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from
(484,10)trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was
augmen(368,9)endered sublime by the(509,8)Alps, whose white and
shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another
earth, the habitat(1805,8)another race of beings.

I(1360,8)the bridge of Pélissier, where (893,10), which(809,10)
forms, opene(687,9)(1743,8)I began to ascend th(940,10) that
overhangs it. Soon after, I entered(1613,26)This
valley is more wonderful an(393,9)(1559,8)t so beautiful and
picturesque a(1073,8)f Servox, through(1256,9)had just passed. The
high and snow(679,11) were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no
more r(787,14)and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached
the road; I heard the rumbling thunder(1557,8)falling avalanche and
marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the suprem(61,8)(1018,10)(40,12)raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,
and its tremendous _dôme_ overloo(163,8)valley.

A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this
journey. Some turn in (345,8), some new object suddenly perceived and
recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing
accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the
kindly influence(1714,11)act—I found myself fettered(65,8)o grief
and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my
animal, striving so to forget the world, my fear(246,8)ore than all,
myself—or, in(1717,8)desperate fashion, I aligh(1871,8)threw(230,8)on
the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.

At length I arrived at the village(1248,15)Exhaustion succeeded
to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind(1210,13)endured.
For a short space of time I remain(156,10)window watching the pallid
lightnings that play(1712,9)(1064,10) and listening to the rushing of
the Arv(1633,9)pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds
acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head
upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed
the giver of oblivion.




Chapter 10


I spent the following day roaming(1665,9)(1261,11) I stood beside
the sources(1499,8)Arveiron(1970,9)ake their rise in a(1602,8), that
with slow pace is advancing down(1462,12)mmit(1606,8)hills to
barricade(172,13)The abrupt sides of vast(1830,16)before
me; the icy wall(1708,8)glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
sc(21,8)around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
presence-chamber of imperi(1334,10)was broken only by the brawling
waves or(1895,9) of some vast fragment, the(1942,9)sound of the
(1940,10)or the cracking, reverberated along the(336,10),(68,9)ccumulated ic(861,8),(595,13)silent working of immutable laws,
was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the
greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me
from all littleness of feeling, and alth(885,8)y did not remove my
grief, they subdu(1569,8)ranquillised it. In some degree, also, they
diverted my mind(864,10)thoughts over which(351,9)rooded for the
last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
waited on and ministered to(726,8)assemblance of grand shapes(1629,8)
had contemplated dur(1580,8)day. They congregated round me; the
unstained snowy(1053,9)-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,
and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all
gather(164,11) and bade me be at peace.

Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of
soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every
thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the
summit(1593,9)(1094,11)so(863,8)even saw not the fa(1644,9)ose
mighty friends. Still I would penetrat(1665,8)misty veil and seek them
in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was
brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend(38,8)(1747,9)
Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view(1907,8)tremendous
and ever-moving(1725,9)had produced upon(1020,9)when I first saw it.
It(601,8)n filled me with a(1342,9)ecstasy that gave wings to the
soul and allowed it to soar(2001,10)obscure world to light and joy.
The sigh(2036,9)awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the
effect of solemnising(1276,9)and causing me to forget the passing
cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well
acquaint(873,8)the path(799,8)e (2046,8) of another would destroy the
solitary grandeur(831,8)scene.

The ascent is precipitous, bu(214,8)th is cut into continual and short
windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the
(1355,8). It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots
the tr(1012,10)e winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie
broke(956,8)rewed on the ground, some entirely(368,8)ed, others bent,
leaning upon the jutting rock(1224,17) or transversely upon
other trees. T(517,10)s you(1051,8)higher, is intersected by ravines
of snow, down which stones(461,10)ly roll from above; one of them is
particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking
in a loud voice,(1130,8)s a concussion of air sufficient to draw
destruction(349,10)head(733,9)peaker. The pines are not tall or
luxuriant(744,9)y are sombre and add an air of severity(1417,9)cene.
I look(547,10)valley beneath; vast mists were rising(1234,10)rivers
which ran through it and curl(1827,8)hick wreaths around the opposit(834,10)s, whos(1582,8)s were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
poured(1395,10)dark sky(275,8)e(1675,9)(2029,11)impression I
receiv(68,12)object(180,9)me. Alas! Why does man boast of
sensibilities superior to those apparent(206,8)brute; it only renders
them more necessary beings. If our impulses were conf(1444,8)hunger,
thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by
every wind that blows and a chance word or(1267,8)hat that word may
convey to us.

  We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
     We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.
  We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
     Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
  It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,
    (1279,9) of its departure still is free.
  Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;
     Nought may endure but mutability!


It was(500,8)noon when I arrived at the top(1897,8)ascent. For some
time I sat(1562,10)rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered
both that and the surrounding(1622,9)s. Presently a breeze dissipated
the cloud, and I descended(1720,10)glaci(1359,8)surface is very
uneven,(1241,8)like the waves of a troubled sea,(97,8)ing low, and
interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a
league in width, but I spent(934,8)two hours in crossing it. The
(1351,8)(1939,10)is a bare perpendicular rock. F(1476,8)side where I
now stood Montanvert was exactly(1454,9),(557,8)distance of a league;
and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess
of(609,9), gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,
or rather the vast river of ice, wound among(923,8)endent(649,10),
whose aerial(1690,9)hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering
peaks shone(1742,8)sunlight over (722,9)s. My heart, which was
before sorrowful, now swelled with someth(719,9)joy; I exclaimed,
“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow
beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,
away(1967,10)joys of life.”

As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at som(667,10),
advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded(402,9)
crevices(1972,8)ice, among which I had walk(390,8)caution; his
stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was
(1161,8); a mist came over my eyes(1286,8)felt a faintness seize me,
but I was quickly restored by the cold gale(1540,8)(1422,11)I
perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)
that it was the wretch whom I had created. I tremb(733,9)rage and
horror, resolving to wait his(348,9)(1631,8)n close with him in
mortal combat. H(402,12); his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
combin(892,8)disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
rendered it(1553,8)too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely
observed this;(289,9) hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,
and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
detestation and contempt.

“Devil,”(1164,13) “do you dar(786,10) me? And do
not you fear the fierce venge(1657,8)my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
Begone, vile insect! O(1567,8), stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,
oh! That I could, with the extinction of(137,16)existence,(889,8)
those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”

“I expected this reception,”(1333,8)e dæmon. “All men hate the
wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am(330,11)beyond all
living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,
to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble(1191,8)annihilation of
one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?
Do your duty(1580,11)(1369,8)will do mine(1611,9)you(1127,8) rest of
mankind. If you will comply with my conditions,(91,8)leave them and
you at peace; but if you refuse(55,9)glut the maw of death, until it
be satiat(1693,8)the blood(674,9)remaining friends.”

“Abhorred monster! Fiend that(432,9)! The tortures of hell are too
mild a(944,11)for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You re(1034,9) with
your creation, come on(695,8)(947,11)extinguish the spark(1957,8)
so negligently bestowed.”

My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the
feelings which can arm one being against th(1031,11) of another.

He easily eluded me and said,

“Be calm! I entreat(1179,8)hear me before you give vent to your hatred
on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to
increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumu(945,10)(1858,8) is dear to(874,17)efend it. Remember, thou hast made
me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
joints more supple(1892,8)will not be tempted to set myself in
opposition to thee. I am(1254,14)(1089,12)be even mild and
docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,
the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every
other and(1789,9)upon me alone, (1455,10)y justice, and even thy
clemency and affection, is most due(465,10)(1903,8)(305,15);
I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel,(1614,10)
drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from(1078,9)alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery(681,9)a fiend. Make me happy(1629,8)shall again be virtuous.”

“Begone!(660,12)hear you. There can be no community between you
and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,
in which one must fall.”

“How can I move thee? Will no(1200,8)ies cause thee to turn a
favourable eye upon(834,15)who implores thy goodness and
compassion? Believe me(760,16)(428,16); my soul glowed
with love and humanity; but am I not(778,8)miserably alone? You, my
creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow(1073,9)s,
who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and
dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the
caves of ice,(1867,8) only do not fear, are a dwelling(1487,12)the
only on(1186,8)man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they
are kinder to me than(322,13)beings. If the multitude of mankind
knew of my(1930,10), they would do as you do, and arm themselves for
my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who(525,9)?(1759,8)keep
no terms with my(921,10)I am(612,9)(330,10)y shall share my
wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense(1897,9)deliver
them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that
not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be
swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your (1018,10) be
moved, and(670,8)disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard
that, abandon or commiserate me,(541,8)shall judge(1736,8)deserve.
But hear(928,9)guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as(749,9), to speak in their own defence before they are condemned(236,8)
to(1288,17). You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with
a satisfied conscience, destroy your own(1985,9). Oh, praise the
eternal justic(911,8)! Yet I ask you not to spare me; l(434,10)e,
and then, if you can, and(16,8)will(150,10)the work of your hands.”

“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of
(1290,8)shudd(866,8)flect,(525,8)have been the(972,10) origin and
author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, (1915,9)you first saw
light!(65,8)(although I curse myself)(91,8)hands that formed you!
Y(770,8)made me (1111,8) beyond expression. (45,9)left me no power
to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! R(1968,9) from
the sight(440,9)detested form.”

“Thus I relieve thee, my (1916,8)” he said, and placed his hated hands
before my eyes(1758,10)flung from me with violence; “thus I tak(177,10)e a sight(420,11)abhor. Still thou canst(724,13) and grant
me thy(1232,11). By the virtues(1124,8)once possessed, I demand this
from you. Hear(1257,10)it is long and strang(1954,10) temperature of
this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon
the mountain. The sun is yet high(1513,8)heavens;(1236,8)it descends
to hide itself behi(1630,8)snowy precipices and illuminate another
world,(1061,9)(1519,11) my story and can decide. On you it rests,
(723,10)quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless
life, or become the scourge(1193,9)fellow(1358,9)s(422,9)author of
(1395,9)speedy ruin.”

As(763,8) this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart
was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the
various arguments that he had used and determined at least to(1530,10)
his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and(833,11) confirmed my
resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to(1415,8)murderer of my
broth(1830,8)I eagerly sought a(110,8)ation or denial of this opinion.
For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a(1242,8) towards
his(1902,9) wer(971,9)at I ought to render him happy(863,8)I
complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with
his demand. We crossed(606,8), therefo(157,8)ascended the opposite
rock. The air was cold(1178,10)rain again began to(1051,8); we
entered(1144,8), the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy
heart and depressed spirits. But I consented(671,10), and seating
myself by(479,8)e which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began(753,10)




Chapter 11


“It is with(1898,9)able difficulty(1575,8)remember the original era of

A(1609,8) multiplicity of(1562,11) seized me(1104,8)saw, felt, heard,

was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled
me, but hardly had(1062,8)this when, by opening(97,8), as I now
suppose, the(188,8)oured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,
descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my(520,11).
Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my
touch or sight; but I now fou(1280,10)could wander on at liberty, with
no obstacles which(54,9)not either surmount or avoid. T(326,8)
became more and more oppressive to(755,9)the heat wearying me as I
walked, I(1608,10)place where(202,9)receive shade. This was the
forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay(1175,8)side of a brook resting
from my fatigue, until(621,9)ormented by hunger and thirst. This
roused me (77,8)nearly dormant stat(1029,9)ate some berri(390,10)

were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted
your apartment, on a(1374,10) of cold, I had covered(95,8)with some
clothes, but these were insufficient to secure(453,9)the dews of
night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could

down and wept.

“Soon a gentl(1252,8)stole over(894,8)vens and gave me(327,15)

day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to(666,11)and to
(575,9)objects in their right forms; I(1059,12)ed the insect from
the herb, and by degrees, one herb from an(1095,9)found that the
sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst thos(1693,9)blackbird and
thrush were sweet and enticing.

I thought,(406,9) same cause should produce such opposite effects! I
examined the material(1355,9)fire,(1212,8)my joy found it to be
composed of wood. I(215,9)collected some branches(1078,9)y were wet

dried an(1066,8)(922,8)inflamed. I reflected on this(841,9)touching
the various(248,11)I(1790,14)(429,8)and busied myself in
collecting a great quantity(364,8), that I might dry it and have a
plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with
it, I wa(1133,8) greatest fear lest my fir(630,9)be ex(1152,10). I

into sleep.

“It was morning(1125,8)awoke(1486,9)first care was to visit(611,10)

“Food, however,(1236,8)scarce, and I often spent the whole day
searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When

inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants(1961,15)would be
more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the
los(1829,13)(1624,13)obtained through accident and knew not how
to re(1957,8)it. I gave several hours to the serious consid(1772,10)

towards the setting sun. I passed three day(1614,8)se rambles and at

shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which
had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This
was a new sight to m(1129,9)examined the structure with great
curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,
near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on
hearing a noise, and(337,8)ing me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the
hut, ran(816,12)(643,8)ith a speed of(164,8)is debilitated form

before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. B(1102,9)enchanted

penetrate;(774,11) was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite
and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium(306,10)to the dæmons of hell
after their suffering(1183,8) lake of fire. I greedily devoured the
remnant(1555,9)(782,8)’(603,11), which consisted of bread, cheese,
milk, and wine; the latter(1981,11)I did not like. Then, overcome by
fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep(1155,11)noon when I awoke, and allur(1247,10)warmth(242,9)un(1088,8)shone brightly on the whit(1263,8), I determin(1692,8)commence my

at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did th(916,9)! The
huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by
turns. The vegetable(683,9)gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw
placed at the windows(1481,9)of the(160,12)llured my appetite. One
of the best of these(1432,10), but I had hardly placed my foot within
(1497,9)before the children(1373,9), and on(1127,9)women fainted.
The whole(407,8) was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,
grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I
escap(1133,10)open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,
quite bare, and making a wretched(1402,12)(1218,9) palaces I had
beheld(1226,8)(688,9)This hovel(1108,10)joined a(664,8) of a neat
and pleasant(1640,13)but after my late dearly bought experience, I
dared not enter it. My place of(265,8)was constructed of wood, but so
low(716,8)could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood(1347,10)

although(839,9)(763,8) it by innumerable chinks,(1166,8) it an
agreeable asylum from(1848,18).

“Here, then, I(1770,8)ed and(1508,10)happy to have found a shelter,
however miserable,(113,10)inclemency(1732,9)eason(1184,8)ill more

kennel,(1174,8)might view the adjacent(653,9)and discover if(508,8)
remain(1963,8)habitation I had found. It was situated against the back(1225,8)(110,12)surround(545,10)sides which were exposed by a pig
sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by(1436,8)had
crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which(319,9)be perceived
with(1213,12)wood, yet in such a manner(388,14)move them on
occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came thr(787,9)sty, and
that was sufficient for me.

“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I
retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered
too well my treatment the night(1699,9)o trust myself in his power. I
had first(1139,10) provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf
of coarse bread(1181,8)I purloin(1814,8)a cup with(530,9)could drink

“Be(574,9)(355,8), I resolved to reside in t(1787,10)until
something should occu(254,8)might alter my determination(1111,8)

the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with
pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure(704,8)(451,8)
(508,8)en I heard a step, and looking(998,9)a small chink, I beheld
a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing(858,8)my hovel. The
girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike w(1352,8)ve since found
cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a
(908,8)lue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair
hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost
sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing
the pail(1113,8)was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,
seemingly incommoded by the burden, (528,8)man met her, whose
coun(1288,8)expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with
an air of melancholy, he took (234,8) from(637,9) and bore it to the(555,8) himself. She follow(1391,8)they disappeared. Presently I saw
the(241,11)again, with some tools(1588,8)hand, cross the field
behind(1281,12);(124,8) (789,9)also busied, sometimes in the
house and(27,17) yard.

“On examining(1906,12), I found that one(1569,8)windows of(302,14)ad formerly occupi(1299,8)t of it, but the panes had been
filled (1729,9)ood. In(117,11)se was(1132,9)and almost
imperceptible chink(1179,9)which the eye could just penetrate.
Through this crevice(1236,9)room was visible, whitewashed and clean
but very bare of furniture(200,9)corner, near(1332,9)fire, sat an
old man, leaning his head o(551,10)s in a disconsolate attitude. The

and to produce(1008,8)sweeter than the voic(674,9)thrush or the
nightingale(1969,8) a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had
never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent(1254,13)of the aged(989,8)r won my reverence, while the gentle
manner(892,8) girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air
which I perceived drew tears from(818,8)s of his amiable companion, of

pronounced(1488,13)(1381,9) fair creature, leav(1881,8)work, knelt
at his feet. He raised her and smi(1735,9)such kindness and affection
that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had (605,8)fore experienced,

pleased and went(185,10)garden for some roots and plants(1385,8)she

work, whilst(481,15)(155,21)and appeared busily

thus about an hour,(625,11)woman joined him(1039,8)y entered the

from those(880,8)used(766,9)orning, directed his steps across the
fields.

Chapter 12


“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought(237,8)occurrence(336,9)day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners
of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I
remembered too well the treatment I had suff(2039,8) night(1766,8)from
the barbarous villag(1093,9)resolved, whatever course of conduct I
might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would

went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause(949,8)ir unhappiness,
but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were
miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,
should be wretched. Yet why were thes(1408,9)beings unhappy? They
possessed a delightful house (for such(167,8)in my eyes) and every
luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands
when hung(74,9)were dre(1026,8)excellent clothes; and, still more,
they enjoyed one another’(523,8)y and speech, interchanging each day
looks(712,18)kindness. What di(1941,8)tears imply? Did they
really express pain? I was at first unable to solv(433,8)questions,
but perpetual atten(856,9)time explained to me many appearanc(1554,8)
were(119,10)enigmatic.

“A considerable period elapsed(1846,8)I(1647,9)ed one(2048,8)causes of
the uneasiness of this amiable family:(753,8)poverty(1566,9)y

consisted(1054,10)of the vegetables of their garden(1695,9)milk of
one cow, which gave (1254,12)during the winter, when its masters
could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,(270,12)e pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two(1524,18), for several times they placed foo(494,9)the old

consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on

roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.

their labours.(255,14)the youth spent a great(345,9)(1279,9)in collect(161,8)(1800,8) family fire, and(782,12)night I often
took his tools, the use of(280,9)quickly(1114,11), and brought home
firing sufficient(140,9)(498,11) of(730,9)days.

“I remember, the first tim(1889,8) did this,(283,8)ng woman, when she
opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing(363,8)
pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice(1330,9)

that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repai(1297,8)
cottage and cultivat(1325,8)garden.

“By degrees I made a(1630,9)y of still greater moment(717,14)
these people possessed a method of communic(131,9)ir experience and
feelings to one(883,9)by articulate sounds. I perceiv(1701,8)the words
they spoke sometimes produced(362,9) or pain, smiles or sadness, in the
minds and countenanc(1718,9) hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,
and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in
every attempt(436,8)for this purpos(1937,9)pronunciation was quick, and
(306,9) they(751,8), not having any apparent connection with visible
objects, I was unable to(1349,9) any clue by(1417,9)could unravel the

and his companion had each of them(1482,9)names, but the old man had only
one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or
_Agatha,_(1356,8) youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot
describe the delight I felt when(356,11)the ideas appropriated to(240,8)
thes(1121,8) and was (716,8)pronounce them. I distinguished(1778,9)other
words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,
dearest, unhappy._

“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of
(546,14)(1844,8)endeared them to me; when they were(138,8), I
felt depressed(42,12)rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw
few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter(1779,12), their harsh(253,13)rude gait only enhanced to me the
superior accomplishments of my friends. T(773,10),(1230,9)(1683,8),

cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestow(1836,11)

with Felix. He was always the saddest(1622,8)group, and even to my
unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his

the disposi(1956,12)se amiabl(1760,11). In the midst of poverty
and want, Felix carri(692,8)(736,8) to(235,11) the first little
white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in
the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away(78,9) that
obstructed her path(698,8)milk-house, drew water from the well, and
brought the wood(36,10)outhouse, where,(277,8)perpetual
astonishment, he found his store(770,8)replenished by an invisible
hand(430,9)day, I believe, he worked(1084,12)or a neighbouring
farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,

but as there was little to do(45,8)frosty season, he rea(1142,9)old

“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I

he talked. I conjectured, therefore,(98,9)found on the paper signs
for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend
these also; but how was that possible when I(508,9)even(106,8)and

sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of

master of their language(2031,8)knowledge might enable me(103,12)m
overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast
(1207,9)ly presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.

“I had admired the perfect forms of my(1661,10)—their grace, beauty,
and delicate complexions(700,14)I terrified(698,8)viewed myself
in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to(1366,8) that

“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer,(2030,9)

time Felix was more employ(89,8)the heart-moving indic(312,9)

Several new kinds of plants sprang up(1869,15)(1421,11)

advanced.

“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did
not rain, as I found(290,8)call(963,8)the heavens poured forth its
waters. This frequ(1578,8)ok pla(1611,8)a high wind quickly dried the
earth(532,10)seaso(698,9)far more pleasant than it had been.

“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I
attended the mo(954,9)(1610,15)(1094,9)they were dispersed in
various occupations, I slept; the remaind(1622,9) day was spent in
observing my friends. W(118,9)had retired to rest, if there was any
moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected
my own food and fuel for(280,12). When I returned, as often as it
was necessary, I cleared their path from(1152,9) and performed those
offices(1448,8)had seen done by Felix.(1031,19) that these
labours,(94,11)by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and
once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good
spirit, wonderful_; but(1545,11)then underst(796,9)ign(1596,9)
of these terms.

“My thoughts now(1535,8)more active(1493,8)longed to discover the
motives and feeling(779,8)se lovely creatures;(1843,9)quisitive to
know why Felix (1461,8) so(1714,10) and Agatha so sad. I(189,8)

the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a
thousand pictures of presenting myself to them(1957,9)ir reception of
me. I imagine(864,10)y(169,9) disgusted, until, by my gentle
demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and
(2032,11)their love.

“These(775,10)exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to
the acqui(1585,9)art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but
supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their
tones, yet I pronounced such words as I(1068,8)ood with tolerable ease.
It was as the ass(1907,9)lap-dog; yet surely(735,12)ass whose
intentio(243,8)affectionate,(227,10)his manners were rude, deserved
better treatme(2004,8)blows and execration.

“Th(2046,11)showers and genial warmth of spring(1471,10)ltered the
aspect(2006,8)earth. Men who(920,8)this change seemed to have been

cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes(1114,10)leaves
began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation
for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and
unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of
nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the(1199,8) was tranquil,
(1823,8)future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”




Chapter 13


“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate
events that impressed me with(1891,10)which, from what I had been,
have made me(30,8)am.

“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine(1698,9)skies
cloudless. It surprised me that what(1717,8)was desert and gloomy
should now bloom with the most beautiful fl(952,10)verdure. My
senses were gratified and refreshed by a (1726,9)scents of delight and
(33,12)ights of beauty.

“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested
from labour—the old man played on his guitar(945,10)children
listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was
melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father
paused in his music, and I conjectured by(1475,11) that he inquired
the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a(1231,10)accent, and
(325,12)was recommencing(160,10) when someone tapped at the door(478,11)a lady on horseback, accompani(585,8)country-man as a guide.
The lady was dress(190,8)dark suit and covered with a thick black
veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only(302,9)by
(2018,8)ing, in a sweet(315,9)the nam(546,10). Her voice was
musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,
Felix came up hastily(1284,8)lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her
veil(612,8)beheld(388,8)(745,10)angelic beauty a(736,13). Her
hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
dark, but gentle, although animat(51,8)features of a regular
proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with
a lovely pink.

“Felix seemed ravish(607,8)(1250,8)when (355,8)er, every trait of
sorrow vanish(1851,8)his face, and it instantly(1086,8)ed a degree of
ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his
eyes sparkled, as his cheek flu(219,10)pleasure; and at that moment I
thought him as(1609,11)as(831,13). She appeared affected by
different(1895,9); wiping a few tears from her(407,8)eyes, she held
out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as
well as(330,9)distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to
understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismou(1389,8)dismissing her guide, conduc(53,8)into the(1801,8). Some
conversation took place between him and(1640,11)(1791,10)young

but he raised her and embrac(17,8)ffectionately.

“I soon perceived that(1015,10)(1417,13)uttered articulate sounds
and(611,10)to have a language of her own, she was neither understood

came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their(1801,12)s,
(1431,10)joy, the cause(1420,12)(511,18). Presently I
found(98,8) frequent recurrence of some sound whic(777,14)
repeated after them, that(733,9)endeavouring to learn their(790,9);
(1029,8)idea(1661,11)occur(355,11)hat I should make use of the
same instructions to the same end. T(965,12)learned about twenty
words(1143,8)first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those(1796,9)had
before(979,11)(890,8)profited(375,8)others.

“As night came on, Agatha(1314,9)Arabian retired early. When they
separated Felix(1654,8)(761,8)(760,8)(1380,9)and said, ‘Good night
sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with(1490,16)
(597,18)petition(1283,8)name I conjectur(1394,8)thei(1890,8)
guest w(1114,9)bjec(389,8)ir(134,8)ation. I ardently desired(1804,15)them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found
it utterly impossible.

“The next (1254,8)Felix went out to his work, an(812,11) usual
occupations of(502,8)were finished,(513,13)sa(1818,9)fee(661,8)
old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly
beautiful(394,9)y at once drew tears of(1522,9)nd (1436,8)from my
eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or
dying away like a nightingal(1008,8) woods.

“When she had(306,11)she gave the guitar to(1582,9)who at first
declined it. She(300,8)a simple air(203,16)accompanied it in
sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain(910,16). The old
man(1629,10)enraptured(943,9) some word(2027,8)Agatha(1388,10)ed to
explain to Safie, and by which he(1731,13)wish to express(1478,9)
bestowed on him the greatest(510,9)by her music(789,8)days now(1757,8)as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration
that joy had taken place of sadness in the(1822,13) of my friends.
Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the
knowledge of(1718,9), so that in two months I began to(1914,11) most
(698,9)rds uttered by my protectors.

“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and
the green banks interspers(47,8)innumerable flowers, sweet to the
scent(1666,9)eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;
the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal
rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably
shorten(1922,10)late setting and early rising(1844,9)un, for I never
ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meet(1834,9)the same
treatment I had formerly endured(731,8)first village which I entered.

“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily
mas(1683,8)(734,8); and I may boast(64,8)(804,9)more(809,9)than
(1700,11), who understood very little and(1979,8)ed in broken
(1338,9)whilst I(833,11)ed and could imitate almos(1993,8)word that
was spoken.

“While(989,12)in speech, I also learned the science of letters as
it was taugh(797,8)(1467,9), and this opened before me a wide field
for wonder(1851,12)(1328,8)book from which Felix instructed (1225,10)Volney’s _Ruins
of Empires_. I should not have(392,12)the purport of this book had not
Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this
work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitatio(1829,8)
Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory (1465,13)history
and a view(1924,9)everal empires at present existing(1641,8)world; it gave
me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions(2048,8)different
nat(25,12)earth. I heard(1161,9)lothful Asiatics,(1187,9)tupendous
genius and mental activity(1232,8)Grecian(62,10)wars and wonderful virtue(1717,8)early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the
decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings(258,9)(1854,8)discover(204,9)American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the
hapless fate of its original inhabitants.

“These(277,11)narrations inspired me with(1040,8) feelings. Was
man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuo(436,8)agnificent, yet so

godlike. To be a great and(194,10)man(153,10)the highest honour
(103,11)fall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on
record have been,(116,14)lowest degradation, a condition more
abject than that(2029,8)blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I

even why there were laws and(1096,12); but when(1052,9)details of

pov(39,9)rank, descent, and noble blood(2005,8)words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the
possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and
unsullied(167,8) united with riches. A man might be respec(38,8)
only o(1476,8)ese advantages, but without either he was considered,
except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to
waste his powers for the profit(1872,9)chosen few! And what was I? Of
my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I(409,8)ed no money, no friends, no kind(602,12). I was, besides,
endu(395,8)a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even(1950,8)same nature as man. I was more agile(1257,8)ey and could
subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of h(1522,8)cold with
less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked
around I saw and (944,9)none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot
(1075,8) earth, from which all men fled and whom(22,9)disowned?

“I cannot describe to you the agony(936,9)se reflections inflicted
upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increas(891,8)knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor
known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst,(382,8)t!

“Of what a(1399,9)nature is (163,9)! It clings(1501,8)mind when it

through mea(1922,9)I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and
unknown, and which rather(717,11)than satisfied the desire I had of
becoming one among my fellows. T(279,10)words of Agatha and the

question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.

“I will soon explain to what these(1668,8)s tended, but allow me now to
return(1829,8)(1474,11)whose story excited in me such(674,8)(1590,10)of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated
in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in
an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”




Chapter 14


“Some time elapsed before(1996,13)e history of(853,11). It was
one which could not fail to(1363,8) itself deeply on my mind, unfolding
as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting(376,11)ful to
one so utterly inexperienced as I was.

“The name(1655,16)was De Lacey. He was descended from a good
family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,
respected by his superiors and belov(29,10)equals. His son was bred(1463,8)service of his country, and(1979,8)had ranked with lad(1605,11)highest distinction. A few months(545,8)my arrival (1263,8) lived in

Turkish merchant and had inhabit(260,8)(542,15), when, for some
reaso(1557,9)(866,11)learn, he became obnoxious(1254,8)government.
He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from
Constantinople to join him(810,9)tri(99,8)ondemned to death. The
injust(680,11)sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was(1404,8)nt;
and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime
alleged against him(486,23)his(209,8)ation.

“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and
(1611,11) were uncontrollable when he heard the decision(945,8)court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then
looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain
admittance(1893,8)prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
unguarded part(1429,8)building, which lighted the dunge(267,10)unfortunate Muhammadan, who, load(1267,8)chains, wa(2031,8)despair the
execut(355,10) barbarou(680,10). Felix visi(141,8)grate at night
and made known(276,14)er his intentions in his favour. The Turk,
ama(945,8)delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal(1534,8)deliverer
by promises of reward(797,11)(208,8)rejected his offers with
contempt, yet(662,9)saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit
her(1362,8)and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the
youth(1289,11)help owning to his own mind that the captive (1623,9)

accept t(566,9), yet he looked forward(1050,10)obability(1223,8)event a(1724,9)consumma(904,8)his happiness.

“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going(142,9)for

letters that he rece(1842,9) this(802,8)girl, who found means to
express her thoughts in the languag(464,9)lover(492,8)aid of an old
man, a servant(513,8)father who understood French. She thanked him in
the most ardent terms fo(1207,11)ded services towards her parent, and
at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.

“I have copies of these letters, for I(320,12), during my residence
in the hovel, to procure(930,8)lements of writing;(1808,8)(108,8)
were often(396,8)hands(942,10)or Agatha. Before I depart I will
give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,
as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat
the substanc(752,8)(153,8).

“Safie related(719,8)r mother was a Christian Arab, sei(1697,8)made a
slave(1164,8)Turks; recommended(1524,8)beauty, she had w(1297,15)
the(1583,8)of(1629,12)married her. The young girl spoke in high and
enthusiastic terms(1305,8)mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the
bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her(1527,10)in
the tenet(129,9)religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden(1399,8)female
foll(77,8) Muhammad. This lady died, but her less(1345,9)indelibly

retur(1978,8)Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,
allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to
the temper(1847,8)soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble
emulation for virtue. T(247,15)marrying(842,13)and
remaining in a country where women were (241,8)to take a rank in
society was enchanting to her.

“The day for the execu(1889,8)(941,8) was fix(515,8)on the night
previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant
many leagues from Paris. Felix had(1451,8)d passpor(1804,10)name of
his father, sister, and himself. He had (177,8)ly communicated his
pla(795,10)ormer, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
the pret(893,8)a journey and conceale(154,9), with his(1052,9), in
an obscure part of Paris.

“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont
Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable
opportunity of passing into som(190,10)(1533,8)ish dominions(1637,12)solved to remain with her(1525,8)until the moment of his

should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in

of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest
affection. They convers(178,8)one another(557,9)(156,8)s of an

plans. He loathed the idea that(949,13) (579,20)a

lukewarm, for he knew that he was still(1300,8)power of(706,14)

secretl(522,10)(392,13)with him when he departed. His plans
were facilitated by the news which arrived(1682,12)

“The govern(439,9)rance were greatly enraged at the escape of their
victim and spared no pains to detect and punish(1162,14). The
plo(565,11)was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were
thrown into prison. T(260,8)reache(1266,8)and roused him from his
dream of pleasure. His blind and aged(1471,8)and his gentle sister lay
in a noisome dungeon whil(1319,17)free air an(1336,13) of
her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He(309,9)arranged
(1245,9)Turk that if the lat(999,11)find(1801,13) (1801,11)
for(501,8)before (1971,8)uld return to Italy, Safi(1012,9)remain as a
boarder at a convent at(1970,8);(263,8)n, quitting the lovely(1606,9)
he hastened to Paris and(1760,9)d himself up(1031,8)vengeanc(697,8)

“He did not succeed. They(1871,10)confined for five months(2006,8)the

became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with

as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.

“Such were the events that preyed on the hear(1960,11)and rendered
him, when I first saw him, the most(547,11)of(429,11). He could
have(444,9)poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his
virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitud(1685,8) Turk(1365,9)loss
of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The
arrival(104,8)Arabian now infused new life into his soul.

“When(1944,10)(1684,8)Leghorn that(1793,11)(1013,9)of his wealth

expostulate with her fath(153,8)he left her angrily, reiterating his
tyrannical mandate.

“A few days after,(1796,10)enter(295,15)’s apartment and told
her hastily that he had reason to believe(1134,10)residence(1750,11)

Constantinople, for which city(144,12)ail in a few hours. He
intended to leave(624,14)under the care of a confidential
servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part(1037,8)property, which had not yet arrived(379,11)(884,9)alone, Safie resolved in her own mind th(1373,10)conduct that it
would become her to pursue in this emergency. A(522,11)in Turkey
was abhorrent to her; her religion and her(1646,8)s were alike averse
to it. By some papers of(832,11) which fell into her hands she

he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her
determination. Taking(1041,10)some jewels that belonged(1187,8)and a

Germany.

Chapter 15


“Such was the history of my beloved(569,8)rs. It impressed me deeply.
I learned,(624,10)views of social life which it developed, to admire
their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.

“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and
generosity were ever present before me, incit(1101,8)in me a desire to
become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities
were called forth and displayed. But in giving an accou(754,9)
progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstanc(408,8)occurred
(189,8)eginning(1502,8)month of Augus(873,9)same year.

“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I
collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on
the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and
some books. I eagerly seized the prize and return(1220,8)it to my hovel.
Fortunately the books were written(578,8)(1574,8), the elements of which I
had acquired at(1518,12); they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume
of _Plutarch’s Lives_(1458,9) _Sorrows of Werter_. The
possessio(1234,8)se treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually
studied and exercised my mind upon thes(1194,8)ies, whilst my friends were
employed in their ordinary occupations.

“I can hardly describe to you the effec(1622,8)s(512,9)They produced
in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In
(430,23), besides the interest of its simple an(1991,9)ng
story,(1206,9)opinions are canvassed and(1241,9)lights thrown upon
what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that(959,9)in it a
never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and
domestic manners it(496,9)d, combi(945,9)lofty sentiments and
(449,10)which had for(609,8)bject something out of self, accorded
well with my experience among(1223,14) and with the wants which
were for ever alive in(1325,8)bosom. But I thought Werter himself a
more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character
contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon
death and suicide (1799,8)culated to fill me with wonder. I did not
pretend to enter(799,10)merits(1728,8)case, yet I inclined towards
the(736,10)of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely
understanding it.

“As I read, however, I applied much personally to(1779,9)eelings and
condition.(1755,9)myself similar yet(1534,8)same time strangely
unlike(1914,8)beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I
was a listener. I sympathis(1773,8)and partly understood them, but I
was unformed in mind; I was dependent on non(1871,8)(525,9)none.
‘The path of my departure was free,’(1723,8)re was none to lament my
annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did
this mean? Who was I? What(12,10)ence did I come(31,11)my
destination? These questions(1825,12) recurred, but I was unable to
solve them.

“The volume (2009,21) which I possessed (974,10)the
(1893,9)(831,8)first founder(853,9)ancient republics. This book
had a far different(1872,8)upon me from (1714,23). I
learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but (247,8)
taught me high(1302,8)s; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my
own reflections, to admire and l(62,8)heroes of past ages. Many
thing(1044,8) surpassed m(815,9)anding and(1569,11). I had a very
confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,
and boundless seas(1593,8)was perfectly unacquaint(1827,8)towns and
large assemblages of men. The cottage of(1758,15)had been the
only school in(669,9)had studied human nature, but t(617,9)developed new and mightier scenes of ac(1346,8)read of men(1285,8)ed
in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the
greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as
far as I(1347,15) signification of those terms, relative as they
were, as(1650,11)them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these
(1675,8), I wa(592,8)rse led(770,11)peaceable lawgivers, Numa,
Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The
patriarchal lives(591,18)caused these impressions to take a
firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had
been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should
have been imbu(1856,8)(1323,10)sensations.

“But _Paradise Lost_ excited(1375,11)and far deeper emotions(758,8)
it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as
a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the
picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of
exciting. I often referred the several situations, as(960,8)imilarity
struck me, to my own. Like Adam(762,8)apparently united by no link to
any other being in existence; but his state was(1819,15)from mine
in ever(77,8)respect. He had come forth(1856,10)hands of God a
perfect(313,9), happy and prosperous, guard(1005,9) especial care of
his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire(1689,11)from
beings of a superior(1485,13)I was(1910,9), helpless, and alone.
Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for
often, like him, when I viewed the blis(1127,18), the bitter
gall of envy ro(1502,12).

“Another circumstance strengthened and confirm(1211,9)(1389,8). Soon
after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers(38,8)pocket of
the dres(990,8)I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had
neglect(1602,9)but now tha(445,8)able to decipher the characters in
which they were written, I began to study them(1297,8)ligence. It was
your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You
minutely described in thes(320,9)every step you took(340,9)rogress
of your work; this(1296,8) was mingl(1493,8)accounts of domestic
occurrences. You doubtless recollect(151,13). Here they are.
Everything is relat(205,9)m which bears (1896,13)my accursed
origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting(724,13)s
which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own
horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful
day(1040,8)received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!
Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in
disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid ev(1056,8)the
very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire
and encourage him(1536,8)am solitary and abhorred.’

“These were the reflection(1444,8)hours of despondency and solitude;
but(1513,8)contemplated the virtues(1102,8)cottagers, their amiable and
benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should
become acquaint(1062,8)my admira(795,8)their(156,9)they would
compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn
(472,8)ir door one, however monstrous, who solicited their (129,10)
and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way
to fit(312,8)for an interview with(1239,12)would decide my fate. I
postponed this attempt for some(1571,8)longer, for the importance
attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.
Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every
day’s experience(1899,12)unwilling to commence this undertaking
until a few mor(254,9)should have added to my sagacity.

“Several changes,(1792,8)meantime, took place(1820,8)cottage. The
presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also
(319,11)a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha
spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in
their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were
contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while
mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only
discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I
cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished(1865,8)beheld(1177,10)
reflected in water or my shadow(621,9)oonshine, even as that frail
image a(862,8)inconstant shade.

“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify(1153,12)the trial
which in(844,9)nths(1258,11) to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my
thoughts, unchecked by reason, to rambl(849,9)fields of Paradise, and
dared to fancy(1694,12) lovely creatures sympathising(1640,8)
(622,9)and cheering my gloom(660,8)angelic countenances breathed
smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my
sorrows nor shared my (292,8); I was alone. I remembered Adam’s
supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,
and(1245,8)bitterness of my heart I cursed him.

“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay
and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it
had worn(873,8)first(879,8)the woods and the(541,8)moon. Yet I did
not heed the bleak(259,8)the weather(400,8)better fitted by my
conformation(1876,9)endurance of cold than heat. But my chief
delights were the sight(129,8)flowers, the birds, and all the gay
apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention
towards(1743,12)rs. Their(1720,11)was not decreased by the
ab(1781,9)summer. They loved and(912,10)(130,8)one another; and
their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupt(133,10)casualties that(1962,12)around them. The more I saw of them, the
(1899,8)became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my
heart yearned to be known(1194,9)(312,8)se(1221,9)(1210,9); to see
their sweet looks directed (431,8)me with affection was the utmost
limit of my ambition. I dared not think tha(1969,8)ould turn them from
(104,8)disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were
never driven away. I asked(1869,14)for (391,8)treasures than a
little food or rest: I require(393,10)(628,12)y; but I did not
believe(1781,8)utterly unworthy of it.

“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution(1081,8)seasons had taken
place since I awoke into life. My(906,10) at this time was solely
(508,18)y plan of introducing(1993,8)into(974,12) of my
protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally
fixed was to enter the dwelling(1151,8)e blind old man should be alone.
I had sagacity enough to discover(660,9) unnatural hideous(1706,10)
pers(759,11)chief object of horror with those who had formerly
beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I
thought, therefore, that if(1891,8)(1313,11)his children I could gain
the good will and media(605,12)old De Lacey, I might by his means
be tolera(1705,9) younge(1206,9)ors.

“One day,(436,10)sun shone on the red(1983,8)that strewed the ground
and diffused cheerfulness(326,11)it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,
and Felix departed on a long country walk,(2005,9)old man, at his own
desire, was left alone(388,8)cottage. When(391,14)had(122,9),
he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more
sweet and(40,10)than I had ever heard him play before. At first his
countenance was illuminat(1996,8)pleasure, but as he continued,(670,8)ful(1305,10)adness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.

“My heart beat quick; this(1692,9)hour and moment of trial, which
would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a
neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around(1326,12); it was an
excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute(1440,8), my
limbs failed me and I sank to(845,11). Again I rose, and exerting
all the firm(1282,8)(1438,8)was master, removed the planks(1477,9)had
placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived
me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their
(908,8)

“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ sai(1005,13). ‘Come in.’

“I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am
a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you
would allow me to remain a few minutes(358,8)the fire.’

“‘Enter(155,8)(1485,10)‘and I will try in what
manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my(1639,10)are
from ho(444,8)as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to
procure food for you.’

“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is
warmth and rest only that I need.’

“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was
precious to me, yet I remained irresolute(377,8) manner to commence
the interview(1849,11)old man addressed me.

‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my(1772,8)man; are you
French?’

“‘No; but I was educ(2023,8)a French family and understand that
(135,8) only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,
whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour(493,8)some hopes.’

“‘Are they Germans(221,8), they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an

beneficial; but a fatal(127,10) clouds their eyes, and where they
ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable

you undeceive them?’

“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I
feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tend(668,10)(616,13); I

kindness towards them; but(365,8)lieve(1764,8)wish to injure them, and
it is that(505,11)which(54,11)overcome.’

“‘Where do(832,15)reside?’

“‘Near this spot.’

“T(1733,11)paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly
confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in

to be in any way serviceable to a human(1699,9).’

raise me from the dust by this (666,8); and I trust that, by your aid,

“‘May I know the names and residence of(91,14)?’

“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to
rob me of or bestow happiness on m(285,10). I struggled vainly for
firmness sufficient to answer him,(1523,8) effort destroyed all my
remaining strength; I sank(316,8)chair and sobbed aloud. At that
moment(520,13)steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment
to lose, but seizing the hand of t(1570,10), I cried, ‘Now is the

“‘Great God!’ exclaimed(179,12). ‘Who are you?’

“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and
Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on
beholding me? Agatha faint(119,8)Safie, un(1591,9)ttend to her
friend, rushed out(430,8)cottage. Felix darted forward, and with
supernatural force tor(1604,10)his father, to whose knees I clung, in
a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently
with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends
the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and
I refrained. I saw hi(1239,18)repeating his blow, when,
overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted(638,12), and(749,8)general
tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”




Chapter 16


“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in(790,13), did I
not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly
bestowed?(1521,8)not; despair(1166,9)yet taken possession of me; my
feelings were those of rage and revenge(565,10)with pleasure have
(1409,10)(1008,12)and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with
their shrieks and misery.

“When night came(485,11)my retreat and wandere(492,9)wood; and
now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my
anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken
the toils,(1725,8)(1562,8)objects that obstructed me and ranging
through(226,9) (993,9)ag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable
night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees
waved their branches above me; now(54,8)n the sweet voice of a bird
burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest
or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell(1201,10), and
finding(661,8)unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread
havoc and destruction around(108,8) then to have sat down and enjoyed
the ruin.

“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became
fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank(1424,8)damp grass in
the sick impotence of(1140,8). There was none among the myriads of men
that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness
towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war
against the species, and more than all, (40,8)him who had formed me
and sent me forth to this insupportable(1232,11)The sun rose; I heard the voice(297,8) and knew that it was
impossible to return to(1291,12)during that day. Accordingly I hid
myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours
to reflection on my situation(236,8)pleasant sunshine(1104,9)pure air of day restored me to some
degree of tranquillity; and when I considered w(1390,8)passed at the
cottage,(1738,9)not help believ(304,9)I had been too hasty in my
conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that
my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a
fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I
ought(1154,9)familiarised the old De Lacey to(1208,9)by degrees to
have(1840,9)(1999,10)to the rest(123,8)family, when they(982,8)have
been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be
irretrievable, and after much(545,9)ation I resolved(835,14)(553,13)seek(269,9)man(258,9)my representations win him to my
part(1000,8)se thoughts calme(1541,10)in the afternoon I sank into a profound
sleep; but the fever of my blood(283,9)allow me to be visited by
peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever
acting before my eyes; the females were flying(996,9)enraged Felix
tearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and (1953,8)that
it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in
search of food.

“When my hunger(960,8)eased, I directed my steps (1672,8)the
well-known path(1942,8)nducted(918,8)cottage. All t(1844,9)at peace.
(198,8)into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the
accustomed hour(886,9) family arose. That hour passed, the sun
mounted high(679,8)heavens,(648,9)cottagers(640,10)ppear. I
trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside
of(304,12) was dark(1292,8)heard no motion; I cannot describe the
agony of this suspense.

“Presently two countrymen(1595,8)by, but pausing near(450,12), they
entered into(1500,13), using(261,8) gesticulations; b(1241,12)
understand what they said, as they spoke the languag(950,9)country,
which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix
(1405,8)ed with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not
quit(1750,8)(455,8)that morning, and waited anxiously to(1623,9) from
his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.

“‘Do you(1537,9),’ said his companion to him,
‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose
the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and
I beg therefore (155,14)take some days to(1763,9)(121,8)
determination.’

“‘It is utterly useless,’ repli(1443,8); ‘we can
never again inhabit your(1219,10)The life of my father is(1757,8)greatest
danger, owing(1290,8)(1025,9)circumstance that I have related. My wife and
my sister will never re(560,10) their horror. I entreat you not to reason
with me any more. Take possession(456,9)tenem(497,8)let me fly(867,8)is
place.’

“Felix (1286,18) as he said this. He an(655,15)(1106,9)(1132,13)in which they(1546,10)for a few minutes,(1913,8)n
departed. I never saw a(1295,8)(1553,9)of De Lacey more.

“I continued for the remainder(1143,8)day in(1700,10)in a state of
utter and stupid despair. M(1162,12) had (171,8) and had broken
the only link(1120,8)ld me(1871,8)world. For the first time the
feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom(1627,8)(1746,8)strive to
control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I
bent my mind towards injury and death. When I though(1465,8)friends,(1813,8)mild voice(446,12), the gentle eyes of Agatha(535,9)
exquisite beaut(525,9)Arabian, these(128,8)s vanished and a gush of
tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected t(1755,9)had
spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to
injure anything human, I turned my fury(373,11)animate objects. As
night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles aroun(937,14)
and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation(1331,9)arden,
I(1816,8)with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my
operations.

“As the (234,16)a fierce wind arose(1353,9) woods and quickly
dispers(2009,8)louds that had loitered(1540,8)heavens; the blast tore
along like a mighty avalanche and(1867,8)d a kind of insanity in my
spirits that burst all bounds of reason and(645,8)ion. I lighted the
dry branch of a tree and danc(386,9)ury(496,12)devoted(504,10)my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of(1494,10) moon
nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid(1207,8)waved my
brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fi(1640,8)straw, and heath,
and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned(1409,8)e(1133,10)cottage was(575,8) enveloped(1315,8)flam(102,10)clung to it and
licked it with their fork(1081,10)troying tongue(746,8)soon as I was convinc(1156,8)no assistance could save any(370,8)
the habitation, I quitt(307,8)cene and sought for refuge(973,8)woods.

“And now,(196,9) world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I
resolved to fly far(935,10)scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated
and despised, every country must be equally horrible. A(626,9)the
(1694,11)you crossed(1758,8). I learned from your papers that you
were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness
than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had
bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had(233,13)
(1852,8)e relative situations(1898,8)different countrie(27,9)earth.
You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and(1767,8)
this place I (573,12)proceed.

“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a
southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my
only guide. I did not know(236,9)(315,9)tow(445,8)I was to pass
through, nor(562,10)sk information from a single human being; but I
(125,8)despair. From you only(650,9)hope for succour, although
towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,
heartless(779,8)! (524,8)endowed me with perceptions and passions
and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.
But on(253,10)had I any claim for pity and redress, an(1011,10) I
determined to seek that justice(1625,9)vainly attempted to gain from
any other being that wore th(456,8)form.

“My travels were long(1679,8) sufferings I endured intense. It was
late in autumn when(1530,15)district where I had so long resided.
I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a
(675,11). Nature decayed around m(1902,10) sun became heatless;
rain and snow pour(61,12); mighty rivers were frozen; the surface
(1185,12) was hard and chill, and ba(2045,8)I found no shelter. Oh,
earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the caus(1750,8)being! The
mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turn(603,8)ll
and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more
deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow
fe(320,8)the wat(393,9)hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents
now(744,8)n directe(543,10)I possessed a map(1677,8)country(1282,8)often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me
no respite; no(165,9) occurred from which my rage and misery could
not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened(944,8)arrived
(585,8)onfines of Switzerland, when(1682,9)had recovered its warmth(1364,8) earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial
manner the(629,11)(1404,16)(334,10).

“I generally(506,8)du(1064,9)day and(1125,16)when I was
secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding
that(509,8) lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey
after(361,14)is(1125,8)day, which was one(2033,8)first of spring,
cheered even me by the loveli(1044,8)its sunshine(1533,9)balm(34,8)
the air.(1957,8)emotions of gentle(416,9)pleasure,(617,8)d long
appeared dead, revive(1139,10). Half surprised(170,8)novelty of
these sensations, I(838,10)yself to be borne away by them, and
forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears
(717,8)dewed my cheeks(1479,8)even raised my humid eyes with
thankfulness towards the blessed sun(475,8)bestowed such joy upon me.

“I(566,9)d to wind among the paths(1203,8)wood, until I came to its
boundar(589,13)skirted by(691,8)and rapid river, into(1166,8)any(1772,8)trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.
Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue,(1216,8)heard
the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal(566,8)und(877,8)hade
of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running
(473,12)spot where I was(124,8)ed, laughing, as if she ran from
someone in sport. She(502,11)her course al(505,9)recipitous sides(413,8)river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the
rapid stream. I rush(1686,8)my hiding-place and with extreme labour,
(1358,9)forc(1201,9)current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She
was senseles(886,10)ndeavo(1471,8)every means in my power to restore
animation(578,9)was(282,10)interrupt(1161,10)approach of a rustic,
who was probably the person(1974,8)om she had playfully fled. On
seeing me, he darted(1050,9)me, and tea(1737,9)girl(379,9)arms,
hasten(56,11)the deeper part(1035,13). I followed speedily, I
hardly knew why; but(2032,10)man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,
which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my
injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped(675,9) wood.

“This was t(185,8)reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being
from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed(1093,11)miserable
pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of
kind(1885,9)(1900,11)which I had entertained but a few moments
before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by
pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the
agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses(1541,9)and I fainted.

“For some weeks I led a(369,10) life in(1784,9)s,(1052,10)ing to
cure the(403,13)I had received. The ball(350,10)ed my shoulder,
and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented
also(1189,8)oppressive sens(1383,9)injustice and ingratitud(1416,8)ir
infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly(26,8),
such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had
endured.

“Afte(497,13)(569,9)heal(546,10)(1813,10)my journey. The
labours I endured were no longer to be allevia(1518,11)bright sun or
gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my
desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for
the enjoyment of pleasure.

“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I
reached the environs of Geneva.

“It was evening(1861,8)arriv(955,10)retired to a hiding-place among
the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply
to you. I was(771,8)ed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to
enjoy the (493,18)(229,8)or the prospect(1878,8)sun setting
behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.

“At(371,11)a slight sleep relieved me(413,8)e (1614,8)reflectio(1905,9)was disturb(707,10)approach of a beautiful child, who came
running(1868,10)recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of
infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this
little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have
imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and
educate him as my companion and friend,(647,10)not be so (995,9)in
this peopled earth.

“Urg(1126,8)is impulse, I(278,8)on the boy as he(1593,8)and drew him
towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before
his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I(118,8)s hand forcibly from his
face and said, ‘C(608,8)at is the meaning of this? I do not intend to
hurt you; listen to me.’

“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;
‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You

“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with(237,8)‘Hideous (198,9)(230,9). My papa is a syndic—he is M.
Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep(116,9)(59,12)! you belong then to my enemy—to him (642,8)whom I have
sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’

“The child still(492,11)and loaded (294,8)epithets which carried
despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence(1174,8)d in a
moment he lay dead at my feet.

“(1232,11)my vict(64,8)(115,8) swelled with exultat(1079,8)hellish
triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create(1119,8)ion;
(402,8) is not invulnerable; this death will carry (294,11)(252,8)
a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’

“As I fixed my eyes(1216,8)child, I saw something glittering on his
breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite
of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I
gaz(441,8)delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her
lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was
for ever deprived of the(152,8)s that such(2007,12)reatures could
bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in
regarding me, have chang(171,8)air of divine benignity to one
expressive of disgust and affright.

“Can you wonder(215,11)thoughts transport(1027,11)rage? I only
(59,12)at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in
exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the
attempt to(805,9)them.

“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had
committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I
en(2017,8)barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was
sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so(671,11)as her
whose(985,10)I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming(366,8)loveliness of youth and health. Here, I(583,8), is one of those whose
joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over
her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would
give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my
beloved, awake!(1883,8)sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she
indeed awake(627,9) me, and curs(14,10)denounce(678,11)er? Thus
w(82,8) assuredly act if(1381,9)ened eyes op(1466,9)she beheld me.
The(1054,8) was madness; it(226,8) the fiend within me—not I, but
she, shall suffer;(854,11) I have (882,10)because I am (1436,8)
robbed of all(1378,10)could give me, she shall atone. The crime had
its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of
Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work
mischief.(725,12) (725,8)placed th(949,11)securely in one of
the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.

“For some days I haun(1253,8)(1284,11)these scenes had taken place,
sometimes wishing to see you, (30,10)resolved to quit the world and
its miseries(487,9). At length I wandered towards these mountains,
and have r(1835,8)rough their immense recesses, consumed by a burning
passio(1445,8)you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have
promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man
will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself
would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species(350,10)(26,9)defects. This being you must create.”




Chapter 17


The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me(2029,8)expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to
arrange my ideas sufficiently to underst(988,8)full extent of his
propo(459,8)He continued,

“Y(265,14) a female for me with whom I can liv(227,9)interchang(1846,11)sympathies necessary for my being. This(690,10)
can do(1015,8)demand it of you as a right(748,11)must not refuse to
concede.”

The latter par(265,8) tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had
died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and
as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burne(1695,8)
me.

“I do(244,8)it,” I replied; “and no tortur(1620,8)ever extort a
consent from me. You may render(266,8)most(999,10) of men, but you
shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I(605,9)nother like
yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate(1418,10). Begone! I
have answered you; you may(263,9)me, but I wi(182,9)consent.”

“You ar(953,8) wrong,”(344,8) the fien(354,8)instead
of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I
am(1363,10). Am I not shunn(1328,8)ated by all mankind? You, my creator,
would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I
should pity man more than he pities me? You (1462,10)call it murder if you
could precipitate me into on(1078,11)ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the
work of your own hand(613,11)respect man when he condemns me? Let him
liv(1699,9)(502,8)(1228,15)kindness, (499,11) of injury I would
bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.
But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our
union. Yet min(1029,8)not be the submiss(1687,8)bject slavery. I will
reve(1654,8)njuries; if I(159,8)inspire love,(859,8)cause fear, and
chiefly towards you my arch-enemy,(773,9)(709,11) do I swear
inextinguishable hatred. Have a care;(986,8)work at your destruction, nor
finish until I(1111,10)your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of
your birth.”

A fiendish rage animated him (1530,15); his face was wrinkled
into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently
he calmed himself and proceeded—

“I intended(1184,10). This passion is detrimental to me, for you do
not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt
emotions of benevolence(554,9)me, I should return them a hundred and a
hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake(946,8) make peace with the
whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss(938,15) realised.
What I as(1194,8) is reasonable and moderate; I demand a(175,9) of
(1831,8)sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it
is all that I can receive, and it(743,8)ontent me. It is true, w(1089,8)be
monsters, cut off from all(1947,10); but on that account(70,12) more
attached to one another. Our lives wi(1207,10)happy, but they will be
harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! M(1127,11)make me
happy; let me feel(1450,11)(1211,12)for one(1511,8)! Let me see that I
excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my
request!”

I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences
of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.
His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be(729,11)
of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe hi(608,10)portion
of happine(904,8)it was in my power to bestow? He saw my (2014,9)
feeling and continued,

“If you(307,10)neither you nor any othe(1427,8)being shall ever see
us again(1689,9)go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not
that of man; I(559,10)stroy the lamb(405,9)kid to glut my appetite;
acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will
be(621,8)same nature(1167,10) and(921,8)(1103,9)(1377,8) same fare.
W(1107,8)make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on
man(114,10)ripen our food. The picture I(1827,8) to(1424,8)peaceful
and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the
wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been(1770,12)
I now see com(1930,9)n your eyes(1182,9)seize the favourable moment
and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”

“You propose,” replied I, “to fly(1367,10)habita(1979,8)
man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts(1196,8)fiel(555,10)your
onl(624,11)s. How can you, who long for the love and(1380,13)man,
persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and
y(51,8)mee(715,10)ir detestation; your evil passions(774,9)renewed,
(604,8)will then have a(867,11)to aid you in the task of destruction.
This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot(1540,8).”

“How inconstant are your(1494,9)! But a moment ago you were moved by
my represent(1485,12)why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?
I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that
(1137,9)(1213,10)you bestow,(1424,8)quit the neighbourhood of man and
dwell, as it may chance,(413,8)most savage of places. My(523,14)
will have fled(405,8)sha(599,13)(711,8)! My life will flow quietly
away, and in my dying moments(84,9)not curse my maker.”

His words had a strange effect upon me. I(1152,11)ated him and
sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when
I saw the filthy ma(1988,8)moved and talked, my heart sickened and my(1981,8)s were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle
these sensations; I thought that as I could not(1132,8)ise with him, I
had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which
was yet in my power to bestow.

“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not
already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust
you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by
affording a wider scope for your revenge?(1191,9)s this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If
I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my(430,8);
(1651,9)of another will destroy the cause of my crimes(154,8)shall
become a thing of whose existence everyone(1819,9)ignorant. My vices
are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will
necessarily arise(953,9)ive in communion with an equal.(1214,9)feel
the(334,11) of a sensitive being and become link(939,8)e chain of
(259,10)and events from(1534,9)am now excluded.”

I paused some time to reflect on all he had relat(1119,8)he various
arguments which(47,8)employed.(1042,11)of the promise of(336,10)hich
he had displayed on the opening of his(494,11)(140,8)subsequent blight
of all kindly(1942,8)(1814,8)loath(343,8)scorn(188,8)is protectors had
manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my
calcul(1315,8)a creature who could exist(1818,8)ice-caves(307,8)glaciers
and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices
was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a
long p(953,8)reflection I concluded that the justice due both to(1825,9)my fellow(288,9)s demanded of m(917,9)should comply(1610,8)s request.
Turning to him, therefore,(1527,8)

“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Eur(1390,8)ever,
and every other place(457,8)neighbourhood of man, as soon as(1242,9)deliver in(141,8)hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”

“I(1762,9)he cried, “by the sun, and(777,8)blue sky of
heave(31,14)fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my
prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depar(400,9)
home and commence your labours;(1351,9)watch their progress with
unutterable anxiety; and fear not bu(1910,8)hen you are ready(1655,9)appear.”

Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in
my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than
the flight of an eagle, and quickly los(1048,12)und(1161,8) of the
sea of ice.

His tale had occupied the whole day,(1399,11)n was upon the verge of
the horizon when he departed. I knew(1890,8)ought to hasten my descent
(1394,8)the valley,(821,8)ould soon be encompassed in darkness; but my
heart was heavy(1999,9)steps slow. The labour of winding(1362,10)
little path(1431,9)(418,9)and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced
perplexed me,(352,10)as I was(1697,8)emotion(1875,8)the occurrences
of the day had produced. Night was far(118,9) when I came to the
halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars
shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines
rose before me, (1364,10)her(2023,9)re a broken tree lay on the
ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange
thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I
exclaimed, “Oh! stars and(274,8)and winds, ye are all about to mock
me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as
nought; but if not, depar(8,8)t, and leave me(828,12).”

These were wild and miserable (305,8), but I cannot describe to you
how the eternal twinkling(837,8)stars weighed upon me and how I
listened to every blast(934,8) as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its
way to consume me.

Morning dawned(642,8)I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no
rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could
give no expression to my(495,10)s—they(300,9)on me with a
(1582,8)’s weight(1447,8)ir excess destroyed my agony beneath them.
Thus I(198,10)ho(910,9)ntering the house, presen(1069,11)to the
family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I
answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed
under a ban—(32,8)had no right to claim their sympathies—as if
never more might I enjoy companionship wi(322,8) Yet even thus I
loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate
(348,10)my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation
made every other circumstance of existence pass(1419,10) like a dream,
and that(1020,8) only had to me the reality of life.




Chapter 18


Day after day, week after week,(1588,8)away on my return(841,10); and
I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the
venge(262,8)the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my
repugnanc(1887,8) task which was enjoined me. I fou(329,8)(196,11)
compose a female without again devoting several months to profound
study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries
having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of(242,10)
material(1218,8)uccess, and I sometimes(585,10)f obtaining my
father’s consent to visit England for this purpose;(1671,8)lung to
every pretence of delay and shrank from tak(1241,8)first step in an
undertaking whose(1497,10) necessity began to appear less absolute to
me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had
hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. M(404,8) saw this(208,8)with pleasure, and he (1602,8)i(484,9)s
towards the best method of eradicat(1635,8)remains of my melancholy,
which every now(1766,8)n would(1067,8)by fits, and with a devouring
blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took
refuge in the most perfect solitude. I(1230,8)whole days on the lake
alone in a little boat, watch(1904,8)clouds and listening(1901,8)rippling(1216,8)waves, silent(51,9)less. But the fresh air and
bright sun seldom failed to(601,8) me to some degree of compo(501,9)
(1451,13)I met the salutatio(462,9)friends(407,8)readier smile
and a more cheerful heart.

It was after(1559,11)from on(1475,8)se rambles that my father,
calling me aside, thus addressed me,

“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former
(786,8)s and seem to be retur(451,8)yourself. And yet you are still
(925,8)and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in
conjecture as(1695,8)cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,
and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a
point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”

I trembled violently at his exordium,(1293,8)father continued—

“I confess, my(467,11)I have always looked forward(432,8)
marria(1275,8)our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort(1207,8)
sta(1417,8)declining years. You were attached to each other from your
earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and
tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of
man that what I conceived to be(1542,10)assistants to my plan may have
(138,9)destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any
wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you(132,9) met with(256,8)
whom(35,9)love; and considering(987,9) as bound in honour to
(558,9), this struggle may occasion the poignant(778,8)which you appear
to feel.”

“My dear(1267,8) reassure(1130,11)I love my cousin tenderly and
sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as(759,11)does, my
warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects ar(503,11)bound up(1898,8)expectation(862,8)union.”

“The expression of your sentiments(1270,8) subject(1496,10)Victor,
gives me more (1479,8) than(1055,8)f(1393,13)(759,10)d. If you
feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast
a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so
strong a hold(276,9)mind(1269,8)wish to dissipate. Tell me,
therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnis(416,9)the(1329,9). We have been unfortunate, and rec(261,11)have drawn us
from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You
are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as(1936,9)of a competent
fortune, that an early (1563,10)ould at all interfere(1093,8)(766,8)
plans of(1049,8)and utility that(1159,14)formed. D(177,14)
however(1732,9)(463,10)ctate happiness to you or that a delay on
your par(1953,8)cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words
with cand(203,8)answer me, I conjure you, with confidence(1147,11)ity.”

I listened to(1991,11)in sil(52,8) remained(916,15)incapable
of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of
thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me
the idea of(817,14)union with my(1357,11)was one of horror and
dismay. I w(1623,9)by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled
and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not
impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival
with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the
ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with
his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from
(375,8)expected peace.

I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
England or entering(343,8)long correspondence with those philosophers
of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable
use to me in my(1733,9)undertaking. The latter method of obtaining
the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I
had an insurmountable aversion to (895,12)engaging(474,8)in my
loathsome task in(1140,10)’s house while in habits of familiar
intercours(375,13)I loved. I knew(1399,8)thousand fearful
accident(868,8)occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to
thrill all connected with me with horror(1090,8)aware(657,8)at I
should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the
harrowing sensations tha(1623,8)possess me during the progress of my
unearthly occupation.(992,8)absent(919,8)from all(361,8) while thus
employed. Once commenced, i(1766,8)quickly be achieved, and I might be
restor(1672,11)mily in peace and(1889,10). My(1413,9)(1393,9),
(1143,12)would(1149,8)for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some(548,9) might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my
slavery(119,10)

These feelings dictated my(1983,8)(1920,12). I expressed a wish to
visit England, but conceal(484,8)true reasons of this request, I
clothed my desires under a gu(1748,10)excited no suspicion, while I
urg(67,12) with an earnestness that easily induced(1004,10) to
comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that
resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find
that I was capable of taking pleasure in(1241,13)such a(1586,8),
and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would,(1801,8)my
return, have (782,9)me entirely to myself.

The duration of my abs(1492,9)left to my own choice; a few months, or
at most a year, was the(389,8)contemplated. One paternal kind
precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without
previously communicating(1358,8), he had, in concert with Elizabeth,
arrang(382,8)Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered
with the solitude I coveted for(1344,8)secu(371,11)task; yet at the
(1278,8)ment of my(553,8) the presence of my friend could in no way be
an impediment, and truly I rejoic(620,8)thus I(237,8)be saved many
hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between
me and the intrus(626,10)foe. If I were alone, would he not at times
force his abhorred(270,11)n me to remind m(289,8)task or to
(651,11) its(1741,9)?

To(1299,10)therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union
(600,14)(577,8)take place immediately on my return. M(1466,8)’s
age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one
reward I(1768,8)d(1932,13)my detested toils—one consolation for my
unparalleled sufferings;(269,8)(728,8)pect of that day when,
enfranchised(122,9)miserable slavery,(1993,9)claim(324,11)and
forget the past in(371,9) with her.

I now made arrangements for(839,11), but on(1868,9) haunted me
which filled me with fear and agitation. During(1333,12)(835,8)
leave(925,10)s unconscious of the exist(968,8)their enemy and
unprotect(306,8)his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my
departure. But(1367,8)(517,9)to follow me wherever(383,9)go, and
(899,14)ccompany me t(812,9)? This imagination was dreadful in
itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety(1246,13)s.
I was agonised (1387,9)(1874,8)the possibility(1241,8)e reverse of
this might happen. But through the whol(1722,9)during which I(1752,8)
slav(1406,8)creature I allow(867,10)to be governed by the impulses of
the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimat(1461,10)e fie(425,9)(466,10)and exempt my family from the danger of his
machinations.

It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native
country. M(1721,10)had been my own suggestion, and(1930,10)
(1405,9) acquiesced, but she was(924,8)with disqui(1852,9)(527,8)
my(1193,10), away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had
been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man
is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s
sedulous attention. She longed to bid me haste(1624,11);(118,11)
conflicting emotions(1640,11)er mute as she bade me a tearful, silent
farewell.

I threw(1626,8)into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly
knowing whither I was going, and careless of w(80,8)passing around.
I remembered only(1970,13)with a bitter anguish(715,8)reflected on
it, to ord(748,8)my chemical instruments(2014,8)be packed to go with
me. F(682,12)reary(1323,12)s, I passed(1156,9)many beautiful
and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could
only think(1660,8)bourn(1219,8)travels and the work which(438,8)occupy
me whilst they endured.

After some days spent in listless indolence,(1365,16)traversed
many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for
Clerval. He came. Alas, how gre(648,8)he contrast between us! He
was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beautie(2011,8)
setting sun, and more happy(60,9)beheld it rise and recommence a new
day. He pointed out to me the shifting colour(126,8) landscape and
the appearanc(163,9) sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;
“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, w(1482,10)re
you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
thoughts and neither(388,9)descent(738,8)evening star nor the golden
sunrise(1013,11)in the Rhine. And(215,9)friend, w(1001,8)far more
amus(1670,8)the journal of(1545,8), who observed the scenery with an
eye of feel(277,8)delight, than(837,8)ening to my(1196,8)ions. I, a
miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
enjoyment.

We had agreed to descend(291,10) in a boat from(927,11) to
Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this
voyage we(1309,8)many willowy islands and saw several(1333,10) towns.
We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from
(1147,12)(1170,11)Mainz. The course(1371,8)Rhine below Mainz
becomes much more picturesque. The river(360,8)s rapidly and winds
(1190,8)hills, not high, but steep, and of(264,11)forms. We saw
many ruined castles standing(267,8)edges of precipices, surrounded by
black woods, high and inaccessible. This par(910,9)Rhine, indeed,
presents a singularly variegated(1219,10). In one spot you view
rugged(270,8)(213,15)overlooking tremendous(211,13)with
the dark Rhine rushing beneath;(547,12)sudden turn of a promontory,
flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river
and populous towns occupy(1080,10).

We travelled at the tim(638,9)vintage and heard the song(1566,10)bourers
as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits
continually agitat(1462,12)(1244,8)s, even I was pleased. I lay at the
bottom(1736,8)boat, and as I gaze(948,9)cloudless blue sky, I seemed to
drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these
were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had
been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most(1296,11)scenes
of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the
snowy mountains(1569,9)almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black
and impenetrable shades, which would cause a(594,8)and mournful appearance
were it not for (267,9)verdant(1595,9)that relieve the eye by their gay

up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what(304,10)-spout must be
on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the ba(1695,10)(437,8),
(463,9) priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and(71,10)ir dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the
nightly wind(375,16)(186,10)s of La Valais,(255,9)Pays de Vaud;
but this(748,8), Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The
(116,13)Switzerland are more majestic and(1091,8), but there is a
charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.
Look at that castle which overhangs yon(1984,10)(543,8)at also on the
island,(946,8)concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now
that group of(1632,10) coming from among their vin(63,8)that village
half hid(297,8)reces(541,8)(1134,9). Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits
and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than(523,8)ho
pile the glacier or retire(1239,8)inaccessible pea(477,8)(690,14)
our(1404,12).”

Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and
to dwell(1823,8)praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a
being forme(392,9)“very poetry of nature.” His wild and
enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His
soul overflowed with ardent affections,(1202,9)friendship was of that
devoted and wondrous nature t(1382,9)orldly-minded teach us to look for only
in the(219,12). But even human sympathies were not sufficient to
satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature(1806,8)others regard
only with admiration, he lov(309,11)our:—

    ——The sounding cataract
    Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,
    T(1612,12)(1667,9)deep and(1962,8)wood(48,9)ir colours(1715,8)ir forms, were then to him
    An appetite; a feeling, and a love(140,8)at had no need of a remoter charm,
    By thought supplied, or any interest
    Unborrow’d from the eye.

          [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]

And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and(1374,8)being lost
for ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas,(887,12)s fanciful
and magnificent(589,8)formed a world, whose existence depended(1587,8)life of its creator;—h(152,12) perished? Does it now only exist
in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your(1564,8)still visits and
consoles your unhappy friend.

Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual(1415,8)re but a slight
tribut(1575,9)unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,
(1284,8)(239,9)the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will
proce(1348,8)my tale.

Beyond Cologne we descended(1753,8)plains of Holland; and we resolved to
post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary(1076,9)stream of
the river was too(798,8)to aid us.

Our journey here l(129,8)(962,8) arising from beautiful(1376,8), but we
arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.
It was on a clear morning,(1861,8)latter days of December, that I first saw
the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;
they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was mark(1963,9)
(605,12)of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish
Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard
of even in my country.

At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering
above all(1747,10)Tower famed in English history.




Chapter 19


London was our(410,8) point of rest; we determined to remain several
months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the
intercourse(557,8)men of genius and talent who flourished at this
time(1183,8)is was with me a secondary object; I was principally
occupi(1150,8)the means of obtaining the information necessary(1085,8)
completion of my promise and quickly availed myself(800,8)letters of
introduction(887,8)had brought(219,8), address(1290,10)most
distinguished natural philosophers.

If this(1186,10)ad taken place during my(1034,9)study and happiness,
it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had
come over my(2006,10), and I only visited these people(1457,9)sake(1429,8)(414,12)they might give me on the subject in which my(1428,9)
was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I
could fill my min(599,11)sights of heaven and earth; the voice of
Henr(1897,8)d m(273,9)could thus cheat(583,8)into a transitory
peace. But busy, un(1658,8)ing, joyous faces(604,9)back despair to
(2019,8). I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my
fellow men; this(50,9)was seal(887,12)blood of William and
Justine, and to reflect(464,8)events connect(965,10)ose names filled
my soul with anguish.

But in(1180,9)I(1431,9)image of my former self; he was inquisitive
and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of
manner(1612,8)he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
(95,11) and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long
had in view. His design(132,8)visit India, in the belief tha(75,8)
in his knowledge of its various languages, and(73,8)views(67,8)taken(56,8)society,(1435,14)materially assist(1446,8)progress of
European coloniza(289,9)trade. In Britain only could he further the
execu(1497,8)his plan(345,9)for ever busy(1939,10)only check to his
enjoyments was my sorrow(1841,8)dejected mind. I tried to conceal this
as much as possible,(1578,8)might not debar him from th(1416,10)s
(1560,8)to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by
any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,
alleging another engagement(213,15)remain alone. I now also
began to collect the(542,9)s(1961,15)my new creation(431,8)is
was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling
on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme
anguish, and every word(483,8)spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
to quiver, and (1483,8) to palpitate.

After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in
Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the
beauties(876,8)native country and asked us if those were not sufficient
allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,
where he resided.(1580,9)eagerly desir(734,9)ept this invit(614,11)I,
although I abhorred(1246,10)wished to view again mountains and streams and
all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.

We had arrived in England at the beginning of Octob(602,8)it was now
February. We accordingly determin(1230,8)mmence(382,13)towards the
north(122,8)expira(1406,8)(1063,8)month. In this expedition we did not
intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but(1765,10)Windsor, Oxford,
Matlock(1504,10)Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive(319,8)completion of
this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and
(1258,14)I had(1286,8)ed(145,15)finish my labours in some
obscure nook(2007,8)northern highlands of (995,8).

We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at
(355,9)rambling in its beautiful forest. This was(1686,13)to us
(801,8)eers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game(1958,10)herds of
stately deer were all novelties to us.

From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds
were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
there more than a centu(1321,8) half before. It was here that Charles
I.(571,14) his forces. T(192,8) ha(461,11)faithful to him,
after the whole nation(1546,8)saken his cause to join the standard of
Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his
companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and
son, gave a peculiar interest to every part(430,8)city which they
might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a
(1455,8) here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these
feelings had not(90,8)n imaginary gratification, the appea(654,8)
(224,9)had yet in itself(1909,11) beauty to obtain our admiration.
The colleges are anci(494,8)picturesque; the streets are almost
magnificent;(1421,9)lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows
of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,
which reflects its(1153,10)assemblage of towers, and spires, and
domes, embosomed among aged trees.

I enjoy(1102,8)scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
(832,12)e past(1742,9)anticip(1896,9)the future. I was formed
for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never
visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what
i(1579,12)in nature or the study(44,8) is excell(1113,8)sublime in
the productions of man could always(1016,10)my heart and communicate
elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has
(1583,8)my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what
I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,
pitiable to others and intoler(26,8)myself.

We passed a considerable period at Oxford(2027,11)among its environs
and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most
animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery
were often prolonged by the successive objec(1950,8)presented
themselves. We (753,8)the tomb(2011,8)illustrious Hampden(1232,8)
field on(1613,9)at patriot fell. For a moment(564,8) was elevated
from its debas(1824,8)(517,10)fears to contemplate the divine ideas
of(1924,8) and self-sacrifice of(1775,10)se sights were the monuments
(1449,8)remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains
and look around me with a free and loft(891,8), but the iron had eaten
into my flesh, and I sank again, tre(680,8)nd hopeless, into my
(842,11)(771,9)lef(744,8) with regret and proceeded to Matlock(1704,8)was our next
place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village
resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but
everything is on a lower scale,(1904,9)green hills want the crown of
distant white Alps which(1357,8)attend on the piny mountains of my
nativ(253,9)(840,17)wondrous cave(1733,9)little cabinets
of natural(1019,8), wh(669,8)curiosities are disposed(362,8)same
manner as(384,8)collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name
made me tremble when pronounced by Henry(652,8)hastened to quit
(564,10)ith(1045,12)terrible scene was thus associated.

From Derby, still journeying northwards, w(1482,9)two months in
Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the
Swiss(490,10). T(436,10)patches of snow which yet lingere(559,8)
northern sides(1357,8)(576,9), the lakes(687,10)dashing of the
rocky streams were all familiar and dear(1232,8)to me. Here also we
made some acquaintances, who(264,8)contrived to cheat me into
happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably(974,9)than
mine; his mind expand(702,10)company of men of talent, and he found
in his own nature(1075,9)capacities and resources than he could have
imagined himself to have possessed while he(666,11) with his
inferiors. “(592,8)pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among
thes(518,11) I should scarcely(1423,8)(1267,11)(1230,9)Rhine.”

But(283,9) that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain
amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever(1287,8)stretch; and
when he begins to sink into repose, he finds(373,9)oblig(1077,11)that on which he rests in pleasure for something new(1686,8)again
engages his attention, and(1489,9)so he forsakes for other novelties.

We ha(396,11)(1483,12)various lakes of (1133,26)
and conceived an affection(202,9)(1041,8)inhabitants when the period
of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them
to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my
promis(395,10) time(1545,8)feared the effect(1265,9)dæmon’s
dis(200,11). He might remain in(755,17)wreak his vengeance
on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment
from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited
for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was
miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and(548,9)y arrived and I
saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to
read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend
follow(386,10)might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
When these(106,8)s(1441,11)me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,
but (147,9)him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of
his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the
consciousness of(1258,8)aunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed
drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.

I(1237,9)Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
have interes(1315,8)most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well
as Oxford, for the antiquity(1320,8)latter city was more pleasing to him.
But the beauty and regular(75,11)new town of(261,10), its romantic
castle and its environs,(232,10)delightful in the world, Arthur’s
Seat, St. Bernard’s Well,(2001,9)Pentland Hills, compensated him for
the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was
(1166,8)t to arrive at the termina(1071,8)my journey.

We left(556,11)in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and
along the bank(1564,9)Tay, to Perth, where our(1750,8)expected us.
(204,9) in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into
their feelings or plans with the good humour(126,10)from a guest; and
accordingly I told(740,9)that I wished to make the tour of Scotl(278,8)e. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our
rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with
my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short
time(1695,11)I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more
congenial to your own temper.”

Henry(346,11)dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceas(1767,8)monstrate. He(246,8)ed me to write often. “I had rather(193,8)
you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than(608,9)se Scotch
people, whom I(413,8)know; hasten, then, my dea(788,8), to(350,8)
that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in
your absence.”

Having par(763,9)my(125,9)I determined to visit some remote spot of
(742,8) and finish my work in(583,9). I(1559,9)doubt but that the
monster(1992,10)me and would discover himself to me(644,8)should have
finished, that he might receive his companion.

With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of
th(285,8)st(1742,8)Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place
fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were
continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely
affording pastur(1042,8)few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its
inhabitants(667,8)consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs
gave token(1628,8)ir(133,11)fare. Vegetables and bread, when they
indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from
the mainland(886,8)was about five miles distant.

On the whole island there were but three(346,11)hut(346,8)(616,9)se was vacant(1420,8)arrived. This I hired. It contained but two
rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidnes(1992,9)most(500,10)
penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered(124,9)
door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
furniture, and took possession, an incident(422,8)ould doubtless have
occasioned some surprise had not(282,10)ense(277,9)cottagers been
benumbed by wa(710,8)qualid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at
and unmolested,(1013,8)thanked for the pittance of food and clothes
(1541,8)gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations
of men.

In(1321,8)treat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
(902,8) weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach(1359,8)sea to
listen to(1222,10) as they roared and dashed at my feet(1388,10)
monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was
far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills
are covered with vin(1163,8)its(607,8)s are scattered thickly in the
plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when
troubled(1561,9)inds, their tumult is but(1738,8)play of a lively
inf(1164,9)compared(418,8)roaring(1096,9)giant ocea(601,12)manner I distributed my occupations(2035,8)first(1265,8), but
as I proceeded in(1892,10), it became every day more horrible and
irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my
laboratory for several days, and at other (90,8)toiled day and night
in order to complete my work(709,8), indeed, a filthy process in(1023,9)was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of
enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me(890,8)horror of my employment; my
mind was intently fix(989,10)consummation of(429,12)and my eyes
were shut(115,21)proceedings. But now I went to it in
cold blood(91,9)heart often sickened at the work of my hands.

Thus situated, employed(1245,8)most detestable(688,11), immersed in
a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from
the actual scene in (492,19), my spirits(763,8)unequal; I
grew restless and nervous. Every moment I fe(969,8)meet my
persecutor(803,14)sat with(444,8)(496,14)ground, fearing
to raise them lest they should encounter the objec(1980,8)I(1741,8)
dreaded to behold.(177,13)wander(1431,8)e sight of my fellow
creatures lest when alone he(139,8)come to claim his companio(1814,9)e mean time I worked on(715,9)labour was already considerably
advanced. I looked towards its(1026,8)ion with a tremulous and eager
hope,(524,9)dared not trust(1196,11)question bu(339,8)was
intermix(1671,8)obscure forebod(1471,8)evil that made(845,10)sicken
in my bosom.




Chapter 20


I sat one evening(1447,11)ratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just
rising(477,11)ea; I had not sufficient light for(1189,14), and I
remained idle, in a pause of(422,10)(1191,8)whether I(681,8)leave(1530,8)ur for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting(1000,10)
to it. As I sat, a train of(2001,8)ion occur(924,9) which l(1440,8)
(609,8) the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was
engag(1261,10)same(1962,8)and had created a fiend whose unparalleled
barbarity had desolate(1421,11)and filled it for ever with the bitterest
remorse.(197,11)about to form another being of whose dispositions I was
alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her
mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had
sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she
had not; and she, who in all probability was to(245,8)a thinking and
reasoning animal, might refuse to comply(1180,8)compact made before her
creation. They might even hate each other; the (1435,8) who(1334,9)lived
loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
for it when it cam(179,10)is eyes(2022,8)female form? She also might turn
with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man(626,12)quit him,
and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provoc(1187,9)being
deserted by one of(303,9)species.

Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the(612,8) of the new world,
yet(105,8)the first resul(47,8)ose sympathies for which the dæmon
thirsted would be children, and a race of devils(40,10)propagated upon
the earth wh(423,8)make the very existenc(179,9)species(867,9)
condition precari(1905,8)full of terror. Had I r(1015,10)my own benefit,
to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had(833,8)been moved
by the sophism(395,9)being I(1425,12)(1809,8)been struck senseless by
his fiendish threats; but now,(1740,9)first time, the wickedness of my
promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me
as their pest, whose selfishness(2019,9)hesitated to buy(1388,9)peace at
the price, perhaps,(697,8)(509,17)whole human race.

I trembled an(1707,11)failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by
the light(822,8)moon(757,10) at the casement. A ghastly grin
wrinkled his lips as he gazed o(131,9)re I sat fulfilling the task
which he had allotted to me. Yes,(28,8)followed me in my travels; he
had loitered in forests, hid(1676,12)caves, or taken refuge in wide
and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the
fulfilment of my promise.

As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of
malice and treachery. I thought(1774,8)sens(1403,9)madness on(790,12)of creating another like to him,(100,8)mbling with passion,
tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me
destroy(1878,14)on whose(907,8)(1294,10)he depended for
happiness, and(2022,8)howl(1416,9)ish despair and revenge, withdrew.

I left the room, and lock(679,8)door, made a solemn vow in my own
heart never to resume my labours; and then, with(341,11)steps, I
sought(1441,8)apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate
the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression(1023,10)st
terrible reveries.

Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;
it was almost motionless(1489,10)winds were hush(102,8)all nature
reposed under the ey(2012,9)quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone
specked the water, and now(425,9) the gentle breeze wafted the sound
of voices as the fishermen called to one(861,8). I felt the silence,
althoug(816,8)hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear
was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a
person landed close to my house.

In a few minutes after, I heard(972,9)king of my door, as if some one
endeavoured to open it softly. (1763,11)from head to foot;(327,8)a
presenti(1388,8)who (614,8)nd wished to rouse on(1879,9)peasants who
dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome(350,8)(1388,9)
of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain(284,10) to fly from an impending dang(695,8)was rooted to the spot.

Presently(414,13)sound of footsteps along the passage;(1273,9)
open(1006,8)t(1475,10)whom I dreaded appeared. Shutt(1339,14)he
approached me and said in a smothered voice,

“You have destroy(940,8)ork which you began; what is it that you
intend? Do you dare to break your(1940,8)? I have endured toil and misery;(1568,8)Switzerl(1643,9)you; I crept(322,11)shores(1363,8)Rhine, among
its willow islands and over the summit(1010,9)hills.(160,8)dwelt many
months in the heaths of England and am(467,8)deserts of Scotland(85,8)
(245,8)incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; d(339,11)(1986,8)my
hopes?”

“Begone! I d(370,8)my(368,8); never will I creat(1313,9) like
yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”

“Slave, I before reasone(423,10), but y(596,8)proved (103,8)
unworthy of my condescension. Remember that(557,8)power; you believ(182,10) miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of
day will be hateful to you. You are my creator(97,8)am your master;
obey!”

“The hour of my irresolution is past(985,10)period of your power is
arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of(419,11); but
they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in
vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose
delight is in death and(407,9)ness? (709,10)am firm, and your
words will only exasperate my rage.”

The monster saw my(241,15)in my face and gnashed his teeth in the
impotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a
wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had
feelings of affection(1553,9)y were requited by detestation and scorn.
Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread(1426,11),
and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for
ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel(1388,8)intensity of my
(564,14)You can blast my other passions, but revenge
remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than(1052,8)r food! I may die, but
first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your
misery. Beware, for I am fearless(1066,8)refore powerful. I will watch with
the wiliness of a snake,(1349,8)may sting with its venom. Man, you shall
repent(1870,8)injuries you inflict.”

“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.
(1897,8)eclared my (1328,11)to you(804,8)am no coward to bend
beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”

“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be(1736,9)(427,9)wedding-night.”

I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my
death-warrant, be sure that you are(1838,9) safe.”

I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with
precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot
across the waters with an arrowy swiftn(703,8)was soon lost amidst the
waves.

All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to
pursue the murdere(1929,8)pe(1525,8)(257,10)e him into the ocean. I
walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination
conjured up a thousand images to(1073,8) and sting me. Why had I not
followed him and clos(247,8)him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him
to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered
to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate(1428,8).
And then I thought again of(512,10)—“_I wi(924,17)
your (924,14)_” That, then, was the period fixed for the
fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and
extinguish his(1251,8) The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I
(262,8)of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she
should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I
had shed for many months, stream(64,8)my eyes(1461,8)resolved not to fall
before my enemy without a bitter struggle.

The night passed away,(1816,8) sun rose from(966,10); my feelings became
calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into
the depths of despair. I left(1393,10), the horrid scene(1878,8)last
night’s contention, and walked on the beach(1934,8)sea(1419,8)I
almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between(1562,8)my fellow
creatures; nay, a wish that such(760,8)prove the fact stole across me. I
desired that I m(435,9) my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,
but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to
be(1157,12)or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a
dæmon(49,8)had myself created.

I(440,8)about the isle like a restless spectre, separat(889,8)all it
loved and miserable in the(49,8)ion. When it became no(573,8)the
(789,9)higher, I lay down(598,8)gra(1951,11)overpowered by a deep
sleep. I had been awake the whol(718,9)preceding night, my nerves
were agitated,(638,8)eyes inflamed by watching(249,10)y. The sleep
into(759,8) now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as
if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself(1223,8)began to
reflect upon what had(1179,8)with greater composure; yet still the
words(1033,8)fiend rang in my ears(564,8)death-knell; they appeared
(34,8)ream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.

The sun had far descend(413,8)I still sat(1153,8)shore,(1771,8)ing my
appetite(1166,8)had become ravenous, with an oaten cake,(419,8)saw a
fishing-boat land close to me, and o(1333,10)men brought me a packet;
it contained letters from Geneva(74,10)from Clerval entreating me to
join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where
he was, that(142,14)the friends he had formed in London desired
his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his
Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as
his journey to(170,8)might be followed, even sooner than he now
conjectured, by his(120,8)voyage, he(400,8)ed me to bestow as much of
my society on him as I could spare. He bes(550,8), therefore, to
leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we(1745,8)roceed
southwards together. This letter in a degree recall(215,9)life, and
I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.

Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on(1353,9)shuddered
to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I
must enter the room(1059,13)en the scene of my odious work(1392,8)must
handl(1964,8)utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next
morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door
of my laborato(1699,8)remain(1490,9)half-finished creature, whom I had
destroyed, lay scattered(1949,8)floor(1659,8)almost(1733,8) if I had
mangled the living flesh of a(1745,12). I paused to collect myself and
then(1088,9)the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the(532,12)
out(1752,8)room, but I(603,8)ed that I ought not to leave the relics of my
work to excite the horror and suspic(787,8)he peasants;(310,8)ccordingly
put them into a basket(1695,8) great quantity of stones, and laying them
up,(946,15)throw(93,11)the sea that very night; and in the
meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my
(916,9)apparatus.

Nothing could be more(1596,12)an the alter(1600,8)at had taken place
in my feelings since the n(888,8)the appearanc(1953,9)dæmon. I had
before regarded my promise(377,9)loomy despair as a thing that, with
whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now(812,12)a film
(1148,10)aken from(1338,8)my eyes an(672,9)for the first time saw
clearly. The idea of renewing(1050,8)urs did not for one instant occur
to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts(843,8)did not
reflect that a voluntary act of min(2024,8)avert it. I had resolved in
my own mi(252,8)to create another like the fiend I had first made
w(620,8)an(125,8)the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I
banished from my mind ever(258,9) that could lead to a different
conclusion.

Between two and three in the morning the moon rose(1079,8)then, putting my
basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.
T(1782,9)was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,
but I(125,8)away(109,9)m. I(1579,14)was about the commission of a
dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my
fellow(1775,9)s. At one time(364,9), which had(895,8)been clear, was
suddenly overspread by a thick cloud(1819,8)took advantag(1158,9)moment of
darkness and cast my basket(1455,13); I liste(1494,9)e gurgling sound
as it sank and then(385,21) spot. The sky became clouded, but
the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then
rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations
that I(1050,10)to prolong my stay on the water, and fix(839,8)rudder in a
direct position, stretched myself at the bottom(1072,9)oat. Clouds hid the
moon, everything was obscure(516,8)heard only the sound(85,12) as its
keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me,(1971,8)a short time I
slept soundly.

I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I
fou(1413,9)he sun had already mounted considerab(1673,8)wind was high, and
(219,9) continually threatened the safety of my(1239,13). I found
(142,9)(100,9)(658,10)and must have driven me far(1275,10)coast from
which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly(150,12)if I again made the attemp(606,8)at (1692,9)instantly(788,8)with
water. Thu(413,8)ed, my only resource was to drive(1206,8)(277,8). I
confess that(1406,9) few(867,11) of terror(1927,8)no compass with me
and was so slenderly acquaint(1426,8)the geography of this par(1915,8)
worl(586,15)was of(1725,8)benefit to me. I might b(455,9)(1308,8)
wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in
the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me(307,8)already
been out many hours and felt(152,8)ment of a b(1859,8)hirst, a prelude to
my other sufferings. I looked(1269,8)heavens(1725,8)were covered by clouds
that flew(548,16), only to be replaced by others;(112,10)upon the
sea; it(635,8)be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your
task is(1078,9)fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and
of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his
sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so
despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is(1714,8)point of
closing(962,8)me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.

Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as(1466,9)declined towards the
horizon,(1362,10)died away(249,8)gentle(2030,8)and the sea became
free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell;(1178,8)sick
and hardly able to hold(1997,11), when suddenly I saw a line of high
lan(227,13) south.

Almost spent, as I was, by fatigu(221,10)dreadful suspense I endured
for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of
warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.

How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have
(161,8)even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a
(1512,8)my dress and eagerly steered(1853,11)(412,12)land. It had a
wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived
the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself
(620,9)transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I
carefully traced(1960,9)ings of(265,9) and hailed a steeple which I at
length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of
extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly(846,13)town, as a place
where I could most(399,9)rocure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with
me. As I turned the(206,11) I(482,10)(237,9)neat town and a good
harbour(1821,8)I entered,(874,9) bounding with joy at my unexpected
escape.

(325,9)occupied in fixing the boat and arrang(23,8)sails,(1069,8)
people crowd(1414,14) spot. They seemed much surprised at my
(784,16)instead of offering me any assistance, whispered
together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me
a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they
spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My
good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of
this(579,10)inform me (730,8)am?”

“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.
“Maybe you are come to(844,8) that will not prove much to your taste,
but y(143,8)not be consulte(234,8)your quarters, I promise you.”

I was exceedingly(623,11)on receiving so rude an answer from a
stranger(445,8)was also disconcerted on(1432,8)(815,8)frowning and
angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you(133,8)me so
roughly?” I(384,8). “Surely it is not the custom of(629,8)men to
receive(1845,8)rs so inhospitably.”

“I do not know(620,8)the man, “wha(102,16)the
English may b(950,8)t is(44,18) Irish to hate villains.”

While this(2010,9)dialogue continued,(1311,13)the crowd rapidly
increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and ange(1357,8)
annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquir(1776,8)ay(1842,8)inn, but
no one(439,10)I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the
crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man
approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must
follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”

“Who is(55,11)? Why am I(63,23)myself? Is not
this a free country?”

“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.(176,11) is a magistrate,
and(1205,9)(203,22)the death of a gentleman who was
found murdered here last night.”

This(1123,8)startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;
that could easily be proved; accordingly I(557,10)my conductor in silence
and was led to one(946,8)best houses in the town(143,8)ready to sink from
fatigue and hunger, but being(683,12)by a crowd, I thought it politic
to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility migh(1580,9)trued into
apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did(933,8)expect the calamity that
was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair
all fear of ignominy or death.

I must pause here, for it requires(284,8)fortitude to recall the memory of
the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my
recollection.




Chapter 21
(1909,8)soon introduced into the presenc(609,9)(899,11) an old
benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,
with(1468,13)of severity, and then, turning towards(805,13)s,
he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.

About half a dozen men came(1528,8); and, one(796,8)elected by the
(283,12)he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with
his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when,(525,8)en o’clock,
they observed a strong northerly blast rising(352,9)y(1163,13)put in
for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did
not land at the harbour, bu(70,9)y(300,10)accustomed, at a creek about
two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a par(1561,9)(385,9)ackle,
and his companions(1972,10)him at some distance. As he was proceeding
along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his
length(2027,8)ground. H(159,14)came up to assist him, an(657,9)ligh(1802,8)ir lantern they foun(668,14)fallen(117,8)body of a man,
who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the
corpse of some person who(803,10)drowned (1769,8)thrown on shore(882,8)waves, but on examinatio(228,18)the clothes were not wet and even
(39,9)body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage
of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it
to life. It(1227,10)to be a handsome young ma(1032,9)five and twenty
years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of
any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.

The first(903,11)is de(556,9)did not in the least interest me, but
when the(111,9)the(115,9)was mentioned I remembered the murder of
my(1369,8)(893,8)t myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a
mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for
support. T(1884,13)(1465,10)me with a keen eye and of course drew
an unfavourable augury from my manner.

The son confirmed his father’s account, but when(1646,14) was
called he swore positively that jus(1741,9)the fall of(1373,14), he
saw a boat,(228,8)single man in it, at a short(1403,9) from the shore;
and as far as he could judg(1067,8) (1292,9)a few stars,(1174,11) same
boat in which I had just landed.

A woman(2014,14)she lived(1004,10)beach(1216,9)standing(1782,8)door
of her(1079,8), waiting(895,8) return(1713,12)erm(2030,10)an hour
before she heard(1762,8)discovery(1779,8)body, when she (383,10) with
only on(382,11) push off(370,8)a(957,12)e shore where the corpse
was afterwards found.

Another woma(642,12)the(633,8)(236,17) having brought the
body into her house;(1631,8)not(1454,12)put it into a bed and
rubbed it, and(739,8)wen(1482,9)town for an apothecary, but life was
quite gone.

Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed
th(781,9)the strong north wi(1969,9)ad arisen during the night, it
was very probable that I had beaten(1578,8)or many hours and(1924,9)
(1213,8)to(650,8)nearly(1775,8)same spot from(819,13)departed.
Besides, they(1238,10)that i(1749,12)(161,11)(492,10) body
from another place, and(957,8)lik(1149,9)as I(1608,9)appear to know
(1073,9), I might have put into the harbour ignora(658,10)(1148,8)
of(546,10)of ——(1166,10)plac(783,8)(264,9)osited(799,11).

Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desi(283,11)should be taken into
the room(901,11)body lay for interment,(371,9)might b(1635,11)what
effect the s(1323,8)it would produce upon me. This idea was(615,8)y
suggested(1398,8)extreme agitation I had exhibited (1999,10)ode of the
murder(651,9) described. I was accordingly conducted,(1516,8)(1864,10)
and s(924,13)persons,(1004,8)inn. I could not help being struck by the
strange coincidences(913,10)taken place(918,10)is eventful night; but,
knowing(920,14)en conversing with(187,9)persons in the island I had
inhabited about the time tha(838,10)(333,10)found, I was perfectly
tranquil as(1287,8)consequences(1671,8)affair.

I entered (645,19)corpse lay(1795,9)led up(91,10)ffin. How
can I(484,9) my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with
horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and
agony. Th(1471,8)ation, the presenc(681,8)(618,11) and witnesses,
passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry
Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath(1621,8)rowing myself on
(1360,8), I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you
also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other
victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my
benefactor—”

The human frame(966,9) longer support the agoni(946,8)I endured, and
I was carried ou(1528,9)room in(1930,8)convulsions.

A fever succeeded to this. I(1411,9)two months on the point of death; my
ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called(479,8)(1333,10)er of William, of Justine, and of(345,8). Sometimes I entreated my
attendants to assist me(1150,8)destruction(1823,8)fiend by whom I was
tormented; and at others I felt the finger(1117,9)monster(571,9)grasping
my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke
my native language, (1937,10) alone understood me; but my gestures and
bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other(1055,10).

Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, w(60,12)
sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming
children, the only hop(1526,9)ir doting parents; how many brides and
youthful lovers have been one day(1728,8)bloom of health and hope(1212,8)e
next a prey for worms(30,8) decay(1682,8)tomb! Of what materials was I
made(1895,8)could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of
the wheel, continually renewed the torture?

But I was doomed to live and in(1045,12)foun(968,9)as awaking from
a dream, in a prison,(1547,11)on a w(1561,10)d, surrounded by
gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all th(629,12)apparatus of a dungeon.
It was morning, I remember,(1736,8)thus awoke to(834,8)anding; I had
forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some
great misfortune had suddenly overwhelme(958,10)when I looked around
and(1918,9)barred window(618,10)squalidnes(1189,9)(1555,8)which I
was, all flashed across(2025,11)and I groaned bitterly.

This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside
me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one(818,9)(524,9)and her
countenance expresse(543,8)ose bad qualities which often characterise
that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude(878,9)at of
persons accust(828,8)see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her
ton(203,12)her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,
(1136,8)voice struck me as on(1111,9)had heard during my sufferings.

“Are you better now, sir?” said she.

I replied(1896,8)sam(1701,12)with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;
but if it be all true, if indeed I did not(1115,8)I am sorry(1320,8)am
still alive to feel this misery and horror.”

“For that matter,”(204,9)the(719,10), “if you mean about the
gentleman you murdered, (222,10)that it were(328,8)for you if you
were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none
of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty
with a safe conscience;(194,9)well if everybody did(502,9).”

I turned with loath(1559,8) the(1056,11)could utter so unfeeling a
speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt
languid and unable to reflect on all t(1470,8)passed. The whole series
of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted(701,11)it
wer(729,12)for it never presented itself to my mind with the force
of reality.

As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew
feverish; a darkness (1352,9)round me; no one was near me who soothed
me(168,10)gent(1001,8) of love; no dear hand supported me. The
physician came and prescribed medicines,(1761,9)(1643,10)prepared
them for(1853,9)utter carelessness was visible(1199,8)first(89,9)
expression of brutality was strongly mark(1265,10)visag(1702,8)
second. W(739,9)be interest(1318,10)fate of a(1079,8)r but the
hang(1861,9)ould gain his fee?

These were my first(728,8)ions, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had
shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room(1512,8)prison
to be(390,9) for me (wretched(1472,8)was(71,9)); and it was he who
had provided a (530,10)and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to
see me, for although he ardently desired to r(1442,9)e(1783,11) of
every human creature, he(1666,9)wish (248,9)sent at the agonies and
miserable ravings(495,14). He came, therefore,(1094,11)to see
that I was not neglected, but his visits were short a(1080,8)long
intervals.

One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes
half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom
and(1954,12)often(1450,8)ed I had(1854,8)seek death than desire to
remain in a world which to me was replete with (674,8)ness. At one time I
considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the
penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such(996,8)
thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and(1007,12)entered.
His countenance ex(1519,8)sympathy and compassion; he drew(514,8) close to
mine and addressed me in French,

“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to
make you more comfortable?”

“I thank you, but(2008,10)you mention is no(82,8) me; on t(2029,8)
earth there is no(103,8) which I am capable of receiving.”

“I know(230,8)e(331,10)of a stranger can be but of little relief to
one borne down as you are by so(72,8) a misfortune. But you will, I
hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can
easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”

“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of(210,9)events, become
the most (1347,10)of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and
have been, can death be any evil to me?”

“Nothing(1705,8)(1972,9)more unfortunate and agonising than the
(407,8)chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some
surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,
seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was
presented to your eyes(1981,10)ody of your friend,(1745,8)d in so
unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were(258,9) fiend across
your path.”

As(1225,12)said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on
this retrospect of my(2039,11), I also felt (1534,8)able surprise at
the knowledge he seemed to possess(753,8)ing me. I suppose some
astonish(1454,9)exhibited in my(1435,12), for(1476,12)hastened
to say,

“I(495,10) upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on
your person wer(1013,10)me, and I examined them that I might discover some
trace by(1333,9)could sen(593,10)relations an account(596,9)(1241,10)
and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one(1461,8)
(159,8)ed from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote
to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.
(1460,8)are ill; even now you tremble;(1535,9)unfit for(735,11)of any
kind.”

“This suspense is a thousand times worse(1207,9) most horrible event;
tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am
now to lament?”

“Your family is perfectly well,” said(998,12)with
gentleness; “and someone, a(1149,9)is come to visit you.”

I know not by what chain of thought the idea (1270,10)itself, but it
(516,10)darted into my mind(2031,10)murderer had(143,9)mock at my
misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for
me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,
and cried out in agony,

“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not
let him enter!”

(1458,11)regarded(246,9)a troubled(1263,12). He could not help
regarding my exclamation as a presump(783,8)my guilt and said in
rather a severe tone,

“I should have(530,8), young man,(478,10)presence(1785,10)ather
w(64,10)been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”

“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed
from anguish to pleasure. “Is m(100,8) indeed come? How kind, how
very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”

My change of(2036,8)(1851,8)d and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he
(922,10)at my former(506,13)was a momentary return of delirium,
and now he(1478,11)resumed his(88,8)benevole(638,8)rose and
quitted the room with my nurse, and in(136,9)(350,11)entered it.

Nothing, at this moment, c(635,10)given me greater(440,9)(1450,9)
arrival of(455,10). I stretched o(1009,11)to him (1000,9),

“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”

(656,9) calm(953,12)ssurances of their welfa(668,8)ndeavoured, by
dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my
desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison(1203,8)be the abode of
cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”
said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and w(418,8)appearance
of(600,9). “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems
to pursue you. And poor(1604,8)—”

The name of my unfortunate and(1716,8)d friend was an agitation too
great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.

“Alas! Yes,(1143,10),” replied I; “some destiny of the
most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I
(1501,12)died on the coffin of Henry.”

We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the
precarious stat(368,8)health rendere(1464,8)precaution necessary that
could ensure tranquillity. (1868,11)came in and insisted(1326,8)
strength(1755,8)not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the
(675,10)(1130,13) was to me like that(1903,8)ood angel, and I
gradually recovered(269,10).

As my sickness (1384,8)me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black
melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of(790,8) was
for ever before me, ghastly(792,13). Mo(1413,8)once the(798,10)
into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous
relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a
life? It was(768,8)that I might(802,8)my(880,8), which is now
drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these
throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of a(66,9)at bears
me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also
sink to rest. Then the(1410,11) of death was distant, although the
wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours
motionless and speechless, wishing for som(282,9)revolution that
might bury me and(452,8)royer in its ruins.

The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months
in prison, and(275,10)I was still weak and in continual danger of a(725,8)(980,8)obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles(508,8)country
town where(23,8)rt was held(1303,14)harged himself with every
care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.(241,8)pared
the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not
brought(1145,8)(211,10)that decides on lif(999,8)ath. The grand
jury rejected the bill, on its being prov(1558,8)I was(1789,8)Orkney
Islands at the hour the body(1530,8)riend was found; and a fortnight
after my removal I was liberated from prison.

M(1614,13)enraptured on finding me fre(59,8)the vexations of a
(351,8) charge,(227,12)again(1984,12)breathe the fresh
atmosphere and permitted to return to my nativ(647,9). I did not
participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a
palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned (1722,8), and
(1198,12) sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I
saw around me(1870,9)but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by
no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared(168,8). Sometimes
they w(1006,8)expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark
orbs(1121,8)covered by the lids and the long black lash(160,8)fringed
them; s(158,8) it was the watery, clouded(160,9)the monster, as I
first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt(804,13)tried to awaken in(596,8)(620,8) of affection. He talked
of Geneva(2022,8)I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but
these words only drew deep groans from(445,14), indeed, I felt a
wish for happin(1802,8)thought with melancholy delight of my beloved
cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more
the blue lake and rapid Rhon(1096,8)had been so dea(970,8)in early
childhood; but my general state of(1034,8) was a torpor in which a
prison was as welcome a residence(1592,8)divinest scene in nature; and
these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and
despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the
existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance
to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.

Yet one duty remained to me, the re(2043,8)on of which finally
triumphed over my selfish (291,9)It was necessary(1882,8)should
return without delay to(903,9)there to watch over the liv(1079,8)ose
I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any
chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to
blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim,(546,14)
the (546,10)(1309,12)rous image(1186,9)had endued with the
mockery of a soul still mor(73,11). (1334,10)still desired to
delay our departure, fearful(453,8)could not sustain the fatigues of a
journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My
strength was gone.(75,9)mere skeleton, and fever night and day
prey(1850,9)y wasted frame.

Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,
m(1673,10)hought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel
bound for Havre-de-Grace and sail(498,8)a fair wind from the Irish shores.
It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening(667,8)dashing(1974,8)waves. I hailed the darkness that shut(326,9)from my
sight, and my pulse beat(212,9)everish joy when I reflected(1095,15)soon see Geneva. The past appear(1237,8) in the (1838,9)a frightful dream;
yet the vessel(1666,10)I was, the wind that blew(1401,9)the detested
shore of(574,8), and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
that I was deceived by no vision a(140,8)Clerval, my friend and dearest
companion, had fallen a victim to me(164,9)monster of my creation. I
repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing
with my family in(1525,12) death of my mother(555,9)(1168,9) for
Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on
to the(239,9) of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in
which he first lived(1201,8)unable to pursue the train of(1075,8); a
thousand feelings press(1220,9)e(138,8)wept bitterly.

Ever since my recovery(1049,10)fever, I had been(789,8)custom of taking
every(1352,8) small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug
onl(2043,9)was enabled to g(1592,8)rest necessary(1967,9)preserv(402,8)
life. Op(271,8)by the recollec(441,11)various misfortunes, I now
swallowed double my usua(225,11)and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did
not afford me respit(1042,9)ou(1670,8)misery; my dreams presented(495,12)object(1337,8)cared me. Towards morning I was poss(263,9)a kind
of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and(1996,11)free
myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. M(1785,8), who was
watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; (1637,12)waves
were around, the cloudy sky above,(226,10) was not here: a sense of
security, a(855,8) that a truce was established between(648,10)nt hour

forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly
susceptible.




Chapter 22


The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon
fou(1778,8)I had overtaxed my strength(1675,10)I must repose before I
could continue my journey(574,11)’s care and attentions were
indefatigable, but he did not know the origi(1470,8)sufferings and
sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to
seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not
(34,8)! They were my brethren, my fellow beings(1654,8)felt
attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an
angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But(1093,10)(513,9)no right
to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy(158,11) whose
joy(1601,8)to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they
would, each and all, abhor me and hunt m(1438,9)e world, did they know
my unh(1570,8)acts (1009,8)crimes which ha(167,8)source in me!

(1292,9) yielded at length to my desire to avoid(576,8) and strove by
(1730,8)arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he(1653,9)that I
felt deeply the degrad(1871,8) being obliged to answer a charge of
murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.

“Alas!(1572,11)” said I, “how little do you know me.
Human(772,9)their(1465,8)s and passions, would indeed b(231,8)ed if such
a wretch as(1813,8)pride. Justine, poor unhappy(22,10)was as innocent
as I, and she suffe(1006,8)same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause
of this—I murdered her. William,(156,10)and Henry—they all
died by my hands.”(634,12)had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make(193,9)
assertion; when I thus accused myself, he s(632,9)seemed to(730,8)an
explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of
delirium,(1635,9)(213,13)llness, some idea of this kind had(1982,8)ed
itself to my imagi(163,8)the remembrance(1936,10)I preserved in my
convalescence. I avoided (244,11) and maintained a(1786,8)al silence
concerning the(674,8)I had created(1351,8)a persuasion(1931,8)should be
supposed mad(294,8)is in itself would for ever have (1432,8)my tongue. But,
besides, I could not bring my(318,8)disclose a secret which(105,8)ill my
hearer with conster(286,13)ke fear and unnatural horror the inmates of
his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was
silent(735,8)would have given(1562,10) to have confid(2005,9)tal secret.
Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably
from me.(374,9)offer no(597,13)of them, but their truth in part
relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.

Upon this occasion m(1722,9)said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,
“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat
you never to make such an (1171,9) again.”

“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun(1986,9)heavens, who
have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.(1480,9)
assassin of those most(1582,9) victims; they (1459,11)machinations.
A thousand times would(575,8)shed my own blood, drop by drop,(679,8)
saved their lives; but(968,12),(483,10),(1839,8)(999,11)
sacrifice the whole human race.”

The conclu(527,8)this speech convinced(587,11)that my ideas were
deranged, and he instantly chang(1873,8)ubject of our convers(1375,9)
endeavoured to alter the course(436,8)houghts. He wished as much as
possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in
Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my
misfortunes.

As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in(1408,8)t, but I no longer talked in(2038,9) incoherent manner of my own
crimes; sufficient for me was the conscious(811,8)them. By the utmost
self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which
sometimes desired to declare(1770,8)to(699,11)world, and my manners
were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey
to the sea of ice.

A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the
following letter from Elizabeth:
(1397,9) Friend,

“It gave me the greatest pleasure to(102,8) a(89,13)my uncle
dated at Paris; you are(574,11)at a formidable distance, and I may
hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you
must have(825,9)! I expect(95,12)looking even more ill than
when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been(879,8)most miserably,
tortured as(2004,8)been by anxious suspense; yet I (258,12)peace in
your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of
comfort and tranquillity.

“Yet I fear that(991,10)feelings now exist that made you so(240,9)e
a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I w(1629,8) disturb you at
this period, when so many (1260,11) weigh upon you, but a
(1516,13)that I had with(685,9) previous to his departure renders
some explanation necessary(929,11)meet.

E(39,10)! You may possibly say, What can(905,10) have to explain? If
you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.
But(901,9)distant from me, and it is(168,8)e(583,9) may dread and yet
be pleased with this(285,12); and in a probability(2020,9)being the
case, I dare not any(1629,8)postpone writing what, during your absence, I
have often(1947,8)to express to you but have never had(2021,9)age to begin.

“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of
your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this (1130,8)ng, and
taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
place(108,10)affectionate playfellows(349,8)childhood, and, I
believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But
as brother and sister often entertain a lively(167,10) towards each
other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our
case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual
happiness, with simple truth—Do you not lov(286,9)?

“You have travelled; y(20,8)spent several years of your life at
Ingolstadt; and I conf(750,10), my friend, that when I saw you last
autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every
creature, I c(1472,9)help supposing(1098,11)ight regret our
connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes(874,16), although they opposed themselve(1040,8)r inclinations.
But this is false reasoning.(351,35)I love
you a(1926,8)in my airy dreams of futurity(496,10)been my constant
friend and companion. But it is your (635,9) I desire as well as my
own(501,8)declare(1290,8)(1224,9)marriage would render me eternally
(1999,9) unless it were the dictate(670,9)own free choice. Even now
I weep to think that, borne down as(1695,9)by the cruellest
(2024,11),(1684,9)stifle,(46,8)word _honour_, all hope of that
love and(312,11)which would alone restore you(550,8)self. I, who
have so disinterested an(1196,11)for you, may increase your miseries
tenfold by being an obstacl(420,8)r wishes. Ah!(1665,9)be assured
(1952,8)r cousin and playmate has too sincere a love(157,8) not to be
made (484,10)by this(958,8)tion. Be happy(1108,11); and if you
obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth
will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.

“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the
next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle
will send me new(1454,10)health,(301,8)I see but one smile on your
lips when we meet, occasioned(408,9)or any other exertion of mine, I
shall need no othe(1066,11).

“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”



T(347,11)revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of
the fiend—“_I will be with you(268,9)wedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the
dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear m(1765,11)glimpse of(2014,10) which promised partly to console my sufferings. O(151,13)he
had determined(58,8)ummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a

victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he
were vanquished,(80,14) free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the
peasant enjoys when his family(1831,12)assacre(620,9)his eyes, his
cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,
penniless, and alone, but free. Su(1594,9)be my liberty except(2047,11)

remorse and guilt(1725,13)pursue me until death.

Sweet and beloved (1022,9)! I read and reread her letter, and some
softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal
dreams of (1930,9)joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the
angel’s arm b(107,8)drive(959,9)(2037,8). Yet I would die to make
(1295,8)y. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,
again, I considered whether my marriag(930,8)hasten my fate. My
destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer
should suspect that I postponed it, influe(606,8)his menaces, he would
surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed
_to(1496,9)me on my (1493,13)_, yet he did not(327,9) that
threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that
he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately
after the enuncia(1914,8)(560,10)s. I resolved, therefore, that if my
(84,9) union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
father’s(2008,10), my adversary’s designs against my life(556,8)not retard it a single hour.

In this state of mind I wrote to(1093,10). My letter was calm and
affectionate. “I fear, my(1161,9)girl,” I said, “little(211,10)
remains for us on earth; yet all(745,8)may one day enjoy is centred in
you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate(313,9)and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret,(1390,10), a
(829,9)one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with
horror(1298,9)n, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only
won(872,8) I survive what(196,8)endured. I will confide this tale of
misery and terror(330,8)the day after our(1293,10)shall take place,
for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect(135,8)nce between us. But
until the(1427,8)jure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most
earnestly entreat, and I know(327,10)comply.”

In about a week (1062,10)arrival of(1909,10)’s(814,9)e returned
to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm (861,9), yet tears were
in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a
change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly
vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of
compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I
was.

The tranquillity which I now enjoyed(1694,9)endure. Memory brought madness
with it, and when I thought of w(254,8)passed, a real insanity possessed
me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage,(45,11)low and
despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,
bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.

(1568,9) alone had the power to draw me from these fits;(519,11) voice
would soothe me when transported by (536,8)and inspire(817,9)human
feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with (794,8)or me. When reason
(946,8), she would remonstrate and(1570,10) to(142,16)
resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but(40,8)
guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxur(60,10)
otherwise(635,11)found in indulging the excess of grief.

Soon after my(1271,9)my fa(633,11)of my immediate(1555,10)with(562,10). I remained silent.

“Have you, then, some other attachment?”

“None on earth. I love(1929,10) and look forward to our union with
delight. Let(1741,9)therefore be fixed; and on it(1832,11)secrate
myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”

“My dear Victor(1730,9)speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen
us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love
for those whom we have lost to(27,10) yet live. Our circle will be
small but bound close(1110,8)ties of(1750,10) and mutual(225,11).
A(1371,8)time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of
car(155,9) born to replace those of(240,14)been so cruelly
deprived.”

Such were the lesson(468,8)father. But to me the remembrance of the
threat (1121,8); nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had
yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as
invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with
you on your wedding-night_,”(131,10)regard the threatened fate as
unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of(1000,11)were
balanced (1952,13)I(973,10), with a contented and even cheerful
countenance, agre(81,8)(1252,10)that i(968,11) would consent, the
ceremony(390,8)take place in ten days(381,8)us put, as I imagined,
the seal to my fate.

Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish
intention(703,8)iendish adversary, I(1784,8)ather have banished myself
for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over
the earth than have(337,8)ed to this miserabl(1619,10). But, as if
possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real(278,10)s; a(1156,8)I(335,9)tha(354,8)prepared only my own(1526,8)I
hastened that of a far dearer victim.

As the period fixed for our(1845,10)drew nearer, wheth(366,8)cowardice or
a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my
feelings by an appea(1216,9)hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the(843,12)(1315,13), but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer
eye(1009,13). She looked(2012,26) placid(1007,8)ment,
not unmingl(1067,8)a little fear, which past(1907,15)d impressed,
that what now appeared certain and tangibl(2046,12)might soon dissipate
into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep(1204,8)rlasting regret.

Preparations were made for(349,8)nt, congratulatory visits were received,
and all wore a smiling(524,11). I shut up, as well as I could, in my own
heart the anxie(572,8)preyed there and enter(1471,8)seeming earnestness
into the pla(1910,15), although they might only serve as the
deco(290,8)of my tragedy. Throug(1512,11)’s exertions a part of
the inherit(2005,8)(1673,10)had been restored to her by the Austrian
government. A small possession on the shores of Como belong(85,9). It
was(1703,8)that, immediately after(790,10), we(1939,8)proceed to Villa
Lavenza and spend our first days of(713,11)beside the beautiful lake
near which it stood.

In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the
fiend(1876,8)openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger
constantly about me and was ever(376,8)watch to prevent artifice, and
by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed,(653,8)period approached, the threat(1107,10)more as a delusion, not to be
regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while th(1166,12)I hoped for
in my(1652,10)wore(210,11)(1541,14)certainty as the day fixed
for its solemnisation(1730,12) and I heard it continually spoken of
as an occurrence which no accident could possibly(426,8).

(910,10)seemed happy; my(399,9) demeanour contributed greatly to
calm her mind. But(916,8)day that was to fulfil my wishes and my
destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;
and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had
promised to reveal(1170,8)on the following day. M(1957,8) was in the
(950,9)overjoyed, and, in the bustle of p(1667,10), only recognised in
the(264,11) of his niece the diffidence of a bride.

After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my
(1489,8), but it (1334,15)(1474,11)and I(1317,8)commence our
journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and(733,8)ing our
voyage(378,23)The day was fair, the wind favourable;
all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.

Those were the last moment(1850,8)life during(563,9)enjoyed the
feeling(1528,13). We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we
were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we(141,13)beauty(754,8)scene, sometimes on one side(790,8)lake, where we saw
Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,
surmounting all,(1793,15)Mont Blanc, and the(652,8)age of snowy
mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her;(234,11)coasting the
opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the
ambition that would quit its native countr(1209,8)n almost
in(273,8)able barrier to the invader who(1970,8)wish to enslave it.

I took the hand of(912,10). “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If
you knew what I have suffered and(25,8)may yet endure, you would
(380,13)let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this
one day at least permits me to enjoy.”

“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied(1173,10); “there is, I hope,
nothing(2030,8)ress you; and be assur(1248,8)if a lively joy is not
painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me
not to depend too much(1838,8)prospect that is opened before us, but I
will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move
along and how the clouds, which(1071,12)bscure and(1093,11)rise
above the dome(1043,8)(981,8)render this scene of beauty still more
interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming(1835,8)clear waters(1228,11)can distinguish every pebble that lies at
the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature
appears!”

Thus(1831,11)(1195,9)ed to divert her thoughts and mine from all
reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;
joy for a few instants shone in her eye(2028,10)continually gave place
(824,8)action and reverie.

The sun sank lower in the heavens; w(1801,9)the river Drance and
observed its path through the chasms(1743,8)higher(1586,9)glen(28,8)
lower hills. The Alps here come clos(1395,10)lake, and we approached
the amphitheatre of (1669,10)which forms its eastern boundary. The
spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it(1801,9)range
(121,11) above(15,10)by which it was overhung.

The wind(971,8)had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,
sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water
and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as(393,14) the
shore, from(241,12)fted the most delightful scent of flowers and
hay. (679,13)beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I tou(535,9)shore I felt those cares and fears revive(1350,9)on were to clasp
me and cling to me for ever.




Chapter 23


It was eight o’clock when(171,10); we walked for a short time on(326,12)enjoyi(373,9)ansitory light,(852,8)n retired(809,8)inn and
contempla(381,8)lovely(1501,10)(1405,9)oods, and(825,10),(1609,8)d
in darkness, yet still displa(160,8)ir black outlines(730,23)fallen(1138,8)south, now rose with great violence
in the west. The moon had reached her summit(1226,15) and was
beginning to descend;(1863,11) swept across it swifter than the
flight(1238,8)vult(1893,8)dimmed her rays, while(1203,9) reflect(801,8)(1882,8)the busy(1398,8)(1921,8)ed still busier by the restless waves
that were (219,13)rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain(256,8)ed.

I had been calm dur(625,8)day, but so soon as night(538,9) the
shapes of objects, a thous(869,10)arose in my mind. I was anxious
and watchful(320,8)my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in
my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my
life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that
of my adversary was extinguished.

Elizabeth (1876,9)my agitation for some time in timid(1215,9)ful silence,
but there was something in my glanc(1256,8)communicated terror to her, and
trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?
(46,11)you fear?”

“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this n(1259,9)
all will be safe; but (38,10) is dreadful, very(15,9).”

I passed an hour in this state of mind, when s(834,8)I(959,11)how
(374,8)the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,
and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her
until I had obtained some knowledge as(1554,8)situation of my enemy.

She left me, and I continu(78,8)time walking up and down the passages
of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to
(815,12). But I discovered no trace of him(1502,8)(1283,13)
conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the
execu(304,8)his menaces(541,17)heard a shrill and(643,9)
scream. It came(1083,10)room into which (1029,10)had(1997,8). As I
heard it, the whole truth rushed into(1367,8), my arms dropped, the
mo(507,8)every muscle and fib(1072,8)uspended; I could feel the blood
trickl(1106,10)veins and ting(25,8)the extremities of my limbs. This
state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated(674,8)rushed
into(335,9).

Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the
destruc(808,8)the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was
there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down
and her pale and distorted features half (803,8)by her hair. Everywhere I
turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung
by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!
Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment
onl(493,8)lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.

When I re(1124,8)I found myself surrounded by the people(545,8)inn; their
countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others
appeared only as a mockery, a shadow(669,8)feelings that op(114,8)me. I
escaped(1143,9)m(1549,8)room where lay the body of(1162,10)(1940,10) my
wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been mov(130,11)
posture in(1845,9)had first beheld her, and now, as she lay(802,11)upon
her arm and a handkerchief(866,15)her face and neck, I might have
supposed her asleep.(1126,9) towards her and embraced her with ardour, but
the deadly languor and coldness(1110,8)limbs told me that what I now held
in(1484,9)had ceased to be the(1588,11)whom I had loved and cherished.
T(944,9)ous mark(576,9)iend’s grasp was on her neck,(1266,8)
breath(135,15)issue from her lips.

While I still hung over her(1564,8)agony of despair, I happ(1927,8)look up.
The window(312,9)room had before been darken(1567,10)felt a kind of
panic on seeing the pale yellow light(1519,8)moon illuminate the chamber.
The shutters(739,10)thrown ba(307,8)with a sensa(1912,8)horror not to be
described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.
A grin(448,8)the fac(1185,9)monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his
fiendish finger he point(772,11)the corpse of my wife(812,18)
t(442,9), and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,
le(1218,10)his station, and running with the swift(871,8)lightning,
plunged into the lake.

The repor(511,9)pistol brought a crow(57,11)room. I(281,11)
the spo(1709,8)he had dis(1481,8), and we followed the track with
boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we
returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a
form conjured up by my fancy(131,8)having landed, they proceeded to
search the country, parties going in different directions among the
woods and vines.

I attempted to accompany them and(133,11)a short distance(1663,10)house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken
man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my
eyes, and my skin was parched(726,10)heat of fever. In t(779,8)e I
was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had
(1406,8); my eyes wander(279,8)(1403,10)as if to seek something that
(1667,8)st.

After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawl(934,12)room
where(1145,18)beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I
(1674,10)it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no
distinct idea presented itself to my mind(607,9)thoughts rambled to
various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes(1932,8)ir
cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death
of William, the execu(1708,8)Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly
(1542,10); even at that moment I knew no(23,8)y only remaining
friends were saf(942,10) malignity(2046,8)fiend; my father even now
might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest (46,9)dead at his
feet. This idea made me shud(329,8)recalled me to action. I started
up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.

(712,11)no horses to be procu(1613,9)I must(91,8)by(1749,9); but the
wind was unfavourable,(583,8) rain fell in torrents. However, it was
hardly morning(125,9)ight reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men
to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from
mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,
(269,8)excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any
exer(522,8)threw down the oar, and leaning(1656,9)upon my hands, gave way
to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were
familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated(584,8) day
before in the (1914,8)of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.
Tears streamed from(1652,8). T(664,8)had ceased for a moment(764,8)saw
the fish play(154,8)waters as they had done a few hours before;(34,9)
then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as
a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,
but nothing could appe(462,9)as it(225,10)the day before. A fiend had
snatch(365,9)e every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been
so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is singl(568,9)history of
man.

But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last
overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reache(1877,8)_acme_, and what(1379,8)now relate can but be tedious to you. Know
that, one by one, my (1759,14)(395,8)away; I was left desolate. My
own strength is exhaust(1533,15)tell, in a few words, what remains of
my hideous narration.

I arrived at Geneva. M(1880,9)(1836,11)yet lived,(1043,9)former sunk
under the tidings(1337,8)bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old
man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for(986,10)lost their charm(1755,8)ir
delight—his(969,10), his more than daughter, whom he doted on with
all that affection which a man feels, who(1304,8)decline of life, having
few(68,10)s, clings more earnestly to those t(450,10). Cursed, cursed
be the fiend that brought(1758,8)on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste
in wretchedness! He could not live (476,10)horrors that were accumulated
around him; the springs of existence suddenly(1770,9); he was unable to
rise from his b(753,8)(740,9)days he died in my arms.

What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and
darkness were the only objec(1157,8)presse(1983,8)e. Sometimes,
indeed, I dreamt(779,8)(716,12)flowery meadows and pleasant vales
with the(1084,9)of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a
dungeon. Melancholy(1340,9), but by degrees I gained a clear
conception of my miseries and situation and was then releas(2001,10)
prison. F(946,12)called me mad, and during many months, as I
understood, a solitary cell had been my habit(1238,8)Liberty, however,(43,10)a useless gift to me, had I not, as I
awakened to reason, at the same time (37,14)venge. As the
memory of past misfortunes(570,16), I began to reflect on their
cause—the monster whom I had created, the(1937,11)dæmon(40,11)
sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a
maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed
that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal
revenge(1249,8)cursed head.

Nor did my hate long confine itself to(514,9)wishes;(385,11)
(385,14) best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about
a month after my(793,8), I repaired to a criminal judge(1603,8)town
and told him(1870,8)had an accusation to make,(1904,8)knew the
destroyer of my family, a(1587,8)I requir(1554,10)exert his whole
authority(1906,8) apprehension of the murderer.

The magistrate list(839,8)me with atten(1082,9)kindness. “Be
assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall
be spared to discover the villain.”

“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the
deposition(394,10)ve(381,8). It is indeed a tale so strange that I
should fear you w(1896,9)credit it(1652,9)re not something in truth
which(1244,9) wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to
be mistaken for a dream, and(228,8)no motive for falsehood.” My
manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had form(1986,8)
own heart a resolu(736,8)pursue(1192,9)oyer to death(720,8)(900,10)
quieted my agony(938,9)an interval reconciled me to life. I now related
my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with
accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclam(1744,8)(855,15)appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued
he became more(910,8)ve and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with
horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted
(1485,8)ountenance.

When(1769,8)oncluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I
accuse(1452,9)whose seizure and punishment I call upon you(1297,10)your
whole power(1007,8)your duty as a(1273,11)(832,8)believe and hope that
your feelings(59,8)n will not revolt from the execut(1393,9)ose
func(1284,9)this occasion.”

Thi(905,9) caused a considerable chan(1647,10)physiognomy of my own
auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given
to(1301,8)of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon
to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his(792,9)ity
returned. He(1352,9), answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you
every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to
have powers which would put all my(1780,11)to defiance. Who can follow an
animal which can traverse the sea of ic(1007,8)habit caves and dens where
no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since
the commission(400,8)crimes, and no one can conjec(108,8)what place he
has wandered or what region he may now(214,8).”

“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I(278,8), and if
he ha(2012,9)taken refu(831,10)Alps,(131,8)be hunted like the chamois
and(1730,9)d as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not
credit(1295,11)ve and(239,8)intend(1852,14)enem(950,9)e
(1273,11)which is his desert.”

As I spoke, rage sparkl(1969,8) eyes; t(1692,14)was intimidated.
“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself(377,9)it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured(481,9)shall suffer(234,12)proportionate to(651,11)(381,8)fear, from what you have
yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove
impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should
make up your mind to disappointment.”

“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My
revenge is of no moment to you; yet(194,8)I allow it to be a vice, I
confess that it(1961,8)devouring and only pa(1061,9)my soul. My rage
is unspeakable when I reflect(373,8)e murderer, whom I have turned
loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have
but one resourc(2029,9)devote(709,9)either in my life or death, to
his destruction.”

I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy
in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of(1984,8)ughty fierceness
which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan
(1048,10), whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of
devotion and heroism, this elevat(561,8)ind had much the appearance of
madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and
reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.

“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
wisdom! Cease; you know not w(835,10)you say.”

I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on
some other mode of action.




Chapter 24


My present situation was one in which all voluntary(1737,8) was
swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; (1164,8)alone
endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and
(130,8)me to be calculat(1171,8)calm at periods when otherwise
(490,8)(985,9) would have been my portion.

My first resolu(306,9)to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I
was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became
hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together(30,8)few jewel(1069,8)had belong(803,9)moth(1157,8)departed.

And now my wanderings bega(569,9)re to cease but with life.(1415,8)traversed a vast(362,8) of the earth and have endured all the hardship(1259,9)ravellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I
have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon
the sandy plain and prayed f(1611,8). But(794,9)kept me alive; I dared
not die and leave(529,10)ary in being.

When I quitted(658,8)m(697,8)labour(693,8)gain some clue by which I
might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,
and I wandered many hours round the confines(502,8)town, uncertain
what path I should pursue. As night approached I foun(777,9)at the
ent(1606,8) the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father
reposed. I entered it and(124,12)the tomb which marked their
graves. Everything was silent except the leav(270,11)rees, which
were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the
scene(1256,17)solemn and affecting even to an uninterested
observer. The spirit(448,9)(1062,8) seemed to flit around and to
cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen,(58,8)the head of the
mourner.

The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to
rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also liv(762,8)to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass
and kissed(1303,15)with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the
sacred earth o(2010,8)I kneel,(577,8)shades that wander near me(35,8)
deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; an(668,8)e, O Night(646,11)pirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,
until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will
preserve my life; to execute this dear(1451,9)will I again behold the sun
and tread the green herbage of earth(757,8)otherwise(1246,8)vanish from my
eyes for ever. And I call on you,(897,18)(681,8)(33,8)(1955,9)
ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed
and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the(859,8) that now
torments me.”

I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me
that(733,12)of my(945,8)d friends heard(1485,10)ved my devotion, but
the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.

I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and(1913,9)
laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed
it(1229,8)felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.
Surely in that moment(1962,10)(1633,10)(309,10)by frenzy and have
destroyed my miserable(1305,10) but that my vow wa(438,12)that I
was reserved for(737,10). The(182,9) died away, when a well-known
and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addr(526,9)in an
audible whisper, “I am satisfied,(228,11)wretch! You(268,8)termined to live(1654,8)(67,12).”

I darted towards the spot from(1799,9)e sound proceeded, but the devil
eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk(2018,8)moon arose and shone
full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled(601,8)re than
mortal speed.

I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a
slight clue, I followed the winding(1339,9)Rhone, but vainly. The
blue Mediterranean appear(1009,8)by a strange chance, I saw the fiend
enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I
took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.

Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although (1182,8) evaded me, I
have ever(341,10)in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by
this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; s(83,9)h(314,9),
who feared that if I lost all trace of him(1179,10)(1672,8)and die,
left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my h(1902,9)I saw
the print(184,8)huge step on the white plain. To you first entering
on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand
what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the
least pains which I was dest(1187,8)endure; I was cursed by som(1122,8)and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good
(955,9)and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly
extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties(719,11),
when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast
was prepared for m(974,9)desert that restored and inspirited(664,8)
fare was, indeed, coarse, such a(894,14)(1477,8)country ate, but
I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits t(611,8)d
invoked to aid me. Often(1893,8)ll was dry, the heavens cloudless, and
I was parched by thirst, a (1483,9)ou(470,8)bedim the sky, shed the
few drops(324,8)vived me, and vanish.

(1553,10),(573,8)could,(293,8)rse(1567,9)rivers;(1855,10)æmon
generally avoided these, as(319,8)here that the population of the
(397,8)chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom
seen(1161,8)(147,10)subsisted(1150,9)ild animals that crossed my
path. I had money(936,9)and gained the friendship(1851,8)villagers
by distributing it; or I brough(1020,10)some food(582,11) killed,
which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had
provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.

My lif(445,9)passed thus, was indeed hateful to(595,9)it was during
sleep alone(804,8)could taste joy. O blessed sleep!(815,13)most
miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The
(944,13)guarded me had (293,9)these moments, or rather hours, of
happines(1018,9)might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of
this respite,(1945,10)have su(1344,9)my hardships. During the day I was
sustain(1316,18)by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my
friends, my wif(354,10)beloved(1331,8); again I saw the benevolent
countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s
voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth(1386,14)wearied by
a toilsome march, I persuaded myself(1476,8)was dreaming until night should
come an(942,9)should then enjoy reality(1733,8)arm(224,8)dearest(356,8). What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to
their dear forms, as s(1953,8) they haunted even my waking(717,8)and
(267,8)(266,13)they still lived! At such(794,8) vengeance, that
burned within me, died in my heart(1433,8)pursued my path towards the
destruc(1560,11) dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the
mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than(73,8)ardent desir(713,8)soul.

What his feel(1670,10)whom(225,11)I cannot know. S(410,8), indeed, he
left marks in writing(1705,8)bark(1914,9)trees or cut in st(1369,9)guided
me(1020,8)tigated my fury. “My reign is not yet
over”—these words were legible in one of these
inscriptions—“you liv(1413,10)power is complete. Follow me; I
seek the everlasting ice(225,9)north, where you will feel the misery of
cold and frost, to(466,9)am impassive. Y(69,9)ind near this place, if
you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my
enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and (1768,9)
hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”

Scoffing devil! Again do I vow(946,10)(1469,8)do I devote thee,(1900,10) fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search
until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my
(1546,9)(2016,9)eparted (1696,9)who even now prepare for me the
reward of my tedious toil and horrible(1943,11)!

As I still(1188,12)journey to(677,10)ward, the snows thicke(1916,8)the
cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were
shut up in their hovels, and only a few(1328,8)most hardy ventured forth to
seize the animals whom starvation had forced from(115,8)iding-places to
seek for prey. The rivers were covered with (1995,9)no fish could be
procured(542,8)us I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.

The triumph of my enemy(385,11)with the difficulty of my labours. On(1251,13) that he left was in (1324,11): “Prepare! Your toils
only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter
upon a(642,9)(1305,9)r sufferings will satisfy my(1374,12)
hatred.”

My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these s(1106,8)words; I
resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven(741,11)
me, I continu(550,8)unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,
(1294,8)e ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary
of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was(1018,8)blue season(1940,8)
south! C(751,17)it was only to be distinguish(860,8)land by
its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when
they beheld the Mediterranean(970,9) hills of Asia, and hailed with
rapture the(293,9) of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down
and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in
safet(1398,9)place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,
to meet and grapple with him.

Some weeks before this(1890,8)I had (1190,8) a sledge and dogs(1207,9)
(682,8)d(1558,11)with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the
fiend posses(75,9)ame advantages(367,8)found that, a(188,9)I had
daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that
when I first saw(878,11)he was but one day’s(1833,9)in advance, and
I hoped to intercept him(369,8)he should reach the beach. With new
courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arriv(1040,8)wretched
hamlet on the seashore. I inquired(1863,8)inhabitants concerning(423,11)and(322,8)accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,
had(165,9)the night before, arm(1855,8)a gun and many pistols,
putting to flight(184,17)of a solitary cottage through fear of
his terrific appearance. He had carried of(1033,8)store of winter
food, and placing it in(816,9), to draw which he had seized on a
numerous drove of trained dogs,(51,8)harn(796,9)m, an(806,10)
night,(1455,8)jo(1211,8) horror-struck villagers, had pursued his
(1898,8)across(548,8) in a direction that led to no land;(138,8)y
conjectured that he must speedily be destroy(1900,9) breaking(1625,8)ice or frozen(37,8)eternal frosts.

On hearing this(640,12) I suffered a temporary access of despair.
He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endles(318,21)mountainous ice(1848,8) ocean, amidst cold that few(1941,8)(897,14)uld long endure and which I, the native of a
genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea
that the fiend(1187,8)l(252,8)be triumphant, my rage and vengeance
returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.
After a slight repose, during which the spirit(353,9)dead hovered
round and instigated me to toil and reveng(1367,8)pared for my(1497,8).

I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of
the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I
departed from land.

I cannot guess how many days have passed since then(1871,8)have endured
misery which nothing but(900,13)sentiment of a just retribution
burning within my heart could(112,8)abl(394,9)support. Immense and
rugged(839,9)s of ice often barred up my passag(956,9)often heard
the thunder(1759,8)ground sea,(581,9)reatened my(1003,10)on. But
again the frost came and made the path(993,9)sea secure.

By the quantity(463,13)(966,8) had consumed, I(881,8)guess that
I had(452,8)three weeks in this(681,8)(1421,9) continual protraction
of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of
despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indee(1330,9)secured
her prey(1393,8)should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after
the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the
summit of a sloping ic(1476,10), and one, sinking under his fatigue,
died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
caught a dark spe(417,12)dusky plain. I strained my sight to
discover what i(890,8)be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I
distinguished a sledge(606,9)distorted proportions of a well-known
form within. Oh! With what a (1062,8)gush did hope revisit(1077,9)!
Warm tears filled(614,8)(958,8)I hastily wiped away, (1732,8)y might
not intercept the view I had(1594,9)æmon; but still(341,10)was
dimmed by the(191,9)drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
oppressed me, I wept aloud.

But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dog(1790,8)ir
dead companion, gave them(1630,13)portion of food, and after an
hour’s rest(1317,8)was absolutely necessary, and yet(40,11)bitterly
irksome to me, I(1175,8)ed my route. The(608,8)was still visible, nor
did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short
time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed
perceptibly(1088,8)on it, and when, after nearly two days’(1442,8), I
beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant,(1858,10)bounded within
me.

But now, when I appear(1393,10)within grasp of my foe, my hopes were
(1156,9)ex(1016,10)(1873,8)lost all trace of him more utterly than I had
ever don(1270,8). A(1908,11) was heard; (1949,15)its progress, as
the waters rolled and swelled(1564,9)me, became every moment more ominous
and terrific. I (903,8)on, but in vain. The wind arose;(2002,9)roared;
and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a
tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few
minutes a tumultuous sea(310,8)between me an(632,10)(1915,8)was left
drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was(971,8)ally lessening and
thus preparing for me a hideous death.

In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs di(675,9)
myself was about to sink under the accumula(1271,8)distress(825,8)saw your
vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.
I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded
at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my(1966,8)to construct oars, and
by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in
the direc(1611,8)your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,
still to trust myself(1862,8)mercy(1959,8)seas rather than abandon my
purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue
(1440,8). But your(237,11)was northwards. You took me on board when my
vigour was exhaust(1373,10)should soon have su(695,9)my multiplied
hardships into a dea(188,11)still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.

Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me(391,8)dæmon, allow
me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,
swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him
and satisfy my vengeance in hi(1139,8) And do I dare to ask of you to
undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the (393,10)that I have undergone?
No; I am not so selfish. Yet(1961,10)m dead, if he(520,8)appear, if
the ministers of(214,11)should(421,8) him to you, swear(321,8)
(321,10)live—(29,13)(350,11)triumph over my(1324,10)ed
woes and survive to add(923,8)list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent
and persuasive, and once his words had even power(141,9)heart; but
trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery
and fiend-like malice. Hear(91,8); call on the names of William,
Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and(1206,8)wretched Victor, and
thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the
steel aright.

August 26th, 17—.


You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not
feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles
mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not(235,8)e his
tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with
difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes
were now lighted up(1886,8)dignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow
and quenched in(1946,10)(590,8)ness.(304,10) he commanded his
countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a
tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression
(845,8)ildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.

His tale is connected and told(484,8) appearance(967,8)simplest truth,
yet I own to you that the let(1465,8)Felix and Safie, which he showed me,
and the apparition(1083,8)monster seen from our ship, brought to me a
greater convic(70,12)truth(1450,8)narrative than his asseverations,
however earnest and(298,10). Such a(155,9)has, then, really existence!
I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration(732,12)I
endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his
creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.

“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your
senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the
world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries(1450,8)not seek
to increase your own.”

(326,13)discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked
to see them(193,8)n himself corr(881,10)augmented them in many places,
but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held
with his enemy. “Since y(1794,8)preserved my(802,8)on,” said
he, “I w(1652,9)that a mutilated one should go down to
posterity.”

Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened(211,8)strangest
tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my
soul have been drunk up by the interest for my gues(1975,8)this tale
and his own eleva(1351,8)gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe
him, yet can I counsel one so(1782,9)ly miserable, so destitute of
every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can
now know will be when he composes his shattere(631,12)peace and
death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitud(64,8)lirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds(752,8)e (739,8)
friends and derives from that communion(296,12) for his(1081,10)or
excitements to his vengeance,(1773,9)y are not the cre(1915,8)f his
fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him(168,8)e reg(71,8)a
remote world. This faith gives a solemnity(169,8)reveri(316,8)render
them(1838,8)lmost as imposing and(762,9)ing as truth.

Our(1112,15)(244,8)always confined(296,8)own(1306,8) and
misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays
unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His
eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him,(768,9)relates
a pathetic incident or (1946,9)s to move the pass(521,8)pity or love,
without tears. What a glorious (1965,8) must he(1193,11)in the days
of his prosperity(177,10)is thus no(233,8)godlike in ruin! He seems
to feel(1226,9)worth(1913,8) greatnes(719,8) fall.

“When younger,” said he, “I(951,8)d myself destined for
some great enterprise. M(1442,9)s are profound, but I possessed a coolness
of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of
the worth of my nature supported me when others would(1602,11)oppressed,
for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that
might be useful to my fellow(551,9)s. When I reflected on the work I had
completed, no less a one than(1210,13) of a sensitive and rational
animal, I could not rank(492,8)with the herd of common projectors. But
this(1959,8), which(365,14)in the commencement of my career, now
serves only to plunge me lower(815,9)ust. All my specul(1222,8)nd hopes
are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am
chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of
analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I
conceived the idea and executed(506,19)man. Even now I cannot
recollect (1215,8)passion my(1646,10)while(636,10)was in(636,8). I trod
heaven in my(518,8)s, now exulting in(274,10), now burning(612,10)idea
of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once
was, you w(806,10)ecognise(734,9)is state of degradation. Despondency
rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,
never, never again to rise.”

Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have
sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert
seas(114,8)found such a one(1563,8)fear(150,8)gained him(1044,9)know his
value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses(835,9).

“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so
miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh
affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any
man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even
where the (147,10) are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,
the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our
minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our
infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,
are never eradicated; and they can judge(232,8)actions with more
(223,8)conclusions as to the integrity(297,8)motives. A sister or a
brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,

(313,8)(529,9)he(320,9)ttached, may, in spite of himself, be
contemplat(1480,8)suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only
through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever
I am, the soothing voice of my(800,10)(494,8) convers(1893,8)
(868,9)ill be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one
feeling in(1301,8)solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I
were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive
utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But
such is not my(1753,8); I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I
gave existence; then my lot on earth(376,9)fulfilled and I may die.”

My beloved Sister,

September 2d.


I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever
doomed to see again dear England(580,9)dear(1216,9)s that inhabit
it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows(381,8)have(633,9)d to be my(1494,12)look(1795,9)me for aid(1997,8)have
none to bestow. There is something terribly appal(776,8)our
situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is
terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered(1127,9)me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.

And what, Margaret,(1062,9)the state of your mind? You will not hear of my
destruction, and y(41,8)anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and
(57,9)have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My
(849,8)sister, the sickening failing(221,9)heart-felt expectations is,
in prospect, more(529,8)e to me than my own death. But you have a husband
and lovely children; you(2013,8)happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!

My unfortunate guest reg(747,8)with the tenderest compassion. He
endeavours to fill(56,9)hope and talks as if life were a possession
which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have
happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and(1984,9)
of myself, he fill(264,10)cheerful auguries. Ev(147,9)ilors feel
the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer(668,8); he
rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these
vast(1369,18)are mole-hills which will vanish before the
resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of
(780,11) delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny
caused by this(966,8).(1764,12)5th.


A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is
highly probable(1363,9)se papers may never reach you, yet I cannot
forbear recording it.

We are still(1794,31), still in imminent danger
of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of
m(1029,14)comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of
desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire
still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted(785,8)en suddenly
roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent
lifelessness.

I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of(698,9).
This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his
eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was ro(824,8)half
a dozen of(1209,12), who demanded admission into the cabin. They
enter(379,8)their leader addressed me. He told me that he(181,8)
companions had been chosen by the other(1369,9)to come in deputation
to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.
We were immured in ice and should(1028,8)(1006,8)escape, but they
feared that if, as was possible, the ice(80,8)dissipate and a free
passage be opened, I(129,8)be rash enough to continue my voyage and
lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted
this. They insisted, therefore, that(158,10)engage with a solemn
promise(277,8) the vessel(213,11)freed I would instantly direct my
course southwards.

This speech troubled me. I had not(1865,8)ed, nor had I yet conceived
the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I(583,14)or even in
possibility, refuse(1698,8)mand? I hesitated(1877,8)I answered, when
(1328,12), who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly
to have force(557,11)attend, now(1040,8)himself;(1374,9) sparkled,
(1114,8)cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,
he said,

“What do you mean? (18,12)demand of your captain? Are you, then,
so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious
expedition? “And w(725,8) was it(43,9)? Not because the way was
smooth and placid as a southern sea, bu(61,10)it was full of(911,8) and
terror,(104,9)at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth
and your courage exhibited(96,10)danger and death surrounded it, and
these you were to brave and overcome. For this(312,8)(357,10), for this
(28,8)n honourable undertaking. Y(103,8)hereafter to be hailed as the
benefactors(552,9)species, your names adored as belonging(193,10)men
who encountere(262,8)for honour(1748,8) benefit of mankind. And now,
behold, with the first imagination(489,10), or, if you will,(50,10)
mighty and terrific trial(782,10)ourage, you shrink away and are content
(311,8)nded down as men(1103,9)not strengt(1610,12)endure cold and
peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm
firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come
thus far and dragge(745,8)aptain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove
yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your
purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your
hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you(587,8)say that it
shall not. Do not return(178,8) families(690,10)stigma of disgrace
marked on your brows. Return as heroes wh(1639,9)ught and conquered and
who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”

He spoke this with a voice so modulat(620,9) different feelings expressed
in his speech, with an eye so(1422,9)lofty design and heroism, that can
you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were
unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire(347,8)sider of what had
been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously
desired the contrary, but(87,8)hoped that, with reflection, thei(1647,9)
woul(1039,8).

They retired and I(1976,8)towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and
almost deprived of life.

How (2025,9)will terminate, I(646,9), but I had rather die than
return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my
fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never
willingly continue(1440,11)their present hardships.

September 7th.


The die is cast; I(1358,8)nsented to(1057,8)if we are not destroyed.
Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back
ignorant and disappointed. I(1548,11)more philosophy than I possess
to bear this injustice with patience(262,13)12th.


It is past; I am returning to England.(285,8)lost(236,10)of utility
and glory(328,9)(43,8)friend. But I will endeavour to detail these
bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted
(824,8)England an(844,10)you,(133,8)not despond(543,13)9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard
at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were
in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief
attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in
such a degree tha(1172,9)entirely confined to his bed. The ice(248,8)
behind us and was driven with force(1284,9)the north; a breeze sprang from
the west, and(1837,8)11th the passag(78,14)south became perfectly
free. When the sailors saw this and(1758,9)ir(1055,8)to their native
country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,
loud and long-(1266,8)d. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the
cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they
will soon(240,11)(1049,8)”

“Do you, then, really return?”

“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.(34,10)(1953,9)
un(1524,10)to danger, and I must(1871,8)”

“Do so, if you will; b(1147,10)not. You may give up your(1739,8), but
mine is assigned to me by Heaven(126,8)dare not. I am weak, but
surely the spirits who assist my vengeance(1299,9)ow me with
sufficient strength.” Saying this, he(1351,10)ed to spring(573,9)
bed, but the exer(1023,9)too great for him; he fell back and fainted.

It was long before(1009,8)restored(396,8)often thought that life was
(1053,9)extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with
difficulty(1073,9)unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing
draught and ordered us to le(48,8)undisturbed. In the meantime he
told me tha(1761,11) had certainly not many hours to live.

His sentence was pronounc(327,10)(1488,11)grieve and be patient. I sat
by(1374,8), watching him;(327,9) were clos(421,10)(415,8)he slept; but
presently he call(756,9)in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,
said, “Alas! The(703,9) I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall
soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think
not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence(146,13)burning
hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed(1141,8)feel myself
justified in desiring the death of my adversary. Du(34,8)se last days I
have been(1994,10)in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.
In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature(1981,8)
bound(1969,9)him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
well-(459,10)s was my duty(1233,9)re was another still paramount to
that. My duties(2046,13)being(509,8)own species had greater claims to
my attention (1819,12) included a(55,9)proportion of(219,11)or
misery. Urged by this view, I refu(936,11)did right in refusing, to
create a companion for the first(413,9). He showed unparalleled malignity
and selfishness in evil; he destroyed(1254,10)s; he devoted to destruction
beings who possessed exquisite sensations,(498,10), and wisdom(679,10)
know where this thirst for(1849,11)may end. Miserable himself that he may
render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his(222,12) was
mine, but I have failed. When actuated by(340,8) and vicious motives, I
asked you to undertake my unfinished work(1883,8)renew this request now,
when I am only induced by reason and virtue.

“Yet I cannot ask(131,8)renounce your country and(504,8) to fulfil
this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have
little chance of meeting with him. But the considera(851,8)these
points, and the well balancing of w(149,8)may esteem your duties, I
leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturb(957,8)e near
approach of death. I dare (358,15)do what I think right, for I
(1741,13)misled by passion.

“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief(178,8)s me; in
other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the
only happy one which(789,8)enjoyed for several years. The forms of
the beloved dead flit before me(1289,8)hasten to their arms. Farewell,
Walton! Seek(1611,11)in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it
be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in
science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this?(1091,8)myself been
blasted in these hopes, yet(1771,9)may succeed.”

His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his
effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he
attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and
his eyes closed for ever, while the irradi(1038,9)a gentle smile passed
away from his lips.

Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinc(1145,10)is
glorious spirit? Wha(68,8)say that will enable(1509,13)stand the
depth of my sorrow? All that I(995,8)express would be inadequate and
feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
disappointment. But I journey towards(1473,10)and I may there find
consolation.

I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the
breeze blows fairly(1509,11)atch on deck scarcely stir. Again there
is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin
where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.
Good night, my sister.

Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the
remembr(1864,8)it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail
it; yet the tal(1493,15)recorded(652,12)complete without this
final and wonderful catastrophe.

I entered(365,10) where lay(369,16)my ill-fated and admirable
friend. Over him hung a form(1683,9)cannot find words to
describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth(1486,8)torted in its
proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long
locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and
(1709,8) texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my
approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung
(1079,8)the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as(304,9), of
such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and
endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.
I called on him to stay.

He paused, looking on me with wonder, an(1831,9)urning(1388,9)the
lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and
every feature and gestur(60,9)instigated by the wildest rage of some
uncontrollable passion.

“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my
crimes are consummated; the miserable serie(1021,8)being is wound to its
close! Oh,(1426,13)! Generous and self-devoted being!(1683,8)es it
avai(1909,9)now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably(532,9)d thee
b(18,9)ing all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he(1182,8)answer
me.”

His voic(492,9)suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to
me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in(202,12)his
enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and com(567,8) I(1126,9)ed this tremendous being; I dared not again raise(986,9)to his
face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I
attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster
continu(1327,12)wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I
gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest(1058,8)(925,11)Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you
had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse
before you had urged your diabolical vengeance(1377,9)extremity,
(977,12) would yet have lived.”

“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think(998,8)was then
dead to agony and(195,8)? He,” he (478,9), pointing(284,8)corpse,
“he suffe(695,8)in th(1247,11)ion(436,8)deed. Oh! Not the
ten-thousandth por(48,12)anguish that was mine during the
lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me
on, while my heart was poisoned(1808,8)morse. Think you that the
groans of Clerval were music to my ears? M(96,12)fashioned to be
susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice
and hatred, it did not endure the violenc(842,9)change without
torture such as you(1446,8)even imagine.

“After the(1762,8)(258,11)I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken
and overcome. I pitied(1749,13); my pity amounted to horror; I
abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of
my exist(998,9)of its unspeakable torments, dar(135,8)pe for
happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and(1268,8)s from the
indulg(477,8)which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for(1236,10). I
recollected my threat and resolv(400,8)it should be accomplished. I
knew(1207,12)preparing for myself a deadly torture, bu(1256,11)
slave, not the master, of an impulse(299,9)detested yet could not
disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had
cast off all(453,8), subdued all(1260,8), to ri(1352,10)excess of my
despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no
choice but to adapt my nature to an element(577,9)had willingly
chosen. The comple(1508,8)my demoniacal design(154,8)(567,13)
(1967,8) And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”

I was at first tou(1288,8)the expressions of his misery; yet,(1045,8)called
to mind what(1137,13) had said(69,8)powers of eloqu(1059,8)
persuasion(1437,11)I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my
friend, (884,12)was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.
“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation(48,9)
have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings(1681,11)they are
consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!
If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would
he become the prey, of your accursed(1217,13)t is not pity(296,10)feel; you(195,8)only becaus(1886,8)ctim(93,9)malignity is withdrawn
from your power.”

“Oh, i(120,9)thus—(9,8),” interrupted the being.
“Yet such must(259,8)im(776,8) conveyed to you by what appears to
be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow(1675,8) in my misery.
No sympathy may I ever find. When I first(1767,8)it, it(1454,8) love of
virtue, the(1781,10)of (1894,9) and affection with which my whole being
overflowed,(1612,9)ished to be participated. But now that virtue has
(574,8)o me a shadow, and that(152,25)are turned into
bitter and loathing despair, in wha(1810,9)I seek for(340,9)? I am
content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure;(1282,8)die, I am
well satisfi(1941,8)abhorr(1254,8) opprobrium(1964,8)load my memory. Once
my fancy was soothed with dreams of (471,8)of fame, and of enjoyment. Once
I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would
love me for(1872,9)llent qualities(2046,9)was capable of unfolding. I was
nouris(215,9)high thoughts of honour and devotion(594,10)crime has
degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no

frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe(836,8)am the same
creature whose(275,10)were once fil(1737,8) sublime and transcendent
vi(1978,9)the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the
fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man
had friends and associates in his(1872,11); I am alone.

“You, who call Frankenstein your (2042,8)seem to have a knowledge of my
crimes and his misfortune(257,8)n the detail which he gave you of them
he could not sum up the hours and months of misery(794,9)endured
wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did
not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still
I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no
injustice in this? Am I to b(716,9) the only criminal, when all
humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his
friend from his door with contumely(78,17)execrate the rustic
who(1884,8)to(391,8) the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous
and immaculate beings! I, the miserable(928,9)abandoned, am an

blood boils at the recollection of this (454,9).

admiration among men, t(1607,8)(238,9)pursued him even to that
irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but
your abhorrence(1644,8)equal that with(1953,9)regard myself. I look on the
hand(1996,8)executed the deed; I thin(46,8) heart in which the

crim(134,8)orn by the bitterest remorse, where can(358,8)rest but in
death?

“Farewell! I leave you,(436,8)you the last of humankind whom these
eyes will ever behold. (90,8), Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive
and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better
satiated in my life than in my destruction. But(1775,8)not so; thou
didst seek my extinction,(1679,8)might not cause greater wretchedness;
and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think
and feel, thou woul(43,8)desir(275,12) a vengeanc(150,10)than

thine, for(630,11) sting of(636,8) will(206,10) to rankle in my
wounds until death shall close them for ever.

“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I

miseri(737,8)be(529,8)(1920,10)ascend(1796,17)triumphantly and

will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it(470,10)surely think thus.
(1095,8).”

He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft
which lay(531,8)o the vessel. He was soon borne away(226,9)(1448,8)
lost in darkness and distance.
