_To Mrs. Saville, England._


St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.


You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
(55,6)undertaking.

I am already far north of London(155,6)as I walk(83,9)treets of
(388,13)I feel a cold(76,6)ern breeze play upon my cheeks,(329,6)
braces my nerves and fills me(341,6)delight. Do you(201,6)stand this
feeling? This(115,7)(95,7) has travelled from the regions towards
(469,6)(276,6)dvancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded(710,6)the pole is(493,6)eat of
frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
(290,6) of beauty(82,7)(394,7)There, Margaret,(623,7)n is for ever
visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon(182,6)iffusing a
perpetual splendour(124,7)—for(883,6)your leav(355,6)(810,6), I will put
some trust in preceding navigators—there snow(640,6)(324,6)re banished;
and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
wonder(743,6)in(349,8)every(662,7) hitherto discovered o(978,6)habitable
globe. Its production(830,7)eatures(146,9)ithout example,(483,8)phenomena(724,6)e heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in(763,7)un(155,10)
solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I
may (389,6)(245,8) the wondrous power(980,7)attract(759,6)needle and may
regulate a thousand celestial observa(299,6)that require onl(952,6)
voyage to rend(136,6)ir seeming eccentricities consistent(760,9). I
shall satiate my ardent curiosity(700,6)the sight of a part(396,8)world
never before visited,(237,8) tread(615,8)(43,13)imprinted by
the foot of man. These are my enticements(90,6)the(495,6)sufficient to
conquer all fear of danger or death(63,6)o induce me to commence(350,6)laborious (360,7)(264,9)joy a child feels when he embarks(581,6)little
boat,(325,6)his holiday mates, on an expedition of(845,9)y up his
native river. But supposing all these conjec(848,6)to be false, you
cannot contest the inestimable benefit(695,7)I (534,6)confer on all
mankind, to the last generation, by(787,9)ing a passage nea(805,6)pole
to(924,7)(870,6)ies,(708,6)ach(824,9) present so many months are
requisite; or by ascertaining(682,6)ecre(673,9)magnet,(916,6), if at
all possible, can(857,6)be effec(657,6) an undertaking such as mine.

letter(811,6)I feel my heart glow(896,6)an enthusiasm(423,7)elevates me
to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise(291,6)ind as
a steady purpose—a point on(540,7)the soul may fix its intellectual
eye. This(727,12)has been the favourite dream of my early years. I
have read(257,7)rdou(582,6)accounts(480,8)va(936,12)s(709,7)have
been made i(123,6)prospect of arriving a(785,6)North Pacific Ocean

history of(940,8)(169,9)made for(366,8)s(1022,14)compos(583,6)
whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My educ(627,7)as neglected,
yet I was passionately fond of reading. (729,6)volumes were my study

whose effu(70,6)entranced my(815,6)and lifted it (943,9). I also
became a poet and for one year lived(193,6)paradise(823,7)own creation;
I imagin(371,8)(94,6) might obtain a nich(787,9)temple where the

But just(923,6)a(371,6) I inherit(788,6) fortun(265,8)cousin(658,8)
thought(703,7)turned into the channel of their earlier bent.

Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I
can, even now, remembe(585,6)hour from(782,6) I dedicated myself to this
great enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I
accompani(310,7)whale-fishers on several expeditions(125,6)e North Sea;
I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst(387,6)want of sleep; I often
worked harder tha(645,6)common sailors d(210,6)the day and devo(286,6)

must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered m(904,6)second
dignity i(413,6)vessel and entre(678,6)e to remain(1003,6)(265,12)

And(814,6)dear Margaret, do I not deserve to (729,6)lish som(389,7) purpose?
My life(429,7)have been(972,8)in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to
every enticement that wealth plac(81,6)my path. Oh,(35,6)some encouraging
voice would answer(358,8)affirmative! My (52,6)(161,6)my resolution is
firm; but my hopes fluctuat(741,7)my spirits are(894,6) depressed. I am
about to proceed on a long(884,6)ifficult voyage(855,6)emergenci(828,6)which
will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to rais(636,7)(174,6)
of others(400,6)sometimes to susta(361,6)own,(719,6)their(230,6)failing.

This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly
quickly over(801,6)now(791,7)ir sledges;(102,7)(413,7) pleasant, and, in
my opinion, far more agreeable than(595,6)of an Eng(727,6)tagecoach. The
cold is not excessive, if you are wrapp(734,6)furs—a dress(421,6) I have
already adopted,(266,6)here is a(841,7)difference between walking the

I shall depart(281,8) latter town in a fortnight or three weeks;(943,7)

among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to
sail until(865,7)nth of June(259,6)when(332,7)I return? Ah, dear sister, how
can I answer this question? If I succeed, many(6,6)(114,6)s, perhaps years,
will pass before(792,6)nd I may meet.(85,6)fail, you will see me again soon,
or never.

Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,
and save me,(1012,6)(156,6)(123,6)and(133,7)testify my gratitud(514,6)all your
love and kindness.

How slowly the time passes (740,6)encompassed(658,6)am by frost and snow!
Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a

one(926,6)endeavour to sustain me in dej(748,6). I shall commit my thoughts
to paper, it is true; but(898,6)is a poor medium for the communication of
feeling. I desire(39,8)pany of a man who could sympathise(320,6)me, whose
eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I
bitterly(492,6)th(596,7)of a (473,6)(816,9)no one near me, gentle yet

and too impatie(288,6)difficulties. But(544,7)a still greater evil to me
that(792,6)self-educated:(564,9)first fourteen years of my life I ran wild
on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.
A(709,7)age I became acquainted(951,10)celebrated poe(326,6)our own
country(788,6)it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
most important benefits from(474,7) conviction(898,6)I perceived the
necessity of becoming(214,17)more languages tha(79,7)(367,6)native(220,8). Now(548,7)wenty-eight and am in reality(87,6)illiterate(88,6)many
schoolboys of fifteen. It is true(206,8)have thought(167,6)and(424,6)my
daydream(802,6)more extended and magnificent(996,6)they(981,6)(as the painters
call it) _keeping;_ and I(701,6)ly need a (845,7)who(869,7)have sense
enough not(460,6)spise me as romantic,(298,6)ffe(440,6)(52,7)for me to
endeavour to regulate my mind.

Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no(191,8)on the
wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet
some feelings, unalli(740,6)the dross of human nature, beat(115,6)in(209,6)
rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage
and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase
more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an
Englishman(514,6)(243,6) midst of national and(66,11)al prejudices,
unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of
humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;
finding(939,6)he was unemploye(224,7)is city, I easily engaged him to assist
in my(431,11).

The master(489,6)person of an excellent disposition(343,6)s remarkable(600,7)

circum(633,8)add(732,6)his well-known integrity and daunt(922,7)urage, made
me ver(645,11)to(278,7) him. A youth pass(328,6)solitude, my best years
spent under your(219,7) and feminine foste(127,6)has so refined the
groundwork of my(742,10)(472,6)I cannot overcome a(232,6)nse distaste to
the usual brutality exercised(581,10)ship: I have never believed it to be
necessary(810,6)when I heard of a mariner equally noted(481,9)kindliness
of heart(490,9)respec(16,6)obedience pai(464,7)m by his crew, I felt
myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.(191,8)
of him(886,7)in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes(164,8)the
happi(693,9)er lif(687,7), briefly, is(137,6)tory. Some(572,6) ago he loved
a young Russian(117,6)of moderate(239,7)e(400,6)having am(673,6)a considerable
sum in prize-money, the f(234,6)of the girl consent(844,6)the match. He saw
his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in
tears(585,6)throwing herself at his feet, entreated(355,6)o spare her,
confessing at the same time(808,6)s(332,8) another, but(836,6)(147,7)poor,

until he hear(652,8)is former(881,10)was(227,6)ed according(252,7)

So strange an (808,8) has(708,7)ed(710,7)that I cannot forbear
(798,6)ing it, although it is(459,6)probable(994,6)you(686,6)see me before
these papers can come into your possession.

Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice,(1022,7)closed
in the ship on all sides, scarcely leav(456,6)(687,6)sea-room in(76,6)

grow watchful with anxious (680,6)ts, when a(774,9)sight suddenly
attracted our attention and diver(27,8)solicitude from our own

dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a
being(771,7)had(765,7)ape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,

H(85,6)not, as the other traveller(957,11)be, a savage inhabitant of
some undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared (486,8)the
master said, “Here is our captain(842,6)he will not allow you to perish
o(767,6)open sea.”

On perceiving me,(584,6)tranger addressed me in English, although with a
foreign accent. “Before I come on board your(647,8)” said he,
“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”

You may conceive my astonish(595,6)n hearing such a question(230,10)
to me from a man (307,7)brink of destruc(55,6)nd to(609,6)I should have

replied, however,(946,8)(775,6)on a voyage of (679,8)y(941,9)the

Up(332,11)this he(696,10)satisfied and consen(1023,6)(523,14).
Good God! Margaret, if(518,7)d see(688,6)man who thus capitulat(274,6)

nearly froze(843,8)is body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and
suffering. I never saw(578,7)in so wretched a condition. We attempt(636,6)carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh
air he fainted(98,6)ccordingly brought him back (102,7)deck and
restored him to animation by rubbing him(1016,6)brandy and forc(28,8)to

Two days passed in(784,6)manner before he was able to speak(614,6)I often

had(622,6)me measur(228,11), I remo(71,8)to my own(610,6) and
attended on him as much as my duty(853,7)permit(750,17)ore

wildness(902,6)even ma(18,7)but there are moments when, if anyone
performs an act of kindness towards(328,6)r doe(12,6)any the most

and mind whose(996,7)ation evidently dep(784,6)upon entire repose.
Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far(79,6)the ice
in so strange a vehicle.

His(625,14)nstantly assumed an aspe(742,6)the deepest gloom, and
he replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”

“And did(782,6)an whom you pursued travel i(193,6)same fashion?”

“Yes.”

“Then I fancy we(1016,6)seen him, for(176,6)ay before we picked you up we
saw some dogs drawing a sledg(872,7) a man in it, across(349,8).”

This arouse(215,6)(363,7)r’s attention(832,6)he(440,7)a multitude of
(654,9) concerning the route which(383,6)æmon, as he called(240,6)had

sacrifice my fortune, my existenc(14,7)very hope,(152,8)furth(171,7)(366,7)nterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small pri(236,6)pay for

fast from between his fingers; a groan bur(40,8)his heaving breast. I
paused; at length he(311,8)in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you
share my madness? Have you drunk also(924,8)intoxicating draught? Hear me;
let me reveal my tale(301,6)you will dash the cup(260,6)your lips!”

Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the
paroxysm of grief(507,7)ad seized the stranger overcame his weakened
power(490,8)any hours of repos(726,10)quil conversation were
necessary to restor(98,6)composure.

me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it

I am by birth a Genevese(523,6)my family is one of the most

therefore, in this narration, to state(479,7)fac(478,8) l(885,6)my

your time(209,6)this; it is sad trash.”

If, instead(570,6)is remark,(199,10) had taken the pains to explain to me

When I(344,7)ed home my first care was to procur(606,6)whole work(611,7)is

The untaught peasant behel(687,6)elements around him(461,6)(150,14)(909,8)ir practical uses. The most learned(232,10)er knew little
more. He had partially unveil(830,7)face of Nature, but her immortal

ignorantly I had repined.

studies. My father was not scientific(278,8)was lef(684,6)truggle(94,6)a

Under the guidan(912,6)my new preceptors I(615,6)ed(213,6)the(248,6)est
diligence into(307,6)earch of the philosopher’s stone(833,6)he elixir
of life(418,6)the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an
inferior object,(502,7)at glory w(556,6)tte(132,7)discovery if I could
banish disease(875,6)the (897,6)fram(197,6)render man invulnerable to any but
a violent death!

Nor(869,6)these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils(234,6)
promise liberally accorded by(623,13) authors, the fulfilment of which
I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations(188,6)always unsuccessful, I
attribut(858,7)failure r(741,6)(776,6)own inexperienc(527,6)mistake than to a
wa(163,6)skill or fidelity in(148,6)structors. And thus for a time(936,6)
occupi(278,6)exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand
contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of
multifarious(904,10), gui(439,7)an ardent imagination and childish
reasoning, till an accident again chang(385,7)curr(491,7)my ideas.

When(287,6) about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near
Belrive, when we witnessed a(591,6)(760,8)and terrible thunderstorm. It
advanced(869,6)behi(921,7)mountains of Jura,(74,6)h(69,9) burst at once
with frightful loudness(958,6)v(375,7)quarters of(978,6)eavens. I remained,
while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue(281,6)an
old and beautiful oak(962,6)(99,8)bout twenty yard(253,7)(443,9)(980,6)so
soon as(146,6)azzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared(392,6)nothing
(310,8) but a b(300,6) stump. W(541,7)visited i(261,6)next mor(712,6)we found
the tree shattered(840,6)singular manner. It was not splin(44,6)by the
shock, but entirely reduc(712,6)thin ribbo(603,6)wood. I never(395,7)
anything so utterly destroyed.

Before this(841,7)not unacquainted(535,6)(713,6)re obvious laws of

the explanation of a theory(603,7)he had formed on(792,6)ubject(202,15) and galvanism,(668,7)was(932,8) new and astonishing to me.
All that he said threw(258,6)ly into(915,6)hade Cornelius Agrippa,
Albertus Magn(267,8)Paracelsus(720,6)lords of my imagi(248,6); but by
some fatality(770,6)verthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my
accustom(776,6)dies. It seem(644,6)me as if(838,8) would or could ever
be known. (283,10)ad so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
despicable. By one(196,6)ose caprices(214,7) mind(433,8)e are perhaps
most(497,9)to in early youth, I(478,9)gave up my(559,6)r

Thus strangely are our souls constructed(839,6)by such slight ligaments
are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I look back, i(781,6)s(1020,6)

My(853,7)ure for Ingolstadt,(446,7)had been deferred by these events,
was now again determined upon. I obtained(629,6)my f(460,7) respite of
some weeks. It appeared to me (403,9) so soon to leav(859,8)pose,
akin to death,(805,7) hou(845,6)mourning(1017,6)o rush in(985,7)thick of

She indeed veiled her(852,7)and strove to ac(206,6)comforter to us all.
She looked steadily on life(176,6)ssumed its (764,8)ith courage and
zeal. She devot(139,6)self(728,6)ose(689,6)sh(842,6)been ta(826,8)call

when she recalled(410,6)unshine of her smiles(292,6)pent them upon us(273,6)forgot even her own regret i(18,6)endeavours to make us forget.

The day of m(905,12)at length arrived. Clerval(140,10) last

We sat late. We could(79,6)ear ourselves away(247,6)each other nor

retired under the pretence of seeking repose,(128,6)fancying that the

I threw myself in(581,7)chaise(363,6)(278,21)(697,7)dulged in
the most melancholy reflections. I, who had ever been surrounded by
amiable companions, continually enga(111,6) endeavouring(266,11)mutual
pleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither (43,6)going I
must form my own(307,7)s and be(22,8)protector. My life had (83,6)to
been remarkably secluded and domestic(790,6)this had given me invincible
repugnance to new countenances. I loved my brothers,(608,10), and
(662,7); these(721,6)“old familiar faces,” but I belie(85,6)self
totally unfitted fo(955,6)(431,6)y of strangers. Such(822,6)m(522,13) as
I commenc(179,6)journey(958,6)as I proceeded, my spirit(380,6)hopes rose. I
ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had(835,6), when at home,
thought it hard to remain d(613,6)my youth cooped up in one plac(856,6)had
longed to ente(290,6)worl(500,6)take my station among other human beings.
Now m(217,8)s(431,6)complied wi(470,7) it would, indeed, have(862,6)folly to

(434,7) to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. At length the
high white steeple of the town met my ey(735,6)alight(825,7)was
conduct(362,6)my solitary apartment to spen(533,6)evening(607,7)leased.

The next morning I deliver(846,6)letters of introduc(440,6)nd paid a visit to
som(196,9)principal professors. Chance—or rath(541,7)evil
influence, the Angel of Destr(116,6)(351,8)asserted omnipotent sway over me
from the moment I turn(875,6)reluctant steps from my father’s
door—led me first to M. Krempe,(207,10) of natural philosophy. He
was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He
ask(137,6)several ques(651,6)conce(434,6)my progress(84,8)different branches
of(91,8) appertaining to(198,21)I re(875,6)carelessly, and
partly in contempt, mentione(619,6)names of my alchemists as(538,14)
authors (917,7)tudied. The(358,11)stared. “Have you,” he
said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”

(219,10)(386,7)affirmative. “Every minute,” continued(517,10) with
warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly
and entirely lost. Y(61,8)burdened(217,6)memory with exploded systems
and useless(383,6). Good God! In what desert land(158,6)you lived,
where no one was kind enough to inform you(226,6)these fancies(921,7)you

sir, you must begin(613,6)(684,6)s(442,10)anew.”

So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of(990,9)books
treating of(922,19)(363,7)he desired me to procure(931,6)dismiss(29,6)after(930,8)ing(674,6)(763,7)beginn(110,7)the following

considered(973,7)authors(889,9)whom the (185,9) reprobated; but I
(134,9)not at all the more inclin(364,6)recur to(875,7)(627,8)in any

Beside(159,9)a contempt(66,9)us(99,6)(341,7)(327,7)(562,10)y.
It was very different when(829,6)aste(389,6)the (385,7) sought
immortality and power;(317,6)views, although futile, were gran(953,7)now
(91,6)en(877,6)(300,7). The ambit(482,7)the(295,9) seem(976,6)limit
itself(983,7) annihila(59,10)ose vi(729,6)on which my interest in(608,8)(134,7)iefly founded. I was requir(121,6)(471,8) chimeras of
boundless(229,6)eur for realit(499,7)little worth.

Such(280,6)my reflections dur(879,7) first two or three day(478,6)y
residence at Ingolstadt,(231,7)were(209,9)sp(623,6) becoming
acquainted(928,10)loc(177,8)and(728,6)rincipal (111,7)ts in my new
abode. But as the ensuing week commenced, I (531,6)t(468,10)formation
(408,6)M. Krempe had given me concern(276,8)lectures. And(618,10)I
could not consent to go and hear that(390,8)conceited fellow deliver
sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what h(172,6)said of M.
Waldman, whom(933,7)nev(700,6)n, as(53,8)hitherto been(110,8)town.

Partly from curios(878,9)(26,11)idleness, I w(480,6)(778,7)(293,6)ing
room(530,8)M. (159,7) entered shortly after. This professor was very
unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but(610,6)an
aspect expressive(994,8)greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his
temples(97,6)(1003,6)at the back of his head(871,6)nearly black. His person
was(264,6) but remarkably erect(576,6)is voice the sweetest(479,7)ever heard.
He began his(683,8) by a recapitulation(774,8)history of chemistry and
the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing
with fervour the names(901,8)most distinguished dis(358,6)rs. He then took
a cursory view(968,8)present stat(463,9)science and explained many of
its elementary terms. After having(230,6)(511,6)preparatory experiments, he
concluded(610,7) panegyric upon modern(347,10), the(113,6) of(791,7)I
shall(935,7)forget:

“The ancient teache(726,6)this(226,8),”(1021,6)he,
“promised impossibilities(953,6)erformed nothing. The(162,8)masters
(67,7) very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that
the elixir of life is a chimera(821,7)ese philosophers, whose hands seem
only(629,6)to dabble in dirt,(111,7)eir eyes to pore ove(621,6)microscope or
crucible, have indee(281,12)miracles. They penetrate into the recesses
of natur(611,6)show how she works in her hiding-plac(88,9)ascend(85,9)
heavens(360,7)have(773,10)d how the blood circulates(253,9)(137,8)of
the air we breathe(203,7)have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;
they can comm(103,8)thund(643,7)(179,6), mimic the earthquake(406,6)even
mock the invisible worl(814,7)its own shadows.”

Such were(987,7)ofessor’s words—rather let me say such t(375,6)ds(261,8)fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul
were grappling(989,10)lpable enemy; one by on(175,6)various keys were
touched(1000,7)(895,7)the mechanism of my being; chord after(12,7)was
sounded(750,6)soon my mind was fille(338,7)(138,6)ought, one conception,
one purpose. So much has been done, exclai(166,8)soul of
Frankenstein—more, far (10,6)will I achieve; treading in(69,6)teps
already marked, I(56,6)pioneer a new way, explore unknown(660,7), and
unfold (909,7)(587,6)the deepest mysteries of creation.

I closed not my eyes that night. My internal(396,6) was in a state of
insurrection(892,6)urmoil;(579,8)that order wou(155,6)nce arise, but I
had no(874,6) to produce it. By degrees,(517,7)the morning’s dawn,
sleep came. I awo(883,8)my yesternight’s(523,8)(653,6) as a dream.
There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies(256,6)o
devote myself to a science for(760,7)I believed(41,11)possess a
natural talent. O(568,7)ame day I paid M. Waldman a visit. His
manners in private(239,6)even more mild and attractive than in public,
for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture(993,7)in
his own hous(76,6)replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. I
gave him pretty nearl(63,6)same account of my former pursuits as I had
given to his fellow professor. He heard with atten(508,6)he little
narration concerning my(519,13)smiled at the nam(895,6)Cornelius
Agrippa and Paracelsus(785,6)withou(59,6)contemp(841,7)M. Krempe had
exhibited. He said(960,6)“Thes(498,7)m(237,6)whose indefatigable zeal
modern philosopher(794,7)indebted for most of the foundations(19,7)ir
knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new(289,6)
and arrange in connected classific(119,7)the facts(845,7)they in a
great degree had bee(827,6)instruments of bringing to light. The
labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
fail in ultimately tu(552,6)to(969,6)olid advantage of mankind.” I
listened(680,8)statement,(854,7)was delivere(684,6)out any presumption
or affectation, and then adde(557,7)(946,12)had removed my
prejudices against (559,7)chemists; I expressed myself in measured
terms,(845,6)the modes(989,7)deference due from a youth(927,7)
(436,6)ctor(67,6)out letting escape (inexperience in life would have
made me ashamed) any(715,8)enthusiasm(585,7)stimulated my intended(534,8). I requested his advice conce(480,7)he books I ought to
procure.

“I am happy,”(947,6)M. Waldman, “to have gained a
disciple; and if your appl(782,7) equals(24,7)bility, I(71,6)no doubt of
your success. C(450,6)ry is(521,6)branch of natural philosophy in(875,10)(869,6)est improve(853,6)have(879,6)and may be made; it is on(626,6)account that
(169,7)made it my peculiar study; but at(822,6)ame time(225,11)t
neglected the other(205,7)es of science. A man(540,7)make(91,6) very sorry

wish is to become really a man(153,11) and not merely a petty
(728,6)mentalist, I should advise you to apply to every(456,18)

He then took me in(901,6) laborator(950,6)expl(669,6)to me the us(362,6)his
various machines, (966,8)ing(905,6) to what(803,11) (803,7) and

the(358,9)not to derange their mechanism. He also gave(217,8)list of
(978,6)(770,6)I had requested, and I(312,7)y leave.

Thus (575,6)a day memorable(313,6); it decided my future destiny.




Chapter 4


From this day(931,19)(136,6)particularly (718,7)ry, in the
most comprehensive sen(350,6)the term, became nearly my sole occupation.
I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,
(336,6)modern inquirers(985,6)written on these subjects. I(921,11)he

and real inform(232,6) combined, it is true,(317,7) repulsive
physiognom(874,6)manners, but not(268,6)at account(674,6)ess valuable. In
M. Waldman(197,9)a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by
dogmatism(735,6)his(967,10)ons were given(517,7)n air of frankness and
good(685,6)e(188,6)banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways
he smoothed for(925,8)path of knowledge(310,7)d(956,6)most abstruse
(607,6)ies clear and faci(911,7)y ap(789,8)on. My application was at
first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and
soon(869,8)so ardent and eager(485,6)the stars often disappeared(974,8)light of morning whilst I was yet engag(49,6)my laboratory.

As I(228,6)ed so closely, it may be easily conceived(638,6)my progress
was rapid(306,6)rdour was inde(900,8)stonishment(900,8)students, and
(82,6)ficiency(740,6)(941,8)asters. Professor(903,8)(278,6)asked me,
(847,7)sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on,(301,8)(815,10)
express(184,7)most heartfelt exult(526,6)(334,6)(261,8). Two years

(439,7),(127,6) and soul,(505,7) pursuit of some discoveries(101,8)
hoped to make. None but those who have experienc(430,6)m can(498,9)
(431,7)enticements of science. In other studies you go as far as
others(107,6)gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
a(116,6)tific(254,9)(59,9)continual food for(274,9)y and wonder.
A mind(818,6)derate capacity(413,7)(774,7)(354,6)es on(685,6)y must
infallibly arrive at great(706,13)in(964,6)study; and I, who
(171,9)ly sough(1001,6)attain(802,8)one object of(493,9)and was
solely wrapped up(623,8), improv(976,6)rapidl(846,7)a(103,6)e(253,6)two
years I made(581,18)(616,7)(80,7)(954,8)some chemical
instrum(967,6)(731,6)procured me(278,7)esteem and admir(833,6)(143,6)
university. When I had(346,7)d(181,6)is poin(773,6)had become as well
acquainted with the theo(506,7)practice of natural philosophy as
depended o(860,6)lessons of any (770,7)professors at Ingolstadt, my
residence(718,7)being no longer conducive to my(343,12)s, I thought
of returning(43,7)friends and my nat(71,6)wn, when an incident
happened(637,6)protracted my stay.

One(211,9)henomena(763,7)had peculiarly at(62,11)attention was
the structur(79,9)human frame, and, indeed, any animal endu(426,7)
life(504,6)ce, I often asked myself, did(383,7)inciple of life proceed?
It was a bold question, and one(221,9)s ever been considered as a
mystery; yet(583,6)how many things are we up(550,7)brink of(655,6)ing(649,11), if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
inquiries. I revolved these circumstanc(923,6)my mind and determined
thenceforth to apply(330,7) more particularly to those branches of
(803,19)(986,6)relate to physiology. Unless(951,7)been
animated by an almost super(895,8)enthusiasm, my application(148,6)is
study would have(438,6)irksome and(89,8)intolerable. To examine the
causes(561,8), we must first(87,6)recourse to death. I became(464,11)(530,6)the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I
must also observe the (360,8)decay and corruption(849,14)body.
In my edu(297,7)my father had take(663,6)greatest precautions that my
mind should be impress(224,8)no(423,14)horrors. I do not ever
remember to(411,6)trembled at a ta(932,6)supersti(209,6)(46,10)fear(683,6) appar(33,7)f a spirit. Darkness had no effect(891,6)my fancy, and
a churchyard was to me merely the receptac(149,6)bodies deprived of
(539,7)hich, from being(494,6)eat(995,6)aut(422,6)strength,(754,7)come

fine form of ma(121,6)degraded and wasted; I beheld(271,6)(762,12)
death succe(314,6)the blooming cheek(979,8);(128,14) worm

from life to death, and(11,6) to (636,6)until(635,6)(106,6)dst(368,6)is

wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity
(512,7)prospect(817,6) it illustrated,(754,7)surprised(99,6)among so
many men of genius who had direc(436,7)ir inquiries towards(911,6)ame
scienc(191,8)I alone should be reserv(884,6)discover so astonishing a
secret.

Remember, I am not recording the vis(665,6) a madman. The sun does not
more certainly shine(525,8)heavens than(372,9)ch I now affirm is
true. Some miracle might have produced it(457,6)the stage(732,8)

incredible labour and fatigue, I(915,8)(743,6)(347,8)(295,8)cause of
generation and(935,7)nay, more,(619,10)myself capable of bestowing

What(86,9)(676,7)udy and(246,7)(686,7) wisest men since(582,6)reation
(37,8)orld was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it
all opened(585,6)m(408,9): the infor(618,7)(572,6)obtaine(117,6)of a
nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them
towards the objec(523,8)search than to exhibi(214,6)(41,8)already
accomplished. I was(248,6)the Arabian who(384,10)buried with the dead
and found a passage to life, aide(471,7)by one glimm(1000,6)and seemingly
ineffectual light.

I see by your eagerness and(464,7)nder and hope(950,7)(45,6)yes
express, my friend,(706,6)you expect to b(442,8)ed(591,8)secret with

precepts, at leas(25,7) example, how dangerous i(688,6)acquirement of

When I(735,7)so astonishing a power plac(789,7)in my hands, I hesitated
a long time concerning the manner in(701,7)(1006,9)employ it.
Although I possesse(768,6)capacity of bestow(856,6)imation, yet to
prepare a frame for the (449,6)ion of it,(987,6)all its intricacies of
fibres, muscles(709,6)veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether(271,10)attempt the
crea(182,8)a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my
imagin(75,6)was too(637,6)exalted(719,7)(146,6)success to permit me to
doubt (990,6)ability to give life to an(405,6)l as complex and wonderful
as man. The materials at present(609,11)command hardly appeared
adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but(370,11)not(868,6)(633,8)
ultimately(244,6)ed. I (579,7)d(356,7) for a multitude of reverses; my
operations might be incessantly baffled(582,6)at last my(569,6)be
imperfect(709,6)w(906,6)consider(768,7)improvement(831,7)every day takes
place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my(378,8)
(635,7)s w(650,7) least lay the found(236,7)of future(560,8). Nor
could(192,11)(1019,7)gn(317,6)and(535,8)(974,7)my plan as any
argument(936,6)s impractic(626,7). It was(961,6)these feelings(479,7)
began the (832,14)human(838,6). As(155,6)inuteness of the parts
formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary(34,7)first
intention, to make the(970,7)of a gigantic stature,(677,6)is to say,
about eight feet in height(596,6)proportionably large. After having(206,8)this determin(281,6)(863,6)ving spent some months in(477,8)fully
collecting(717,6)rranging my(971,10), I began.

No one can conceiv(256,6)varie(512,6)(445,9)(727,6)bore me onwards, like
a hurricane, i(476,6)first enthusiasm of(651,10)Lif(770,6)death
appear(757,6)me ideal bounds,(848,7)I should(88,7)break through, and
pour a torr(673,7)light into our dark world. A new specie(848,8)bless
me as its(670,6)or and source; many happy and excellent natur(75,8)
owe their(587,7)to me. No father (904,6)claim the grat(899,6)of his
child so(911,7)tely as(263,10)deser(431,6)irs. Pursuing(884,6)
reflections, I thought(700,7)f I(129,7)bestow anim(905,6)upon life(268,6)atter, I m(331,7) proc(910,8)ime (al(93,6) I now found it impossible)
renew life where(503,6) had apparently devoted(898,6)ody to corruption.

These(204,8)s supported(1010,6)irit(559,6)le I pursu(28,6)undertaking
with unremit(810,6)rdour. My cheek had grown pale with study(975,6)my
person had become emaciated(47,6)confinement. Sometimes, o(795,6)very
brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clu(579,6)the hope(908,7)the
next day or the next hour(434,7)realise. One secret(849,9)alone
possessed was(99,10)to(889,9)had dedica(364,6)self; an(426,6)moon
gazed on my midnight labour(403,8),(330,6)unrelaxed and breathless
eagerness,(445,11)(854,6) to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive
(290,6)rrors of my(244,8)toil(832,6)dabbled amo(814,6) unhallowed damps
of(916,8)ve or tortur(666,7)living(819,6)l to(829,7)e(29,7)(826,7)clay? My limbs now tremble(582,8) eyes swim(611,6)the remembrance; but
then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed
to have lost all soul or sens(1018,6)but for this one(833,6)it. It was
indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel(829,6)renewed
acuteness so soon as,(386,7)natural stimulus cea(97,6)o operate,(651,6)
returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and
disturbed(663,7)profane finger(151,7)tremendous(827,7)s (539,7)human
frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at(85,6)op(70,9)ouse,
and separated(178,6)all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
I kept my worksh(105,6)filthy creation;(635,7)balls were starting from
their sockets in attend(396,7)the detail(865,8)employment. The
dissecting room an(824,6)slaughter(391,6) furnished many(942,7)materials;
and often did my(372,6) nature turn(824,6)loath(190,8) my occupation,
whilst, still(801,7)on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I
brough(346,9) near to a conclusion.

The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart(456,6)oul, in
(891,19) a most beautiful season; never di(355,6)fields
bestow a more plen(53,6)harvest or the vines yield(44,8)luxuriant
vintage, but(562,7)(558,7)insensible(528,8)charms of(413,7). A(500,6)
same feeling(358,8)made me neglec(788,6)scenes around me caused me also
to forget those friends who(707,7)o(582,6)miles absent, and whom I had
not seen for so long a time. I knew my silence disquieted them(79,6)I
well remember(28,6) word(784,8)father: “I know that(514,7)you are
pleased(704,6)yourself you will think of us(739,6)affection(211,7)e shall
hear regularly(769,6)you. You must pardon me if I regard any
interruption in your correspondence as a proof(198,6)your other duties
are eq(819,6)(465,7)ed.”

(335,7)well therefore what would be(301,10)’s(549,9)(625,6)I coul(434,6)tear my thoughts(1000,9)employment, loathsome in itself(699,6)which
had taken an irresistible hold(441,7)imagination. I wished, as it
were, to procrastinate all(481,6)related to my(755,10)of(445,10)
until the great object,(792,7)swallowed up every habit(599,7)(859,6),
sh(319,8)completed.

I then(292,8)(628,6)(652,9)(370,10)unjust if he ascribed m(444,9)
to vice or faultiness on my part(415,8)am now convinced(742,6)he was
justified in conceiving(778,6)I (194,7)not be altogether free from
blame. A human being in per(778,7) (233,6)always(408,6)eserve a calm and
peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
disturb his tranquillity. I do not(943,7)that the pursu(439,6)knowledge
is an exce(881,6)to this rule. If the study to(529,7)you apply yourself
has a tendenc(43,6)eake(958,7)(618,9)s and to destro(65,6) taste for
those simple pleasures in(651,7)n(288,6)y can possibly mix,(615,8)at

country, America(39,12)been discovered more gradually,(431,6)he
empires of Mexico and Peru(146,14)(472,7)ed.

But I forge(1017,7)I am moraliz(825,7)the most(284,6)esting part of my
tale(135,6)your looks remind me(864,6)oceed.

My father made no reproach in his letter(646,6)only took notice(113,7)silence by inquir(994,6)to my occupa(714,6)more particularly than before.
Winter, spring(330,6)summer passed away during my labours; but I did not
watc(555,6)blossom or the expanding leaves—sights(932,7)(135,6)(687,7)
yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my
(243,10). The(109,7) of(843,6)year had withered(122,8)my work drew near
to a clos(465,7)now every day show(162,6)(345,6)l(954,6)how well I had
succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiet(712,7)I appeared

unwholesome trade(513,6)an artist(558,6)i(141,6)his favourite employment.
Every night I was oppress(198,6)a slow fever(200,8)became nervous to a most
painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled m(856,7)I shunned my fellow
creatures as if(381,6)(994,6)guilty(81,6)crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at

Chapter 5


It(497,6)n a drea(521,9)of November(301,8)behe(175,6) accomplishment
(304,6)toils. With an(763,8)(934,6)almost amounted to agony, I
collecte(91,6)instruments of life aroun(561,6)(441,7)might infuse a
spark of being into the lifeless thing(502,6)lay at(620,6)et. (259,6)
already one(884,9)orning(710,6)rain pattered dismally against the
panes(1003,6)my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer(459,7)
half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye(517,7)(507,6)ure
open; it breathed har(668,7)a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.

How can I describe my e(51,6)s at this catastrophe, or how delineate(895,8)tch whom with such infinite pains and care(1003,7)endeavoured to
form? Hi(158,7) were in proportion(889,8)had se(593,7)his f(276,6)s as
beautiful. B(11,8)! Great God! His(344,8)skin scarcely covered(208,6)o(621,6)muscle(187,6)arteries beneath; his hair(865,6)f a lustrous
black(553,6)flowing(47,6)tee(978,6)a p(563,6)whiteness; but(1002,6)
luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast(371,6)his watery eyes,
that seemed(926,8)(582,7)same colour as(624,7)n-white sockets in which
they(399,6)set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.

The different accid(1023,15)e not so changeable(155,8)feelings
of human nature.(585,7)work(768,7) for(908,8)two years, for(248,6)ole
purpose of infusing(133,6)into an inanimate body. For(776,6)I had
deprived myself of rest and health(153,8)desired i(418,7)an ardour(411,6)far exceeded moderation(520,6)now that(813,7)finished, the beauty
(462,7)dream va(34,8)and breathless horror and disgust filled my
heart. Unable to endure the aspec(564,9)being(955,7)created, I
rushed ou(605,9)room(1004,6)ontinued a long time traversing my
bed-chamber, u(134,9)compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude
suc(326,7)to the tumul(315,8)before(217,7)(287,7)I threw(451,9)n the
bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few mom(708,8)forgetfulness.
But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest
dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in(529,6)loom of(641,7), walking in
the stree(880,6)Ingolstadt. Delighted(955,6)urprised, I embraced her,
but as I imprinted(922,6)irst kiss on her lips, they became livid with
the hue of death; her features appear(454,6)change(429,10)(255,6)(785,6)
hel(128,6)corp(970,6)my dead mother(454,7)arms; a shroud envelop(212,6)
form(525,8)saw the grave-worms crawl(323,6)(236,6)olds(781,8)flannel.
I started from my(680,6)(1008,6)(890,6); a cold dew covered my forehead, my
teeth chatte(678,9)every limb(333,8)convulsed; when,(562,8)dim and
yellow ligh(953,9)moon, as it forced its way through(629,7)ndow
shutters, I be(362,9)wretch—the miserable monster whom(877,6)
created. He held up(426,6)urtain(320,8)bed; and his eyes, if eyes they
may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws open(982,8)he mu(321,6) some
inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkle(137,6)cheeks. He might have
spoken(945,8)did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to
detain me(1017,8)escap(889,7)rushed downstair(1011,6)ook refuge(998,7)
courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained
during the res(550,9)night, walking up an(147,6)(769,8)greatest
agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each(389,6) as if
it(473,6)to announce the approach(877,8)demoniacal(1009,8)to(235,8)
had so(661,9)y given life.

Oh! No mortal could support(311,7)rror(982,6)at countenance. A mummy
again endued(984,6)animation(82,7)not be so hideous as(81,6)(823,6).(168,7)gaz(706,6)him(647,7)unfinished; he was ugly t(990,6)ut when those
muscles and joints(794,6)rendered capable of mo(418,6)it became a thing
such as even Dante(199,11)have conceived.

I passed(549,10)(213,7)edly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and
hardly(357,6)I fel(383,6)palp(588,7) of every artery; at others, I nearly
sank(755,8)ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingl(448,7)
this(507,7),(143,12)bitterness of disappointment; dream(472,7)had
been my foo(967,6)pleasant(856,6)for so long a space(751,6)now become a
hell to me; an(358,6)chang(524,6)so rapid, the overthrow so complete!

Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawne(167,6)discovered to my
sleeples(601,6)a(954,6)eyes(142,7)ur(908,6)Ingolstadt, its white steeple
and clock,(924,7)indicat(571,7)sixth hour. The porter open(605,7)gates
(1012,7)court(74,8)had(928,6)(640,6)(377,8)asylum, and I issued into
the streets, pacing them(959,6)quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the
(958,6) whom I feared(677,7)turning (175,7)(109,6) would present(350,7)view. I di(866,6)dare return(714,8)apartment(314,7)I inhabited, but
felt impell(438,6)hurry on, although drenched by the rain(394,7)poured
from a black and comfortless sky.

I continued walking in this manner(728,7)me time, endeavouring by
bodily exercise to ease the lo(457,8)weighed upon my mind. I
travers(564,8)(451,6) without any clear conception of where I was or
what(14,7)doing. My heart palpitated(215,6)e sick(1010,8)fear(591,7)
hurried on(565,6)irregular(569,8)(460,7)ing to look about me:

 Like one who, on a lonely road,
 Doth walk in fear(925,6)read,
 And, having once turned round, walks on(42,6) turns no more his head;
 Because he knows a frightful fiend(137,7)close behind him tread.

 [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]



C(565,6)(871,6)us, I came at length opposite(755,8)inn a(752,8)the various
diligences(675,6)arriages usually stopped. H(501,6)paused, I knew not why;
but I remained(691,6)minute(593,6) my eyes fix(488,6)a coach(674,7)as coming
towards me from the other end of(684,11). As it drew nearer I observed
that i(93,6)the Swiss (243,9); it(224,8) just(730,13)standing, and
o(703,6)door being open(265,6)perceived Henry Clerval,(652,9)seeing me,
instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,
“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate(1012,6)you should be here at
the very moment of my alighting!”

Nothing could equal my delight(208,11)(232,7); his presence brought back
to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear(74,7)recollection. I grasped(900,6)and(77,6)in a(225,8)forgot my horror
and mis(302,6)e; I felt suddenly(143,6)for the first time during many months,
calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, i(588,6)most cordial
manner(268,6)we walked (779,9)y college.(606,8) continued talking for
some(176,6)about our mutual(138,7)(1000,6)his own good(569,7)e in(731,6)
permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said
he, (685,6)re(988,7)the difficulty to persuade(533,10)(696,6)all
necessary knowledge was not comprised(328,8)noble art of book-keeping;
and, inde(937,6)(167,7) I left him incredulous to the last, for his co(946,6)
answer (722,6)unwearied entreaties(232,9)same as(903,6)of the Dutch
schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins
a year without Greek, I eat heartily(30,14).’ But his
aff(830,6) for me at length overcame his dislike of learning(937,6)he has(547,11)(542,6)undertake a voyage of discovery(348,10)nd of
(471,9).”

“It gives me the(567,6)est delight to see you; but tell me how you left
(584,9), brothers(973,6)Elizabeth.”

“Very well(1002,6)very happy, only a little uneasy(661,6)they hear from
you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you(84,11)pon their
account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,”(1004,11)he, stopping
short and gazing full in(851,6)ce, “I did not before remark how(251,6)ill
you appear; so thin and pale;(353,6)ook as if you had been watching for
several nights.”

“You(714,6)guessed right; (736,7)lately(75,6)so deeply engag(992,6)one
occupation(850,6)(796,7)not allowed(324,7) sufficient rest, as you see;
but I hope, I sincerely(18,7)that all these employments are now at an
end and(139,8)am(834,11)free.”

I trembled excessively; I coul(399,6)endure(792,6)ink of(864,6)far less to
allude to, the occurrences of the preceding(373,6). I walked with a
quick pace(959,6)we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and
the thought made me shiver(313,7)the creature whom I had left(656,6)
apartment might still be there, alive(163,6)alking about. I dreaded to
behold this monster, (474,6)feared(88,7)more(954,6)Henry should see him.
Entreating him,(133,6)fore, to remain a few minutes (231,7)bottom(384,7)

fearfully in: the (568,10)was empty(809,6)my bedroom(341,7)so freed
from its hideous guest.(895,9)hardly believ(551,7)so great a good
fortune(50,9)ve befallen me(628,6)when I became assured(785,6)my enemy
had indeed fled, I clapped m(531,6)s for joy and ran down to Clerval.

We ascended into my room(980,6)the servant presently br(945,6)breakfast;
(809,6)was unable to contain(608,10)(361,6)not joy only(996,6)possessed
me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness(439,9)pulse
beat rapidly.(151,17)(899,7)for a s(93,6)instant i(600,6)same

(532,9)he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes
for which h(640,8)not account(765,9)loud, unrestrained, heartless
laughter frightened and astonished him.

“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,
is the matter? Do not(339,6)(412,6)at manner. How ill you are! What (66,6)
cause of all this?”

“(80,7)ask me(144,9)I, putting(825,10)before(313,8)(169,6)I

Poor(1008,8)(292,7)must have bee(618,6)feelings? A meeting,(555,9)
anticipated(904,6)such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I

recover my senses(963,7)long, long time.

This wa(588,6)commencement of a nervous feve(784,8)confin(853,6)for
several months. During(590,7)at time Henry was my only nurse. I

action(862,6)he(193,7)to(424,6)them.

But(646,7)in reality very ill(378,6)surely nothing bu(940,6)unbounded and
unremitting(267,8)ons(218,7)friend(322,7)have restor(641,6)to life.
The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence wa(798,6)ever

indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.

B(526,7)slow degre(340,8)with frequent relapses(814,6)alarm(538,7)gr(295,6)(520,9), I(748,8)ed. I remember the(349,7)time I became
capable of observing outward objects(316,6)any(915,6)of pleasure, I
percei(430,6)a(704,6)fallen leaves had disappear(724,6)(43,10)young

a divine spring(867,6)the season contributed greatly to my
convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in
my bosom; my gloom(247,12)(1009,6)in a shor(392,15) as
cheerful as (874,7)I was attacked by(351,7)tal passion.

“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how(629,6)good
you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you
promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever
repay you? I feel the(428,6)est remorse fo(721,6)(598,6)ointment of(993,9)have(126,6)the occasion, but you will forgive me.”

“Y(24,8)(134,6)me entirely if you do not discompose(239,11)but get

may speak to you on one subject, may I not?”

I trembled. O(38,10)! What could it be? Could he allude to an(1001,7) on
whom I dared not even think?

“C(248,16)” said(634,9) who observ(931,6)change of

“If this is(364,6)present temper, my(95,7),(826,10)perhaps be glad

my convalescence had commenc(659,8)proceeded regularly. In another

Summer passed away(658,7)se occupations(1003,6)my return to Geneva was

our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of

“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”



Clerval, who had watched my counten(400,6)s I read this letter, was
surprised to observe the despair(722,6)succeeded the joy I at first
expressed on receiving news from my (370,6)s. I threw the(136,7) on the
table(950,6)cover(199,6)face(566,6)my hands.

“My(791,6)(302,12),” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me
weep(649,6)bitter(627,6)“are you always to be(998,8)? (114,8)(571,7)
what has happened?”

I motioned him to take up(239,11), while I walked up and dow(264,6)room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed(358,6)the eyes of(537,10)as he(507,8)e account of my misfortune.

“I can offer you no consolation,(454,10),” said he;
“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”

“To go instantly to (748,6): com(502,8)e,(461,8)to ord(985,9)rses.”

During our walk, (790,7) endeavour(733,6)say a few words of(224,12);
he could only (725,7) his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!(274,9),
“dear lovely child, he now sleeps(718,6)his angel mother! Who(877,6)had
seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his
untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How
much more a(34,8)d(171,6)(305,6)destroy radiant innocence! Poor little
fellow! one(356,6)(607,11) have we; his(869,7)s mourn and weep, but
he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
A sod cover(486,6)gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer
be a subject for pity; we(397,6)reserve(471,6)for his(379,9)e
survivors.”
(947,8) spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the(719,6)
impressed themselves on(1000,6)nd and I rememb(449,7)em afterwards in
solitude. But now, as soon as(887,11) arrived, I(159,9)into a
cabriolet(324,6)bade farewell to my(478,7).

My journey was very melancholy. At first I wish(967,6)hurry on, for I(394,6)d
to(974,7)e and(937,8)ise(879,6)my love(263,6)sorrowing(617,8); but when I
drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I(777,7)hardly sustain
(850,6)ltitude of feelings(829,7)rowd(314,8)(423,7). I pa(455,7)rough
scenes familiar(325,7)youth(1016,6)which I had not seen for nearly six years.
How altered every thing might be during(989,6)time! One sudden and
de(947,6)ng change had taken place(332,6)a thousand(1022,7) circumstances
(113,6)have by degrees worked other(168,6)ations,(228,6), alth(773,8)y were
done more tranquilly,(209,7)not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I
dared no advance, dreading(207,12)nameless evil(458,7)made me tremble,
(168,9)I was unable to define them.

I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of(556,8)
contemplat(1017,6) lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the
snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,”(84,6)not(515,7)d. By
(453,8)the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continu(851,6)journey
towards Geneva.

The road ran by the si(854,6)(247,8)(550,7) became narrower as I
approach(955,6)(983,11). I discovered(586,6)distinctl(105,6)black
sid(263,6)Jura(190,6)the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a
child. “Dear(360,10)! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your
wanderer? Your(122,7)s are clear;(286,6)ky and lake are blue and
(525,6). Is(605,6)to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”

I fear, my friend,(782,6)I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on
these preliminary circumstances; but(1006,10)(803,6)of comparative
(149,9)(595,8)think(538,7)m with pleasure. My country, my beloved
(20,7)! who but a(549,8)can tell the delight I took in again
beholding thy streams, th(849,13)and,(610,6)than all(35,6)lovely
lake!

Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear(125,6) overcame me. Night also
closed(1009,7)(1000,6)when I could hardly see(220,6)ark(1023,12)I felt still
more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim(1011,7)of evil(1007,7)
foresaw obscurely(564,8)was destined to becom(153,6)most wretched of human
beings. Alas! I prophesied truly(932,6)failed only in one single
(617,12)(699,7)in a(490,7)misery I imagined(216,6)readed, I did not
conceiv(324,6)hundredth part(644,7) anguish(230,19)endure.

It was completely(399,6)(432,7)arrived in the environs of Geneva(1012,6)gates

where my poor William had been murdered. As(740,9)not(221,8)rough the
town,(261,18)cro(262,7)lake in a boat to(386,7) at Plainpalais.
Dur(1013,6)is short voyage I saw(76,6)ightning playing o(454,6)summit of Mont
Blanc(482,8)most beautiful figures(338,7)torm(886,10)to approach
rapid(762,7), on landing, I ascended a low hill(758,7)I might observe its
progress. It advanced(614,6)heavens(604,6)clouded(991,7) soon fel(553,6)rain
coming slow(899,6)large drops, but its violence quickly increased.

I quitted my seat(987,6)walked on, alth(479,8) darkness and(302,6)
(78,9) every minute(182,6)the thunder burst with a terrific crash
over my head. (945,7)echoed(761,6)Salêve, the Juras(96,10)Alps of
Savoy; vivid flashes of(549,11)dazzl(234,6)eyes, illuminat(617,6)e
lake, making it(522,7) like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
(264,6)thing seemed of a pitchy(324,9), until the eye recovered itself
(1011,9)preceding(216,6)(684,11), as is ofte(763,6)case in
Switzerland,(722,10)at once in various parts of(641,12). The
most(574,7)t(795,7)hung exactly north(58,8)(1017,6)over(179,6)art(85,7)
lake which lies betwe(175,7)promontory of Belrive(572,9)village of

darkened(704,6)ometimes disclose(690,6)Môle, a peaked mountain to the
eas(219,8) lake.

While I watch(70,7)tempest, so beautiful yet(765,9), I wandered on with
a hasty step. This noble war i(484,6)sky eleva(952,8)pirits; I clasped my
hand(808,7)exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy
funeral,(21,6)thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived(168,7)
gloom a figur(515,8)stole(982,6)behind a clump of trees near me; I stood
fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A(810,6)(1024,13)
(1007,9)(488,7)object(290,6)dis(894,11) shape plainly to me; its
gigantic stature(352,6)the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I
shud(646,6)at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that
idea cross my imagination,(253,6)I became convinced(304,8)truth; my teeth
chattered(708,6)I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The(634,7)
pass(337,6)quickly(83,8)lost it(857,8)gloom. Noth(617,6)(417,6)(527,7)could
have destroy(1003,7)fair child. _He_(431,9)(312,8)!(682,12)

south. He soon reach(955,7)summi(955,10)appeared.

I remained motionless(525,6)thunder ceased(280,6)the rain still
continu(628,8)the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I
revolv(40,6)my mi(75,7)events which(937,7)until now s(452,6)to forget:

depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not
(923,7)d my brother?

No one can conceiv(226,6)anguish I suffered dur(872,8)(626,6)der(921,8)night,(489,9)spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not
feel the inconvenie(465,6)(267,6)eather; my imagination was busy in
scenes of evil(811,6)espair. I consi(258,6)the being whom(665,7)cast

to destroy all tha(562,6)dear to me.

Day dawned; and I direct(559,6)step(895,8)(203,6)town. The gates were
open(308,6)I hastened to my father’s house. My(818,7)thou(708,8)to
discover what I knew(515,8)(705,7)r(407,6)cause instant pursuit to be
made(607,8)paused when I refl(215,6)o(654,6)story(277,6)(906,7)o tell. A

midnight (602,6)the precipic(683,6)an inaccessible mountain. I
remembered also the nervous fever(661,6)(886,8)had been seized just at
the time(231,8)da(472,7)creatio(437,7)(957,6)would give an air of
delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well(450,6)that
if any(57,6)(882,6)ommunicated(809,7) rel(985,6)to me, I should have
looked upon it(856,8)ravings of insanity. Besides,(486,7)range nature
(593,7)animal(242,7)elude all(588,8), even if I were so far credited
as to persuade my(189,7)ves to commence it. And then of(731,6)use(363,6)
be(702,8)? Who could arrest a(420,6)ure capable of scali(590,6)
overhanging sid(597,6)Mont Salêve? These(762,8)ions determined me, and
I resolv(946,6)remain silent.

I(929,6)about five i(831,6)morn(805,6)en I enter(604,6)(1010,16)I
told(884,6)ervants not to disturb the family(657,7)ent int(761,6)library
to atte(337,6)ir usual hour of rising.

Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trac(283,6) I
stood(243,8)same place where(889,7)last embrac(257,12) before my
departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still(406,7)ed
to me. I gazed o(396,6)picture of my mother,(982,7)(194,6)over the
mantel-piece. (478,8)n historical subject, painted at(471,12)
desir(290,7)represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling
by the coffin of her dead(581,7). Her garb was rustic(547,6)her cheek pale;
but there(210,8)air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
sentiment of pity(419,6)w this(360,9)was a mini(929,6)of William; and my
tears flowed(804,8)looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest
(853,7): he had heard me arriv(677,7)hasten(958,6)welcome me:
“W(13,6), my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you
had come three months ago(922,6)then you would have found us all joyous and
delighted. You(86,7)o us now to share a misery(689,7)nothing can
alleviate; yet your (625,6)ce will, I hope, revive our(896,7), who seems
sinking under his misfortune(435,6)(91,6)ersuasions will induce poor
Elizabeth to cease her vain(282,6)ormenting self-accusations.—Poor
(548,7)! h(677,6)our darling and (222,6)ide!”

Tears, unrestrained, fell from my bro(914,6) eyes; a sense of mortal
(890,6)crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagin(777,7)wretchedness of(580,6)solated home; the reality came on me as a new, and
a not less terrible, disaster. I tri(700,6)calm(761,7); I enquired more
minutely concerning my(490,9)and here I named my cousin.

“She most of all(766,8)(869,6), “requires consolation; she accused
herself of hav(670,6)us(299,6) death(292,7)(404,7)(812,8)at made her
very (343,8). But since the murderer has been discovered—”

“T(37,12)(28,10)! Good God! how can(119,6)be? who could attempt
to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake(541,6)inds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he
was free last night!”

“I do not know what you mean,” repli(480,6)(363,9)in accents of
wonder, “but to us(421,6)(335,7)y we have(409,6)complete(909,6)misery. No
one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be
convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who(119,7)credit
that Justine Moritz(38,7)as so amiable(771,6)fond(741,7) the family,
(517,6)suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”

“(139,14)! Poor, poor girl, is sh(725,6)(830,7)? But it is
wrongfully; every one knows that; no one(374,8)s it, surely,(946,7)?”

“N(39,6)did(406,11)but several circumstances came out,(917,6)have
almost forced conviction upon us(486,6)her own behaviou(931,11)so
confused, as to add to(477,13) of facts a weight that, I fear,
leaves no hope for doubt. But she(599,6)be tried today(497,6)you will
then hear all.”

He then related(115,7)the morning on which(21,6)urder of(459,6)William
had(235,6)(831,8)ed,(654,9)(29,9)taken ill(646,6)confined to her
bed for(410,9)days. During this interval, one of the servants,
happening to examin(609,7)pparel sh(142,6)worn on the night(76,7)
(223,6), had(203,11) in her pocket the picture of my mother,(296,6)(269,10)judg(223,6)b(745,6)temptation(189,8)(336,6)er. T(203,10)
instantly showed it t(752,6)(245,7)others, who, without say(903,6)word to
any(294,8)(995,7) went to a magistrate; and,(719,6)their deposition,
(970,8)was apprehended. On being charged wit(550,6)fac(581,7)(1009,9)
confirmed(437,6)uspicion in a great measure by her extreme (828,6)(309,6)
manner.

This(148,6) strange tale, but it did not shake my faith(940,6)I replied
earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know(429,15)(731,7), poor,
good(20,10)is innocent.”

A(968,6) (469,7)(139,6)ther entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed
on his countenanc(234,7)he endeavour(843,6)welcome me cheerfully(483,6)
after w(916,6)exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
som(640,7) topic than(227,6)of our disast(840,8)not Ernest exclaimed,
“Good God, papa! Victor says(304,6)he knows who was(816,13) of
poor William.”

“We do also, unfortunately,”(497,8)(382,10), “for indeed I had
r(408,6)have(962,6)for ever ignorant(237,6)have discovered so much
depravity and ungratitude in one I valu(50,6)highly.”

“My dear(154,9)y(650,7)(646,10)(901,8)(604,15)“If she is, God forbid(624,6)she should suffer as guilty. She is to be
tried today,(800,7)hope, I sincerely(18,7)(90,9)will be acquitted.”(916,7)speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own min(181,6)
(857,9)and(412,8)every human be(666,6)(203,8)less of this(928,7). I
(632,6) fear, therefor(191,8)any circumstantial evidence could be
brought forward strong enough to(200,6)ct her. My tale was not one to
announce publicly; its astounding horror(874,7)be looked upon as
madness by the vulgar. Did any one(293,9)xist, except I, the
creator,(835,6)(219,7)lieve, unless his senses(410,11)him, in the
existence(359,6)e living monument of presumption and rash(819,8)ce

We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her(675,6) I last
beheld her; it had endow(44,7)with loveliness surpassing the beauty of
her childish years. Ther(483,6)the same candou(612,6)(18,6)vivacity, but
it was all(866,6) an expression more full of sensibility(766,7)tellect.
She welco(850,6)(199,6)the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear
cousin,” said she, “fills(81,9)hope. You perhaps(997,6)find some
means to justify my poor(907,11)(960,7). Alas! who is safe, if she
be(828,8)ed of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do
upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have(926,7)ly
lost that(528,6)y darling bo(445,6) this(224,7)irl, whom I(624,6)rely
love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I
never shall know joy more. But she(392,6)not, I am sure(24,13);
and then I(74,7)be happy again,(144,7)fter(702,7)d death of my little
William.”

“S(172,6)(394,7)t, m(908,11)(584,8)I, “(124,6)at(196,6)

“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes i(600,6)guilt,(303,7)at made me wretched, for I knew(542,6)(963,7)impossible: and to
see(111,16)prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me
hopeless and despairing.” (1008,6)pt.

“Dearest niece(959,8)my father, “dry(339,6)tears(615,8)

Chapter 8


We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, whe(175,6)trial was to
commence. M(275,8)(187,8) rest of the family being obliged to attend
as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of
this(583,9) mockery of(351,9)I suffered living torture. I(612,6)to

was tranquil, yet her(18,9)lity was evidently constrained; and as(470,7)nfusion had before been adduc(664,6)a proof(454,7)(813,6), she
worked up her mind to an(627,15)courage. When she ent(684,7)e
cour(503,6)threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were
seated. A tear seem(957,6)dim(84,8)(943,6)she saw us(977,6)she(95,8)

did there(608,10)looked very(402,8)ly and only returned a(915,7)ed
and unintelligible answer(348,6)(51,9)to the house about eight
o’clock(706,6)when one inqui(831,10)s(423,7)pass(913,6)(408,6)(993,6)replied t(219,7)(466,10)looking fo(698,6)(306,6)and demanded earnestly

picture was then produced(769,7)the servant had(492,6) in her pocket;
(333,9)Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, prov(316,8)it(118,8) same(755,6), an hour befo(656,7)(635,15)missed,(424,10)laced round
his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation fill(482,7)court.

Justin(273,6)called on for her defence. A(185,6)trial(557,6)roceeded, her
countenanc(1011,6)altered. Surprise,(148,7)(651,6)misery were strongly
expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears(860,6)w(559,6)e was
desir(786,6)plea(310,7)collect(933,7)power(562,6)spoke in an audible
although variable(461,6).

“God knows,”(153,6)aid, “how entirely I am innocent. But I
do not preten(844,7)my protestations should acquit me; I rest my(81,8)ce

judges to a favourable interpre(221,6) where any circumstance appears
doubtful or suspicious.”

She(937,6)relat(844,7), by the permiss(246,7)(911,11)(812,9)assed
the evening(287,8)night on(1017,11)murder(889,10)committed at the
house of(559,6)nt at Chêne, a village situa(53,7)about a league from
Geneva. On her return,(46,10)nine o’clock(1013,6)met a man who asked
her if(232,9)seen anyth(227,11)child who was lost. S(809,7)alarmed(329,6)is account an(309,8) several hours in looking for him,
when the gates of (221,6)(985,7)hut(1007,6)(926,7) forc(925,6)remain
(99,14)(410,13)in a barn belonging(613,6)cottage, being
unwill(30,7)call up the inhabitants, to whom(138,9)well known. Most
(534,13)she spent here watching; towards morning she believ(666,7)
she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her(294,10)awoke.
It was dawn(322,10)qu(653,6)her asylum, tha(175,6)might again endeavour
to find my brother. I(566,10)gone near the spot(937,7)his body lay,
i(142,6)without her knowledge. T(131,8)(824,9)bewildered when
question(623,8)e market-woman was not surprising, since(966,16)a sleepless(959,7)and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.
Conce(443,6)the pictur(104,6)could give no(783,8).

“I know,” continue(115,6)unhappy victim, “how heavily and
fatall(863,7)one circumstance weighs(433,6)st me, but I ha(130,6)power of
explaining it; an(342,6)(43,8)expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left

afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why sh(157,6)e(436,6)stolen the
jewel, to part with i(926,8)so soon?

“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for
hope(354,6)g permission to(587,6)a few witnesses examined(510,12)my
character(388,6)if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
guilt, I must be condemned, although I(466,7)pledge my salvation on my
innocence.”

Several(191,11)were called who had known her for many years, and
they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of(770,7)they
(232,8) her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come
forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
disposition(97,6)irreproachabl(365,6)uct, about to fail the accused,
when(396,11)violently agitated, she desired(589,15)address
the court.

“I am,” said she, “(31,7)sin(333,8)unhappy child who
was(924,8)d, or rather his sister, for I was educated by(427,7)ve lived
with his parents ever since and(348,6)long before his birth. It may
ther(28,6)be(873,6)d indecent in me(449,8) (449,7) o(432,7)occasion, but
when(926,7)a fellow creature(405,10)perish through(621,6)oward(1006,7)her
pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I
know(750,7) (991,9). I am(778,6)acquainted wit(142,6)(557,7). I(361,12)in the same house(49,6)her, at one ti(291,6) fiv(382,6)at anot(920,8)nearly

benevolent of human(370,9)s. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in
her(895,6)illness,(273,10)greatest affection and car(230,7)fterwards
at(440,7)her own m(254,6)d(232,7) tedious(102,10)in a manner(453,6)excited
the admiration of all who knew(377,7)fter which(308,6)gain(794,6) in my

on her perfect innocence(571,6)had no tempt(389,6)for such an action; as to

I should(895,6)willingly given it to(888,6)so much do I esteem and value
her.”

A murmur of approb(204,8)llowed Elizabeth’s simp(860,6) powerful
appeal, but it was(676,8) by her generous interference, and not in
favo(131,6)poor Justine,(300,6)om the public indign(757,6)was turned with
renewed viol(100,6)charging her(946,10)blackest ingratitud(468,6)

minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have
betraye(109,6)(764,7)t to death and ignominy? I coul(465,6)sustain the
horror of my situation(509,6)when I perceived that(492,6)opular voice and
the countenances of the judges had already condemn(236,6)unhappy victim,
I rushed out(68,8)court in agony. The tortur(104,10)accused did
not equal mine; she was(248,8)(761,6)(446,9)(794,6)the fangs of
remorse tore my boso(923,6)w(325,9)forgo their hold.

I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I w(445,6)(329,8)rt; my lips and throat were parched. I dare(745,7)sk(197,7)tal
ques(457,6)but I was know(474,7)the officer guess(582,7)cause(525,6)
visit(365,6)ballot(454,6)been thrown; they(148,6)all(951,6)(571,6)Justine
was(496,10).

I cannot pretend(687,6)scribe what I then felt. I(115,7)fore
experienced sensations of (709,6)(693,6)I have endeavoured to bestow upon
them adequate expressions(522,6)words(167,8)convey an idea(725,7)

addr(375,6)myself add(865,8)(316,7)(820,16)f(423,6)her guilt.
“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a
cas(769,7)I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our(979,8)like to
(975,7) a criminal upon circumstantial(167,10) be it ever so
decisive.”

This(938,6)trange and unexpected intelligence;(559,6)could it mean? Had
my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole worl(996,7)
believe me(576,6) if I disclo(815,8)object(816,6) suspicions? I
hasten(637,6)return home(895,6)Elizabeth eagerly deman(514,6)e result.

“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may(764,7)(304,7); all

ever again (449,8)in human goodness?(866,8),(910,7) loved and esteemed as
my sister, how(618,7)she put on those smiles of(166,10) only(566,6)tray?
Her mild(664,6)s(98,6)incapable of any severity o(994,6)(557,7)ye(362,9)
committed a murder.”

Soon after we heard(484,7)he(376,6)victim had expressed a desire to see my
(621,6). My f(556,6)wished her not to go but(385,6)that he left it to her own
judgment and feelings to(694,7). “Yes,(457,7)(536,10)
“I will go, although she is(651,7);(279,6)ou, Victor,(511,7)accompany
me; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was tortu(269,6)me, yet
I(500,7)not refuse.

We enter(940,7)gloomy prison chamber and beheld(620,8) sitting on some
straw (421,7)farther end; her hands were manacled(526,6)her head rested on
her knees. She rose on seeing us(176,6)(589,6)when we(90,6)left(283,6) with
her, she threw herself(164,9)eet of(964,13)eeping bitterly. M(580,8) wept also.

“Oh,(885,8)(956,14)Why did you rob me of my last consolation?
I relied on your(880,10)(808,6)(557,9)I(464,6)hen very wretched, I
was not so miserable as I am now.”

“And do you also believe(852,6)I am so very,(97,7)icked? D(52,10)
join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as(979,9)er?” Her
voice was suffocated(84,6)sobs.

“Rise, my(998,6)girl(850,17); “why(208,8)kneel,
if(222,6)re(326,8)t?(260,8)t one of(357,6)(187,7), I(263,8)d you

you(612,6)declar(92,6)r(1000,6). That report, you say, is false;(870,7)
assured, dear(880,8),(430,6)nothing can shake my conf(157,6) in you for a
moment, but(610,6)own confession.”

“I did(21,8)(43,6)I(36,8)ed a lie.(19,12)(137,7)I might
obtain absolution; but now(607,6)falsehood lies heavier at my heart than
all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ev(41,6)ce(801,6)
(637,7)ed,(276,8)essor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,
(475,8)almost began to think(816,8)(910,7) monster(839,6)he(680,6)I

I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked
o(909,10)wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?
In an evil hour I subscrib(73,6)a li(703,7)now only am I truly
miserable.”

She paused, weeping, and then(243,10), “I thought with horror, my
sweet(262,7)(895,9)should(981,8)(1005,6)(828,9)whom(1024,6)blessed
aunt had so highly hono(889,6)and(51,9) loved, was a creature capable
of a crime which(401,6)but the d(309,6)imself(340,7)have perpetrated.
Dear William! dearest(170,8) child! I soon shall see you again in
(801,6), where we(40,7)all be happy(417,6)t(477,6)nsoles me, going as I
am(587,6)ffer(543,14)death.”

“Oh,(344,8)! F(913,9) for having for one(718,7) distrusted you.
Why did you(935,8)? But do not mourn, dear girl. D(25,6)fear. I
will proclaim, I (17,8)(504,8)innocence.(29,8)mel(402,6)stony
hearts of(552,6)enemies by my tears(789,6)rayers. You(378,7)not die!
You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on(132,6)caffold!
No! No! I never(886,7)survive so horrible a misfortune.”

(731,7) shook her head(316,6)fully. “I(338,8)fear to die,” she said;
“that pang is past. God raises my weaknes(271,6)gives me courage to
endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world(646,6)if you remember
me(669,7)ink of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the
fate awaiting me. Learn from me(595,7)lady,(744,6)bmit in patience to
the(592,6)of (854,6)!”

During this conversation I had retir(137,6)a corner of the prison room,
(927,6)I(488,7)conceal the(489,6)d anguish(935,6)possessed me. Despair!
Who dared talk(104,6)at? The poor victim, who(627,8)morrow was to pass
the awful boundary between lif(401,6)death, felt not, as I did, such
deep(483,12)agony. I gnashed(847,6)eth(576,6)round them together,
uttering a groan(252,6)came(441,7)y inmost soul. (762,9)tarted. When
(725,6)w who it was, she approached (613,7)said, “Dear sir, you are very
kind to visit me; you, I hope,(849,8)believe(423,6)I am guilty?”

(478,8)not answer. “No,(185,8),” said Elizabeth; “he is more
convinced of your innoc(671,6)han I(221,6)for even when he heard(569,6)you
had confessed, he di(149,6)credit it.”

“I truly thank him. In these last moments I fee(685,6)sincerest
gratitude towards those who(974,13)with kindness. How sweet i(649,7)ffection of others(931,6)ch a wretch(637,6)am! It remove(308,6) than
half my misfortune, and(184,8)as if(891,9)die in peace now(881,6)my
(365,10)is acknowledged by(523,6)dear lady(95,6)your cousin.”

Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after(853,6)eelings have

heart(195,7)n(365,7)coul(48,6)ve. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered
like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief(853,8)description horrible(826,6)more, much(515,6)(I persuaded myself) was yet

when I should put them in practice(226,6)ake(202,7) use(736,7)my fellow

from thence to gather promise of new hopes,(704,7)seized by(642,9)and
the sen(52,6)guilt,(841,7)hurri(164,6)away to a hell of(377,6)se tortures
such as no language can (592,6)be.

This state(633,6)nd preyed(247,6)(551,6)lth(129,9)ad perhaps never
entirely recover(779,8)the first shock it had sustained. I shunne(241,6)fac(132,6)an; all sound of joy or complacency was(231,8) to me;
solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike (55,8).

My f(435,6)observ(787,8)pai(513,6)alteration perceptible in my disposition

awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud(622,7)brooded over me.
“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer
also? No one could love a child more than I loved your
brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but
is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain(691,6)augmenting
their unhappiness by an appearan(684,6)immoderate grief? It is also(130,7)
owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,
or eve(651,6)discharge of daily usefulness, without(949,7)no man is fit for
society.”

This advice, although good,(871,7)tally inapplicabl(884,6)y case; I
(332,7)have be(162,7)(1020,6)to hide my(290,6) and(918,7)e my friends if

shaken by(63,7)rror(736,8)recent events. Elizabe(64,7)s(175,6)
desponding; she n(751,6)er took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward(280,8)d; eternal woe(1024,6)ears she

and destroyed. Sh(1001,6)(228,11)hat happy creature who in earlier youth

future prospects. The first(737,6)ose sorrows(941,7)are sent to wean us from
the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quench(40,6) dearest
smiles.

“(1017,6) (1017,7), my dear cousin,” said she, “(260,7)miserabl(753,7) of
(740,7) Moritz, I(600,11)se(798,6)worl(819,6)its works (775,6)y before

injustice(984,8)read in books or heard from other(130,6)ales of ancient
days or imag(767,6)evils; at least(181,6)were remot(721,6)more familiar to

certainly unjust. Everybody believed(797,6)poor girl to be guilty;(352,6)f she could have committe(1000,6)crime for(713,7)she suffered, assuredly
she w(69,10)bee(601,7)ost depraved of human(938,9)s. For the sake
of a few jewels, to(150,6)mur(957,6)the son of her benefactor and friend,

it had(206,6)her own! I(302,7)not con(983,8)th(829,10) any(234,6)
being, but (434,10)I sh(370,10)thought such a(284,9) unfit(629,6)main i(940,6)society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel(416,6)(33,11); you are of(383,7)me opinion(681,6)that confirms me.
Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can

the edge of a precipice, towards(684,7)thousands are crowding and
endeavouring to plunge me in(983,7)abyss. William and Justine were
assassinated(305,8)(680,9)r escapes; h(187,6)s about the world free,

scaffold f(845,9)m(956,7)s, I(922,7)not change places with(631,7)
wretch.”

I liste(106,7)this discourse(51,6)the extremest agony. I, not in deed,
but in effect, was(531,8)(295,10). Elizabeth read my anguish in my
countenance(939,6)kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you
must calm yourself. These events(905,6)affected me, God knows how
deeply; but I am not so (310,6)ed as(850,8). There is an expression of
despair(865,6)sometim(774,6)revenge, in your (249,11)(907,6)makes me
tremble. Dear(911,9)banish these dark passions. Remember the

the power(187,6)ndering you happy? Ah! Whil(52,7)ve, w(15,8)are
true to each other, (311,6)n(627,6)land of peace and beauty,(287,6)native(543,6)ry, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our
peace?”

And c(809,9)such words from her whom I fondly prized before(116,6)
other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend(479,6)lurked(758,7)heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at
that very moment the destroyer had been(78,9)rob me of her.

Thus no(56,6)tenderness of(861,7)ship, nor the(416,7) of earth(25,6)of
heaven,(349,7)redeem my soul(349,6)woe; the(173,6)accents of love were
ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial
influence(482,7)penetrat(941,6) wounded deer dragging its fainting
limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow(146,7)had
pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.

Sometimes I(667,7)cope with the sullen despair(584,6)overwhelmed me, but
s(72,9)the whirlwind passions of(401,9)drove me to seek, by bodily
exercis(911,7)y change of place,(285,6)relief(823,6)my intolerable
sensations. It was during an acc(606,7)this ki(795,8)I suddenly left
my home(323,6)bending my steps toward(235,6)near Alpine valleys, sought
i(419,6)magnificenc(456,6) eterni(714,6)such scenes, to forget myself and
my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed
(177,12)(165,6) of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently(319,8)my
boyhood. Six years ha(484,6)ed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but n(278,6)had(471,7)d in those savag(502,6)en(433,7)(277,6).

I performed the first part(599,7)journey on horseback. I afterwards

Justine,(910,6)mis(763,6) epoch(789,6)which I dated all my woe. The
weight upon my spir(169,7)sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in
the ravine of Arv(96,6) immense mountains and precipices(884,6)overhung
me on every sid(804,7)sound(297,8)river raging among(23,6)ocks, and
the dashing(350,8)waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as
Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less
al(78,7)than(412,6)(391,6)had cre(395,6)nd rul(713,7)elements, here

augmen(368,9)endered sublime by(1022,6)(509,6)Alps, whose white and
shining pyramid(707,6)domes towered above a(395,7)belo(298,6)to another
earth(720,6)habitations of(34,8) race of(585,6)s.

I pass(545,7)bridge of Pélissier, where(791,6)avine,(1007,7)(809,9)

picturesque as(846,6)of Servox, through(865,7)I had just(316,7). The
high(111,6)now(679,11) were its immediate boundaries(149,6)I saw no
more r(787,14)and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached
the road; I hear(1021,6)rumbling thunder of the falling avalanch(656,6)mark(533,7)smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc(624,6)suprem(61,8)(1018,10)(40,12)raised itself from(59,7)rrounding _aiguilles_,
and its tremendous _dôme_ overloo(163,8)(536,6).

A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me dur(287,6)is
journey. Some turn in(772,6)oad, some new object suddenly perceived and
recognised, reminded me of days gone by(809,6)were associated with the
lighthearted gaiety of boyhoo(637,6) very winds whispered in soothing
accents(916,6)maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then ag(934,6)e
kindly influence ceased to act—I found my(478,6)et(952,6)(65,7)o grief(468,6)ndulging in all the misery of reflection(132,7)I spurred on my
animal, striving so to forget the world, my fear(246,8)ore than all,
(169,6)—or, in a(31,6)desperate fashion, I alight(468,6) threw(230,8)on
the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.

At length I arr(556,6)(182,6)village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded
to the extreme fatigue both(540,6)dy and of mind which I had endured.
For a short space of time I remain(156,10)window watch(807,6)e pallid(672,6)nings that played above(1024,11) and listening (194,7)rushing of
the Arve,(174,7)pursued its noisy way beneath(759,6)same lull(518,6)unds
acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; w(609,6)placed my head

It was(500,8)noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some
time I sat upo(912,6)rock(539,6)overlook(280,7)ea of ice. A mist covered
both(590,6)and(325,6)urrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated
the cloud(739,6)I descended(158,10)glacier. T(102,6)face is very
uneven, rising(349,6)the waves of a troubled sea,(97,8)ing low, and
interspersed by rifts(812,6)sink deep(127,6)field(276,7) is almost a
league in width, but I spent(934,8)two hours in crossing it. The
opposite(317,9) is a bare perpendicular rock. From(702,6)ide where I
now stood Montanver(566,6)exactly (103,8),(557,8)distance(301,6)(200,6);
and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess
(646,7)rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene(495,7)ea,
or rather the vast river(668,7), wound among(923,8)endent(649,10),
whose aerial summits hung over its(181,7)es. Their icy and glittering
peaks shone i(830,6)sunligh(829,6) (722,9)s. My heart, which was
before sorrowful, now swelled with someth(719,9)joy; I exclaimed,
“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander(852,6)do not rest in your narrow
beds, allow me(406,6)faint happiness, or take me, as(64,6)companion,
away f(652,8)joys of life.”

As I said(499,6)I suddenly beheld the figur(640,7)man, at som(667,10),
advancing towards me(301,7)uperhuman speed. He bounded(402,9)
crevices(436,8)ice,(561,7)(411,6)I had walk(390,8)caution; his
stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was
troubled; a mist came(638,6)my eyes(434,6)I felt a(396,6)ness seize me,
but(79,6) quickly restored by(638,6)old gale (894,7)(773,9). I
perceived, as(704,6)hape(140,6)nearer (sight trem(915,7)and abhorred!)
that it w(67,7)wretch whom(330,7)created. I tremb(733,9)rage and
horror, resolv(475,6) wait his(348,9) and then clos(500,7)him in
mortal combat. H(402,12); his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
combin(892,8)disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
rendered it almost too horrible for (674,6)eyes. But I scarcely
observe(803,6);(289,9) hatred had at first deprived me of utter(802,7)nd I recovered only to overwhelm him(819,6)words expressive of furious
detestatio(260,6)contempt.

“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dar(786,10) me? And do
not you fear(1007,7)erce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay,(891,6)I may trample you to dust! And,
oh! T(41,6)could,(1014,6)the extinction of(137,16)existence,(889,8)

“I expect(508,7) reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the

li(888,6)hings! Yet you, my(960,6)or, (529,6) and spurn me, th(34,7)ure,

you at peace; but i(79,6)refuse(55,9)glut the maw of death, until it

“Abhorred monster! Fiend(803,6)(432,8)! The tortures of hell are too
mild a(944,11)for(514,7)imes. W(649,7) devil! You reproach me with

so negligently bestowed.”

My rage wa(529,6)ou(649,7)s; I sprang on him, impelled by all the
feelings(109,7)can arm one being agains(425,6)existence of another.

He easily eluded me(827,6)aid,

“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me befo(738,7)give vent t(726,7)hatred
on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough(350,7)you seek to
increase my misery? Life, although it may(957,6)be an accumu(945,10)a(422,6), is dear to(874,17)efend it. Remember,(631,6)hast made

“Begone!(660,12)hear you. There can(471,6) community between you
and me; we are enemies. (91,6), or let us try our strength in a fight,
in(612,7)one must fall.”

was full(829,6)I did not answer him, but as I proceed(650,6)weigh(111,6)

although(839,9)(763,8) it by innumerable chinks, I found it an
agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.

“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have(106,7)a shelter,

“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpet(859,6)with clean straw, I
retired, for I sa(586,6)figure of(239,6) at a distance(731,6)I remembered

words at(275,6)irst lesson; most(571,7)m, indeed, were those(376,9)had

“As night came on,(729,7) (285,8)(753,7) retired early. When they

Safie was always gay(663,6)appy; she and I improved rapidly(94,7)

abject than(671,6)(915,7)blind mole or harmless worm. For a long(367,6)I

“Such was(136,6)istory of my beloved(569,8)rs. It impressed me deeply.

“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and

“One night during my ac(908,6)ed visit to(842,6)eighbo(40,6)wood(293,7)I
collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on
the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articl(620,6)dress and
some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with (244,6)my hovel.

solve them.

been made by a young soldier, bu(562,6)for glory and slaughter, I should
have(771,6)imbu(857,8)different sensations.

“But _Paradise Lost_ excited(52,11)and far deeper emo(65,6)(758,7)
it(528,7)had(776,6)the other volumes(894,7)had fallen into my hands, as

and encourage him, but I am solitary(206,6)bhorred.’

“These w(767,7) reflections(579,7)hour(863,6)espondenc(71,6)solitude;

postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance
attached to its success inspired me(431,6)a dread lest I(476,7) fail.
Besides, I found(1004,6)my understanding improved so much(520,6)every

until a few(983,6)(254,7)(171,7)have add(236,6)my sagacity.

“Several changes, in the meantime, took place(28,8)(823,7). The
presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also
(319,11)a greater degree of plenty reig(501,6)ere. Felix and Agatha
spent(260,6)time in amusement and conversation(128,6)were assisted in

reflec(345,6) water or my shadow(621,9)oonshine, even as(841,6)frail

“I endeavou(238,7)crush these fears(64,6)o fortify myself for the trial
which in(844,9)nths I resolv(832,6)undergo; and sometimes I allowed my
thoughts, unchecked by reason, to rambl(849,9)fields of Paradise, and

smiles of consolation. B(515,6)was all a dream; no Eve sooth(270,6)sorrows nor shared my (292,8);(626,6) alone. I remembered Adam’s
supplication to his Creator(136,6)where was mine? He had abandoned me,
and(624,8)bitterness of my heart I cursed him.

“Autumn passed thus. I saw,(353,6)surpris(960,6)grief, the leaves decay

Here I paused, not exactly knowing what(857,6)to pursue,(961,8)heard
the sound of voices(647,7)induced (253,6)conceal(566,8)und(877,8)hade

before gave (933,6)to hellish rag(949,6)gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by
pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengean(94,6)all mankind. But the
agony(393,7)(272,6)overcame me; my pulses pause(528,7)I fainted.

“For some weeks I led a(369,10) life i(690,6)woods, endeavou(833,6)o

also by the oppressive sense(1017,8)injustic(491,6)ingratitud(33,8)ir

“But my toils now drew near a close(855,6)in two months from this time I

“It was evening when I arriv(955,10)retired to a hiding-place among

“At(371,11)a sl(626,6)leep relieved me(413,8)(539,6) of reflection,
(614,6)was disturb(707,10)approach of a beautiful child, who came
running into the recess(911,6) chosen, with all(242,6)portiveness of
infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seiz(219,6)tha(261,6)

imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could(146,6) him and
educat(16,7)s my companion(574,6)riend,(647,10)not be so (995,9)in
this peopled earth.

“Urg(419,8)is impulse, I(278,8)on the boy as he pass(256,7)drew him
towards me. As soon(46,7)beheld my form, he placed his hands before
his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I(118,8)(62,6) forcibly(663,6)his
fac(865,6)said, ‘C(608,8)at is the mea(833,6)f this? I do not intend to
hurt you; listen to me.’

“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;
‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat m(182,6)tear (578,6)pieces. You
are an ogre. (104,10) or I will tell my papa.’

“‘Boy, you(32,6)never see your father again; you must come(861,6)(237,7)‘Hideous (198,9)(230,9). M(111,6) is a syndic—he is M.

“The child still(492,11)and loaded (294,8)epithets which carried

moment he lay dead at my feet.

of my malignity, it soften(582,7)attracted me. For a few (501,6)s I
(476,6)with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes(581,6)her
(159,7)lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was
for ever deprived of the(152,8)s(45,6)such beautiful(547,6)ures could
bestow an(92,7)she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in
regarding me, have chang(171,8)air of divine ben(378,6) to one

attempt to(805,9)them.

“While(475,6) overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had
committed the murder(630,6)seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I
entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A(873,6) was

her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—(910,6)(881,6)
give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my
beloved, awake!’

“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she

w(82,8) assuredly act if her darkened eyes opene(872,6)she beheld me.
The(471,8) was madness; it(226,8) the fiend within me—not I, but
she, shall suffer;(854,11) I have (882,10)because I am for ever
robbed of all that she could giv(291,6)she(106,7)atone. The crime had
its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of

Chapter 17


The(45,7)finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the
expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed(766,6)unable to
arrange my ideas sufficiently to underst(988,8)full extent of his
propo(459,8)He continued,

“Y(265,14) a female for m(458,7)whom I can liv(227,9)interchang(395,7)ose sympathies necessary(77,6)y(380,6)(392,7)(690,9)

died away while he narrat(503,7)peaceful life among the cottagers, and
as he said this I c(746,7) longer suppress the rage(132,6)burned within
me.

“I do(244,8)it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a
consent from me. You may render(266,8)most(999,10) of men, but you
(90,6)never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I(605,9)nother like

of threatening, I am content to reason(833,6)you.(33,6)malicious because I

should pity man more than he pities me? You (114,6)not call it murder if you

finish until I desolate(590,6)heart, so(388,6)you(313,7)curs(312,6)hour of
your birth.”

A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled
into contortions too horrible for(517,7)eyes to behold; but presently
he calm(123,6)self and proceeded—

“I intended to reason. This pa(531,6)is detrimental to me, for you do
not reflec(688,7)_you_ ar(606,6)(515,6)of its excess. If any being felt
emo(235,6)of benevolence(554,9)me, I should return them a hundred and a
(14,7)fold; for(836,6)one(591,6)ure’s sake(946,8) make peace(927,7)he
whole kind! But I now indulge in dream(174,6)liss(938,15) realised.
What I ask of you is(362,7)able and moderate; I demand a(175,9) of
another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratificat(446,7)small(54,6)it
is all(725,6)I can receive, and it(743,8)ontent me. It is true, we(776,7)be
monsters, cut off from(96,7)e wor(661,8)on(839,6)account(70,12) more

excit(778,6)sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my
request!”

I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences
of my(19,6)nt(586,6)I fel(954,7)there was(160,6)justice in his argument.
His ta(701,7)th(292,6)ings he now expressed proved him to be(729,11)
of fine sensations(645,6)did I no(743,7)s maker owe hi(608,10)portion
of happine(904,8)it was in my power(125,6)stow? He saw my change of
(193,7) and continued,

“I(948,6)(307,9)neither you nor any (924,6)human being(836,7)ever see
us again; I(711,6)go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not
that of man; I(559,10)stroy the lamb(405,9)kid to glut my appetite;
acorn(804,6)berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will
be(621,8)same nature as myself and(921,8) content with(51,10)fare.
We(304,7)make our bed of dried leaves;(835,6)u(124,6) shine on us as on
man(114,10)ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful
and(457,6)(650,6)you must feel(979,6)(526,6)uld(936,6)it only in the
wantonness of(635,7)and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,
I now see(372,6)ssion in your eyes; let me seize(900,6)avourable moment
and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”

“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habit(957,6) of
man, to dwell(277,6)ose(737,7)wher(172,6)beasts(575,8)fiel(555,10)your

persevere(418,6)is exile? You(556,7)etur(572,6)again seek their kindness, and

(604,8)will then(520,6)a(867,11)to ai(642,6)(604,6) task of(1009,6)uction.
This may not be; cease to argu(538,6)point, for I cannot consent.”

“How inconstant ar(389,6) feelings! But a(599,7) ag(824,6)were moved by
my re(858,7)(528,6)(835,6)why d(873,6)(351,6)harde(715,6)self to m(492,6)laints?
I swear(928,7), by the earth which I inhabit(936,6)by(736,6)hat made me, that
(422,8)(346,11)you bestow, I(631,6)quit the neighbourhood(581,7) and
dwell, as it may chance,(413,8)most savage of places. My(523,14)

away(355,6)in my dying(1019,7)s(84,9)not curse my maker.”

His words had a strange effect upon me. I(900,6)ssionated him and
sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked(90,6)him, when
I saw the filthy mass(455,7)oved and talked, my heart sicken(30,7)my
(680,8)(658,6)altered to those of horror and hatred. I tri(39,6)stifle
these sens(704,6); I thought(602,6)as I could not(421,8)ise(437,6)him, I
had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness(738,6)
was yet(477,7)power to(697,7).

“You(808,6),” I said, “to be harmless; but(622,6)you not
already shown a degree(746,6)lice(836,6)should reasonabl(571,6) me distrust
you? May not even this be a fein(308,7)will increase your triumph by
affording a wider scope for(44,6)revenge?”

“How is this? I must not be trifled with(788,6)I demand an answer. If
I(892,6)no ties and no affections,(544,7) and vice(103,6)be(389,6)rtion;
the love of another(929,6)destroy the cau(637,6)my crimes(154,8)shall

the(334,11)(141,6)sensitive being and (253,7)link(939,8)e chain of
(259,10)and events(831,6)which I am now excluded.”

I paused some time to reflect on all he had relat(486,7)the various
argument(901,7)(47,8)employed. I thought of the promi(488,6)(336,9)hich
(106,7)displayed on the open(496,7)his(494,11)(140,8)subsequent blight
of all kindly feeling b(615,6)loa(577,6)and scorn(188,8)is protectors had
manifested towards him. His power(273,7)reats were not omitted in my
calculations; a creature who could(707,6) i(241,6)ice-caves(307,8)glaciers
and hide himself(483,6)pursuit among the ridg(63,6)inaccessible precipices
was a(607,7)possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a
long(583,6) of(572,8)ion I con(620,6)(845,6)the justice due both to him and
my fellow(288,9)s demanded of m(917,9)should comply(861,6)his request.
Turning(93,7), therefore, I said,

“I consent to your(109,7), on(16,6)solemn oa(168,6)quit Europe for ever,
(879,7)ry other place(457,8)neighbourhoo(196,6)an, as soon as I shall
deliver in(141,8)hands a femal(554,6)will accompany you i(171,7)exile.”

“I swear,” he cried, “(761,7)sun, and(777,8)blue sky of
heave(31,14)fire of lov(379,7)burns my heart,(472,6)if you grant my
prayer, while they(734,7)you(239,6) never behold me again. Depar(400,9)
hom(996,6)commence(423,6)labours;(317,8) watch their progress with
unutterable anxiety; and fear not but(670,6)when you are ready(413,9)appear.”

Saying this, he suddenly qu(1008,6)me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in
my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain(737,6)greater spe(849,6)n
the flight(98,6) eagle(482,6)quickly lost among the undulations of the
sea of ice.

His tale had occupie(142,6)whole day(578,6)(591,7) was upo(751,6)verge of
the horizon(345,6)he departed. I knew(973,8)ought to hasten my(262,7)t
towards(92,6)alley,(821,8)ould(838,6)be encompassed in darkness; but my
heart was heav(194,7)my steps slow. The(602,7) of winding(314,10)
little path(315,8)(418,10)and fixing my feet firmly(996,6)advanced
perplex(553,7)(352,9)as I was(920,8)emo(419,6)whi(730,6) occurrences
(126,7)day had produced. Nigh(232,6)far(118,9)(731,6)I came to the
halfway resting-plac(876,6)seated myself beside the f(655,7)(299,6)stars
shone at intervals a(431,6)clouds (405,7)from over them;(191,7)rk pines
rose before m(705,7)every her(151,6)t(10,6) broken tree lay (634,6)
ground; i(487,6)a scene of wonderful solemnity(232,6)tirred strange
thoughts within me. I wept bitterl(762,7)clasp(490,7)hands in agony, I
exclaimed, “Oh!(296,6)(56,7)oud(11,6)winds, ye are all about to mock
me; if ye really pity me, crush sensatio(633,6)memory; let me become as
nought(774,6)if not,(902,7)(8,8)(972,6)leave me(828,12).”

These were wild(822,6)iserable (305,8), but I cannot describe to you
how(724,6)ternal twinkling(837,8)(290,6)weighed upon m(651,6)how I
listened to(533,7)blast(934,8) as if it(169,6)a dull ugly siroc on its
way to consume me.

Morning dawned(642,8)I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no
rest(262,6)returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could
give no expression to my(495,10)s—they(300,9)(298,6)with a
m(927,7)’(332,7)t(823,8)ir excess destroyed my(690,6) beneath them.
Thus I(198,10)ho(910,9)ntering the house, presented myself to the
family. My haggar(570,6)(579,6)ppearance awoke intense alarm(587,7)
answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt(518,7)I(686,6)placed
under a ban—(32,8)had no right to claim(295,7)sympathies(47,6)
never more might I enjoy companionship(386,6)them. Yet even thus I
loved them to adoration;(413,6)o save them, I resolv(746,6)dedicate
(348,10)my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation
made(828,7)other circumstance of existence pass(777,8)me like a dream,
(594,6)at(1020,8) only had to me the reality of life.

Day after day, week(16,7)week, passed away on my(855,7)(841,10); and

venge(262,8)the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my
repugnance(771,7) task which was enjoined me. I fou(329,8)(196,11)
compose a femal(986,6)out again devoting several months to profound
study and laborious disquisition.(770,7)heard of some discoveries
having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of(242,10)
material(696,7)success, and I sometimes(585,10)f obtaining my
father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to
(752,6)pre(729,6)of dela(286,6)shrank from taking the first step in an
under(33,7)whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to
me. A change indeed(822,6)aken place in me; my health,(576,7)had
hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. M(404,8) saw(377,6)(208,7)with pleasure(482,6)he turned hi(484,9)s
towards the best method of eradicat(394,8)remains(163,7)melancholy,
(854,6)(477,6)now and then would return by fit(625,7)with a devouring
blackness(967,6)ast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took
refuge in(339,6)ost perfect solitude. I passed whole days o(50,6)lake
alone in a little boat, wat(136,6)the clouds(983,6)istening to the
rippling of the waves, silent(51,9)less. Bu(232,6)fresh air and
bright sun seldom failed to(601,8) me to some degree of compo(501,9)
on my(384,8)I me(341,6)salutatio(462,9)friends(407,8)readier smile
and a more cheerful heart.

It was after(108,11)from one(259,7)se rambles that my (698,6),
calling me aside, thus addressed me,

“I am (789,6)to remark, my dear son,(90,6)you have resumed your former
(786,8)(440,6)seem to be(674,7)(451,7)yourself. And ye(85,6)are still
(925,8)and(18,6) avoid our society. For(412,6)time I was lost in
conjecture as(565,7) caus(303,7)is, but yesterday an idea struck me,
and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a
point(936,7)be not only useles(137,7)draw down treble misery on us all.”

I trembled violently at his exordium(1020,6)(510,9) continued—

“I confess, my(467,11)I(465,6)always looked forward(432,8)
marriage(706,6)our(537,6)Elizabeth as the tie of(33,6)omestic comfor(922,6)the
stay(792,7)declining years. You were attach(915,6)each other(761,6)your
earliest infancy; you studied together(274,6)appeared, in disposi(927,6)and
tastes, entirely suit(122,6)one another. But so blind i(240,6)experience of
man(897,6)w(345,6)conceiv(198,6)be the best assistants to my plan may have
(138,9)destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as(904,6)sister, without any
wish(956,6)she might become(956,6)wife. Nay, you(132,9) met(493,6)(256,7)
wh(379,6) may love; and considering(987,9) as bound in honour to
(558,9), this struggle may occasion the poignant(778,8)which you(459,7)
to feel.”

“My(653,6)(757,6), reass(927,7)rself. I love my cousin tenderly and
sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as(759,11)does, my
warmest admiration(634,6)ffection. My future hopes and prospects ar(503,11)(316,6)up i(271,6)expect(86,6)(862,7)union.”

“T(647,6)ress(32,7)(524,6)entiments of(368,7)ubject,(890,6)ar Victor,
gives me more pleasure than I(527,6)for some tim(759,12)d. If you
feel thus, we shall (393,6)dly be happy, however present events may cast
a gloom over us(888,6)it(882,6)is(30,7)(530,6)(985,6)s to(693,6)taken so
strong a hold(276,9)mind(929,6)I (792,6)o dissipate. Tell me,
therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnis(416,9)the
marriage. We(849,6)been unfortunate, and rec(261,11)have drawn us
from(955,6)everyday tranquillity befitting my year(597,6)infirmities. You
a(780,6)nger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as(872,6)re of a competent
(186,6)e,(322,6)an early (234,8) would at all interfere with an(766,8)
plans of honour and utility(412,6)you may(632,9)med. D(177,14)

your part(187,7)cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words
with cand(203,8)answer me, I conju(382,6),(265,6)confidence and
sincerity.”

I listened to my father in sil(52,8) remained(916,15)incapable
of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my(791,6)a multitude of
thought(594,6)endeavour(154,6)arrive at(126,6)conclusion. Alas! To me
the idea of(817,14)union(536,6)my Elizabeth was one(540,6)rror and
dismay. I was bound by a(888,7) promise which I had not yet fulfilled
and dare(28,6)break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not
impend over(549,6)d my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival(559,6)this deadly weigh(173,6)hanging rou(91,6)neck and bowing me to the
ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster de(752,6)ith
his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a(450,7)from
(375,8)expected peace.

I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
England or(340,6)ing(343,8)long correspon(854,6)(354,7)ose philosophers
of(1024,6)country whose knowledg(858,6)discov(504,6)were of indispensable
use to me(827,7)present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining
(334,6)sired intellig(187,6)as dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I
had an insurmountable aversion(552,7)(895,9)engaging(474,8)in my
loathsome task(210,7)father’s hou(854,6)le in habits of(746,6)iar
intercours(375,13)I loved. I knew(375,6)a thousand fearful
accident(868,8)occur, the slightest of(985,7)woul(418,6)lose a tale to
thrill all conn(645,6)with m(526,7)horror. I was aware(657,8)at I
should often (94,6)ll self-command,(95,6)apacity of hiding the
harr(929,6)sensations(620,6)(180,6)possess me dur(54,7) progress of my
unearthly occupation.(992,8)absent(919,8)from all(361,8)(420,7)thus
employed. Once commenced, i(143,8)quickly be achieved, and I(392,7)be
restored to(532,6)mily in(989,6) and happiness. My promise fulfilled,
the monster(445,8)epart for ever. Or (s(98,6)ond fancy imaged) some(548,9)(547,7)mean(658,6)occur to destroy him and put an en(189,7)
slavery(119,10)

These feelings dictated my answer(248,9)ther. I expressed a wish to
visit England, but conceal(484,8)true reasons of this request, I
cloth(120,6)desires under a gui(894,6)ch excited no suspicion,(922,7)I
urg(67,12)(906,6)an earnestnes(654,7)eas(454,6)duc(237,6)(1004,6) to
comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that
resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find
(909,6) was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,
and he hoped(991,6)change of scen(700,6)varied amusemen(937,7), before my
return, have (782,9)me entirely(794,6)self(592,6) duration(976,6)(947,6)c(231,6)left(842,7)own choice; a few months, or
at most a year, was the(389,8)contemplat(992,6)e paternal kind
precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without
previously communicating(595,6)me,(88,7), in(747,6)rt(623,6)Elizabeth,
arrang(382,8)Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. Thi(555,6)rfered
with the solitude I coveted for(277,6)rosec(239,6)(371,6)task; yet at the
commenc(483,6)(407,6)(553,7)(66,7)e(420,6)(434,6)friend could in no way be
an impediment, and truly I rejoic(620,8)thus I(237,8)be saved many
hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between
m(705,6)the intrus(626,10)foe. If I were alone,(730,6) he no(280,6)imes
force his abhorred(270,11)n me to remind m(289,8)task or to
(651,11) its progress?

To England, therefore,(985,7)bound(322,6)it was understoo(943,7)my union(516,6)(600,9)(577,8)take place immediately on my (949,6). My father’s
age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For(980,7)(187,7) was one
reward I promised(1020,7) from my detested toils—one consolation for my
unparalleled sufferings;(269,8)(728,8)pect of(835,6)day when,
enfranchised(122,9)miserable slavery, I(571,7)claim(324,11)and
forget(834,6)ast in(371,9)(999,6)her.

I now made (977,7)ments(201,7)(839,8), but one feeling haunted me
which filled me(94,6)fear and agita(755,6)During my ab(913,6)(835,8)

unprotect(306,8)his attacks, exasperated as he(884,7)be by my
departure. But he had(517,10)to follow me wherever(383,9)go, and
(899,14)ccompany(869,7)(812,7)? This imagin(564,6)was dreadful in
it(666,6)but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety(957,7)(321,7).
(905,6)agonised(500,6)the idea(339,8)possibility(918,6)the re(816,6)of

mach(442,7)s.

I(977,6)in the latter end of September(992,6)I again quitted my native
country. M(882,9) had been my own suggestion, and(1006,10)
therefore acquiesced(574,7)he was(924,8)with disquiet (494,7)(527,7)

been her care(519,7)provided me a (789,6)ion in Clerval—and yet a man
is blind to a thousand minute circumstances(618,7)call forth a woman’s
sedulous attention. She long(979,6)bid me hast(360,6)return;(118,11)
conflicting emo(610,6)rendered her mute as she bade(232,6)tearful, silent
farewell.

I threw(759,8)into the carriage(906,6)was to convey me away, hardly
know(874,7)ther(876,7)go(445,6)nd careless of w(80,8)passing around.
I remembered only(603,6)i(724,6)with a bitter anguish(715,8)reflected on
it, to ord(748,8)my chemical instruments should be pack(391,6)go with
me. F(682,12)reary imag(881,8), I passed through many beautiful
and majestic scenes(780,6)my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could
only think of the bourne of my travels and the work(749,7)(438,7)occupy
me whilst they endured.

After some days spent in listless indolence, dur(491,7)ch I(126,6)rsed
many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two(117,6)for

was alive to every new(379,6), joyful when he saw(335,6)eauties(351,7)
setting sun(703,6)more happy(60,9)beheld it rise and recommence a new
day. He pointed out to me the shifting colour(126,8) landscape and
the appearanc(163,9) sky. “This is(851,6)it is to live,” he cried;
“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein(426,7)fore are
you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth,(1021,7)occupied by gloomy
thought(682,6)neither(388,9)descent(738,8)evening star nor the golden

miserable wretch, haunt(317,6)a curse that shut up(730,7)avenue to
enjoyment.

We had agreed to(347,7)(193,6)Rhine in a boat from(927,11) to
Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this
voyage we passed many willowy island(517,6)saw several(901,7)ful towns.
We stayed a day at Mannheim(918,6)o(502,6)fifth(201,6)our departure from

becomes much more picturesque(67,6)river(360,8)s rapidly and winds
between hills, not high, but steep(211,7)f(264,11)forms. We saw
many ruined castles sta(910,6)(267,7)edges of precipices, surrounded by
black woods, high and inaccessible. This par(910,9)Rhine, indeed,
presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view
rugged(270,8)(213,15)overlooking tremendous(211,13)with
the dark(724,7)rushing beneath;(547,12)sudden turn of a promontory,

as we glided dow(235,7)tream. Even I, depressed in mind(828,6)my spirits
continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I l(923,6)the
bottom(842,8)boat(937,6)as I gaze(948,9)cloudless blue sky, I seemed to
drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these
were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had
been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tas(344,6)
man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful(573,6)s
of my own country; (69,7)visite(556,6)lakes of Lucern(587,6)Uri, where the

Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and
to dwell(479,7) prai(1012,6)(541,6)you(912,6)o eminently deserving. He was a
being forme(392,9)“very poetry of nature.” His wild and
enthusiastic imagination was chastened b(437,7)ensibility of his heart. His
soul overflowed(413,6)ardent affection(1019,7)his(312,7)ship wa(860,7)at
devoted and wondrous(190,7)(875,6)the worldly-minded teach us to look for only
(959,7)(219,11). But even human sympathies were not sufficient to
satisfy his eager mind. The scene(355,6)external(364,7),(996,8)thers regard
onl(696,7)admiration, h(935,6)(309,10)our:—

    ——The sounding cataract

And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely (899,6)lost
for ever? Ha(48,7)mind, so replete(796,6)ideas,(887,12)s fanciful

life of its creator;—h(152,12) perished? Does it now only(247,6)

beaming(763,6)beauty, has decayed, but(73,6)spirit still visits and
consoles(111,6)unhappy friend.

Pardon(417,7)ush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight
tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry(175,6)they soothe my heart,
overflow(239,9)the anguish(455,7)his remembrance(411,6)es. I will
proceed(552,6)my tale.

Beyond Cologne we desc(497,6)(178,7)plains of Holland; and we resolved to
post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of
the river was too(798,8)to aid us.

Our journey here l(129,8)(962,8) arising(955,6)beautiful scene(368,8)we
arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we (328,7)ed by sea to England.
It was on a clear morning, in the latter(99,6)of December, that I first saw
the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new(236,6);
they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was mark(232,6)the
(605,12)of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and(656,7)ere(482,6)Spanish
Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich(143,6)Greenwich—places(739,7)I had heard
of even in my country.

it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had

But in Clerval(233,7)the image(970,7)former self; he(518,6)nquisitive
and anxious to gain experienc(268,6)instr(983,6). The differen(498,6)manners(660,7)he observed was to him(384,6)exhaustible sour(562,6)(95,11) and amusement. H(176,6)also pursuing an o(777,6)he had long

to quiver(869,6)my heart to palpitate.

After passing some months in London, we received a letter(599,6)a person in
Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the
beauties(876,8)native country and asked us if those were not sufficient
allure(880,6)to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,
where he resided. Clerval eagerly desir(734,9)ept this invit(614,11)I,
al(523,6) I abhorred society, wish(1007,6)view again mountains and streams and
all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.

We had arrived in England a(848,6)beginning of Octob(602,8)(705,7)now
February. We accordingly determin(755,6)commence(382,13)towards the
(387,7)(970,6)expiration of another(677,6). In(364,6)expedition we did not
intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but(381,6)sit Windsor, Oxford,
Matlock(918,6)the Cumberland lakes, resolving to(331,7)(319,8)comple(197,7)
this tour abou(231,7)nd of July. I packed up my chemical instru(723,6)and
the materials I had collected(145,15)finish my labours in some
obscure nook in the(774,6)ern highlands of (995,8)(562,6)quitted London o(58,6)27th of March and remained a few days at
(355,9)rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us
(801,8)eers; (273,6)jestic oaks, the quantity of game(454,10)herds of
stately deer were all novelties(110,6).

From thence we proceed(1022,6)(556,6). As we entered(673,6)city, our minds
were filled(947,6)the remembrance of(766,6)vents that had been transacted
there more than a century and a half before. I(939,6)he(46,6)t Charles

after the whole n(949,6)had forsaken his cause to jo(621,7)standard of
Parliament and liberty. The memory(283,6)at unfortunate king and his
companion(511,7)amiable Falkland(533,6)insolent Goring, his queen, and
son, gave a peculiar interest to every part(430,8)city which they
might be suppos(550,6)have inhabited(218,6)spirit of elder(804,6)found a

feelings had not(90,8)n imaginary gratification(311,7)ppea(654,8)
(224,9)had yet(942,7)elf sufficient(956,6)y to obtain our admiration.
The(616,6)ges are an(58,6)and picturesque(972,6)street(41,7)lmost

I enjoyed this scen(522,7)yet my(31,6)men(994,6)embittered both by the
(832,12)e pas(868,6)the anticip(947,6)(718,7)future. I was formed
for peaceful happiness. During my youthful(709,6)discontent never
visited my mind(720,6)if(102,7)ever overcome by _ennui_(969,6)sight of what

pitiable to others(421,6)ntol(66,7)to myself.

We passed a consid(103,7)period at Oxford, rambling(740,7)its environs
and endeavo(588,6)to identify every spot(991,7)might relate to the most
animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of(683,6)very

From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in
Cumb(551,6) and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the
Swiss(490,10)(295,7)(436,6)patches of snow(796,7)yet lingere(559,8)
northern sid(49,6)the(576,10)(740,6)lakes(687,10)dashing(45,7)

imagined himself to have possessed while he(666,11)(717,6)his
inferiors. “(592,8)pass my life here,” said he(401,6); “and(608,6)
thes(518,11) I should scarcely regret Switz(716,11)the Rhine.”

But(283,9)(864,6)a traveller’s(140,6)is one(895,6)includes much pain
amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever(728,7) stretch; and
when he begins to sink into repose, he finds(373,9)oblig(621,6)quit

We ha(396,11)visite(924,6)various(947,6) of Cumb(417,11)Westmorland
and conceived an affection(202,9)(996,7) inhabitants whe(789,6)period
of our appointment(651,6)our Scotch friend approached(246,7)e left them
to(541,7) on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my

dis(200,11). He might remain in(755,17)wreak his vengeance
on my relatives. This idea pursued me(817,6)orment(17,7)t every moment
from(624,7)I(136,7)otherwise have snatched(711,7) and peace. I waited
f(331,6)letters(412,6)feverish impatience; if they were delayed(377,6)

W(775,7)se(106,8)s possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a(483,7),
but (147,9)him as his shadow, to protect him from(205,6)ancied rage of
his destroyer. I felt as if(812,7)committed(986,6)great crime, the
consciou(250,6)of(634,7)hau(672,7)(596,6)s guiltless, but(906,7)indeed
drawn down a horrible curse up(792,6)head, as mortal as(420,6)of(143,6).

I visited Edinburgh(697,6)languid eyes(447,7)nd(628,6)ye(492,7)city(951,6)

impatient to arrive (957,7)termination of my journey.

We left(556,11)in a week, pas(381,6)hrough Coupar(242,6)Andrew’s, and
along(409,6)anks(468,8)Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us(475,6)(806,6)in no mood to laugh(338,6)alk(716,6)strangers or enter into
their feelings or plans(769,6)the good humour(126,10)from a guest;(208,6)ccordingly I told(740,9)that I wished to make(360,6)our of Scotl(278,8)e. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself(560,6)let this be our
rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not(947,6)fere with
my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peac(782,6)solitude for a short
time; and when I return, I hope it will b(118,6) a lighter heart, more
congenial to your own temper.”

Henry(346,11)dissuade me, but seeing me bent on(305,6)plan, ceased to
remonstrate. He(246,8)ed(237,7)write often. “I had rather(193,8)

your(567,6)ce.”

Having par(763,9)my(125,9)I determin(733,6)visit some remote spot of
(742,8) and finish my work in(583,9). I did (145,6)ubt but(837,6)the
monster follow(418,6)and would discover himself to me(644,8)should have
(129,6)ed,(928,6)he might receive his companion.

W(433,6)is resolution I traversed the northern highlands(237,7)xed on one of
th(285,8)st of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place
fitted for such a work, being hardly more(627,6)a rock whose high sides we(874,6)tinually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely
afford(556,6)sture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its
inhabitants(667,8)consisted of five persons,(200,7)gaunt and scraggy limbs
gave tokens(354,7)ir(133,11)fare. Vegetable(423,6)bread,(557,6)they
indulged in(354,6)luxurie(192,7)even fresh water, was to be procur(816,7)
the mainland(886,8)was about(216,6)miles distant.

On(377,6)hole island there were(788,7)ree(346,11)hut(346,8)(616,9)se was vacant(776,8)arrived. This I hired. It contained(885,6)wo

furniture(209,7)ook possession, an incident(422,8)ould doubtless have
occasioned some surprise had not(282,10)ense(277,9)cottagers been
benumbed by wa(710,8)(332,6) poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at
and unmolested,(1013,8)thanked for the pittance of food and clothes
(874,6)I gave, so much does suffering blunt(754,6)(203,6)arsest sensations
of men.

In this retreat I devoted(539,7)rning to labour; but i(752,6)evening,
(902,8) weather permitted, I walked o(805,6)stony beach(641,8)sea to
listen to(609,7)ves as they roare(267,6)dashed at my feet. It(930,6)
monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I th(615,6)of Switzerland;(444,7)
far different from(291,6)desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills

as I proceeded in my(651,7), it became every day more horrible and
irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my
laboratory for several day(467,7)at other (90,8)toiled day and night
in order to complete my work(709,8), indeed, a filthy(255,6)ss in(1023,9)was engaged. During my(321,7)experiment, a kind of
enthusiastic frenzy had blinded (290,6)th(318,6)or of my employment; my
mind was intently fix(989,10)consummation(65,7)(429,8)and my eyes
were shut(115,21)(495,7)ings. But now I went to it in
cold blood(91,9)heart often sickened at(763,6)ork(210,7)hands.

Thus situated,(233,7)(612,6)the most detestable(688,11), immersed in
a solitude where nothing(605,7)for an instant call my attention from
the actual scene in (492,19), my spirits(763,8)unequal; I
grew restless(632,6)ervous. Every moment I fe(969,8)meet my
persecutor(803,14)sat with(444,8)(496,14)ground, fearing
to raise them lest they should encounter the object(232,9)so much

I(516,7)ean time I worked on(715,9)(730,6) was already considerably
advanced. I looked towards it(112,6)letion(353,6)a tremulou(444,6)eager
hope,(524,9)dared not trust myself to question bu(339,8)was
intermixed(454,6)obscure forebodings of evil that made(845,10)(839,6)

Chapter 20


(549,6)one evening (48,6)laboratory;(426,6)un had set(948,6)(871,6)on was just
rising(477,11)ea; I ha(245,6)sufficient light for my(956,7)men(89,7)I

(609,8) the effects(194,6)at I was now doing. Three years before,(37,6)
engaged i(968,6)same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled
barbarity had desolated(576,10)and filled i(430,6)ever(752,6)the bitterest
remorse.(197,11)about to form another being(437,6)ose dispositions(220,7)alike ignorant; she might be(1015,6)en thousand times more malignant than her
mate and delight, for its own sak(605,6)murd(315,7)wretchedness. He had
sworn(935,6)it(586,6)eighbourhood of man(379,6)ide himself in deserts, but she
(781,7); and she, who in all probability was to(245,8)a thinking and
reason(14,6)imal,(291,7)refuse to comply(428,6)a compact made(588,7) her
creation. They(360,7)even hate each other; the(597,6)ure who already lived
loathed hi(349,6)deformity(980,6)(450,6)he not conceive a greater abhorrence

and he be again alone, exasperated by(148,6)resh provocation of(759,6)
(525,6)(43,6)one of(303,9)species.

Even if they were to leave Europ(721,6)inhab(653,7)(612,7) of(668,7)w world,
yet(105,8)the first resul(47,8)ose sympathies for whic(992,6)dæmon

the earth wh(423,8)make the very existen(79,6)the(280,8)(867,9)
condition precarious and full of terror. Had I r(1015,10)my own benefit,
to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had(833,8)been moved
(508,7)sophism(395,9)being(53,7)created;(68,9)en struck senseless by
his fiendish threats; but now(202,6)(460,10)time, the wickednes(300,6)y
promise burst(215,6)me; I shuddered(776,6)ink that future ages(943,7)(274,6)me
as their pest, w(567,6)elfishness had not hesitat(92,6)buy it(736,6)peace at
the price, perhaps,(697,8)(509,17)whole human race.

I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by
the light(822,8)moon(757,10) a(859,6)casement. A ghastly grin
wrinkled his lips as he gazed o(131,9)re I sat fulfilling the task
(874,6)he had allot(314,7)me. Yes,(28,8)followed me in my travels; he
had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progres(892,6)claim the
(231,6)ment(647,6) (647,7).

As I look(289,6)him, his countenance expressed the utmost ext(80,6)
malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of ma(790,7)n(790,12)of(913,6)ing another like to(154,6)(100,7)mbling(89,6)passion,
tore to pieces(464,6)hing on (468,6)I was engaged. The wretch saw me
destroy(613,6)reature(63,6)ose(907,8)(785,10)he depended for
happiness(169,6)(248,7)howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.

I lef(746,6)roo(246,7)lock(679,8)door, made a solemn vow(645,7)own
(895,6)never to resume my labour(581,7)then(122,6)(341,11)steps, I
s(446,6)(82,6) apart(885,6)(327,6)alone; none were near (655,6)dissipate
the gloom(238,7)lieve me from the sickening oppress(546,7)(1023,6)st
terrible reveries.

Several hours passed(542,6)I remained(145,7)y window gaz(526,7)the sea;
it(203,7)most motionless, for the winds(224,6)hush(102,8)all nature
reposed unde(52,6)eye(193,8)quiet moon. A few fishing vessel(327,7)
speck(864,7)water(747,6)now(425,9) the gentle breeze waft(917,7)sound
of voices a(769,6)fishermen called to one(861,8). I fel(620,6)silence,
al(954,6)(816,7)hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear
was suddenly arrested b(863,6)paddling of oars(575,6)the shore(359,7)
person landed close to my house.

In a few minutes after, I hear(339,6)creak(109,7)my(832,7)as if some one
endeavour(294,7)pen it softly. I(803,7)ed(699,6)head to foot;(327,8)a

dwelt in a cottage not far(825,6)mine; but(909,7)overcome(350,8)sensation
of helplessness, so often(505,6)in frightful dreams, when you in vain(284,10) to fly(958,6)an impending dang(695,8)was root(624,6)the spot.

P(286,6)ly(414,13)sound of footstep(790,6)g(552,7)ssage; the door
open(1006,8)the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutti(79,7)(507,6)he
approached me and said(371,6)smothered(846,6),

“You have destroy(940,8)ork which you began; what is it that you
intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I(106,6)end(653,7)il and misery;

“Begone! I d(370,8)my(368,8); never will(318,6)ate another like
yourself, equal in deformity(983,7)ckedness.”

“Slave, I before reasone(423,10), but y(596,8)proved (103,8)

obey!”

“The hour(218,7)irresolution is past(985,10)period of(800,7)ower is
arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of(419,11); but

the wil(361,6)of a snake,(120,6)(196,6)sting with its venom. Man, you(182,6)
repent of(383,7)juries you inflict.”

“Devil, cease; and do not pois(553,7)air(110,6)these sounds of malice.

“It is well. I go;(542,7)member, I(440,7)be(292,6)you(427,9)wedding-night.”

I started forwar(816,6)exclaimed, “Villain! B(446,6)you sign my
death-warrant, be sure(548,6)you a(800,6)rself safe(115,6)would(308,6)seized him(980,6)he eluded me and quitted the hous(213,6)

across the waters(594,6)an arrowy swiftn(703,8)was soon lost amidst the
waves.

All was again silent(212,7)is(474,6) rang in my ears. I burned(718,6)rage to
pursu(883,6)murderer of my peac(280,6)(257,10)e(231,7)to the ocean. I
walked up(727,7)wn my room hastily(73,6)erturbed, while my imagination
conjur(73,7) thousand images to torment and(923,7)me. Why had I not
follow(489,6) and clos(247,8)(422,7)mortal strife? But I had suffer(550,6)
to depart(849,6)he had directed his course toward(482,6)mainland. I shuddered
to think who might b(375,6)next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.
And then I thought(521,7)of(512,10)—“_I wi(924,17)
your (924,14)_” That, then, wa(683,6)period fix(947,6) the
fulfilment(551,7)destiny. In(909,6)hour I should di(860,6)at once satisfy and
extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I
(262,8)(696,6)beloved Elizabeth, of her tear(866,6)endless sorrow,(73,6)she
(182,7)find her lover so barbarously snatched from her,(91,6), the first I
had sh(315,7)many months, stream(64,8)my eyes(612,6)I resolve(246,6)to fall
before my enemy without a bitter struggle.

The night passed away(706,6)the sun rose(189,6)(966,9); my feelings became
calmer, if it may be called calmness(389,6)the violence of rage sinks into
the depths of despair. I left the house(322,6)horrid scene of the last
night’s contention(922,6)walked o(136,6)beach(56,8)sea, which I
almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between m(702,6)my fellow
creatures; nay, a wish(762,6)such(760,8)prov(992,6)fact stole across me. I
desired(821,6)I m(435,9) my life(208,6)at barren rock, wearily, it is true,
but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it(1014,6)o
be sacrificed or to see those whom I most (870,6)die under the grasp of a
dæmon(49,8)had myself created.

I(440,8)abou(517,6)isle like a rest(933,6)pectre, separat(889,8)all it
(1006,6)and(221,6)able i(658,6)(49,7)ion. When it(731,7) no(573,8)the

sleep.(240,7)been awak(519,6)whol(718,9)preceding(938,6), my nerves
were agitated(951,6)my eyes inflam(477,6)watching(249,10)y. The sleep
into(759,8) now sank refreshed me;(826,6)hen I awoke, I again felt as
if I belonged to a ra(993,6)human beings(434,6)(480,6)(913,6)I began to
reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the
words(977,8)fiend rang in my ear(130,7)a death-knell; they appeared
(34,8)ream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.

The sun had far descend(413,8)I(169,7)sat(555,8)shore, satisfying my
appetite,(407,7)(547,6)come ravenous,(272,6)an oaten cake,(419,8)saw a
fishing-boat land close to me(720,6)on(615,9)men brought me a packet;
it contained letters(853,6)Geneva(74,10)from Clerval entreating me to
join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where
(47,6),(60,6)(142,13)the friends he(387,6)ormed in London desired
his return to complet(892,6)negotiati(972,6)y had entered into for his
Indian(28,6)prise. He could not any longer del(215,7)departure; but as
his journey to(170,8)might be followed, even sooner than he now
conjectured, b(318,6)(120,7)voyage, he(400,8)ed(399,6) bestow as much of
my society on him as I(209,7)spar(225,6)bes(550,8), therefore, to
leave my solitary isle and(629,6)et(87,6)t Perth(454,7)we(238,7)proceed
southwards together. This(639,7) in a degree recall(215,9)lif(732,6)
I determined to quit my island at the expir(494,6)of two days.

Yet, before I(439,7)ed(242,7) was a task to perform, on(946,7)I shuddered
to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments(925,6)for(803,6)purpose I

morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courag(528,6)unlocked the door

destroyed, lay scat(957,6)(977,6) floor(267,8)almost felt as if(69,7)mangl(158,7)living flesh of a human being. I paus(612,6)collect myself and

meantime I sat up(502,7)beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my
(916,9)apparatus.

Nothing could be more complete tha(893,6)alteration(958,6)had taken place

conclusion.

Between two(471,7)ree(895,7) morn(978,7) moon rose(929,6)I then, putt(872,7)basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles(612,6)the shore.
The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were retu(173,7)owards land,
(746,6)(125,7)away(109,9)m. I(767,12)I was(156,7)the commission of a
dreadful crime and avoided(933,6)shuddering anxiety any encounter(971,6)my
fellow(573,6)ures. At one(830,6)(364,8), which (911,6)fore(918,6)clear, was
suddenly overspread by a thick cloud(568,7) took advantage(635,8)moment of
darknes(988,6)cast my (466,7)into(415,6)ea; I listened (23,7)gurgling sound
as it sank(594,7)en(385,21) spot. The sky became(182,6)ed, but
the air(519,6)ure, al(1000,6) chilled by the northeast breeze(1007,6)was then
rising. But it refreshed (458,7)f(77,6)me(460,7)uch agreeable sensations
that I resolv(259,6)prolong my stay o(829,6)water(951,6)fix(839,8)rudder in a
direct position, stretched myself a(651,6)bottom(437,8)boat. Clouds hid the
(563,6)everything was obsc(310,6)nd I heard onl(307,6)sound(85,12) as its
keel cut through(207,7)ves;(671,6)urmur lu(308,7)(612,6)in a short(713,6)I
slept(533,6)ly.

I do not know how long I remained in this situa(276,6)but when I awoke I
found(481,6)the sun had already mounted considerably(615,6)wind was high, and
(219,9) continually threa(740,7)he safety of my little skiff. I found(536,6)t(100,12)(658,10)and must have driven me far(781,10)coast from
(1017,6)I had embarked. I endeavour(891,6)change my course but quickly(150,12)if I again made the attemp(606,8)at would be instantly(788,8)with
water. Thu(413,8)ed, my(590,6)resource(880,6)o(227,6) befor(111,6)wind. I
confess(925,6)I felt a few(867,11) of terror.(260,7)no compass(926,6)me
a(457,7)so slenderly acquaint(181,7) the geography(830,6)is part(843,7)
worl(586,15)was of(486,8)benefit to me. I might b(455,9)into(75,6)ide Atlantic(1014,6)eel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in
the immeasurable water(311,7)roared and buffeted around(163,7)(780,11)
been out many hours(156,7)l(829,6)torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to
my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, (708,6)were covered by clouds(813,6)flew(548,16),(592,6)to be replac(57,6)others;(112,10)up(114,6)
sea; it(635,8)be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your
task is(298,8) ful(753,6)!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and
of Clerval—all left beh(203,7) wh(990,7)monster(575,7)satisfy his
sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me(633,6)a reverie so
despairing(639,6)rightful(878,6)even now, whe(429,6)scene is(445,8)point of
closing(962,8)me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.

Some(614,7)passed thus; but by degrees, as(880,9)declined towards the
horizon,(537,9) died away(249,8)gentle breeze and(962,6)ea became
free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I(800,6)sick
and hardly able to hol(110,6)rudder(338,7)suddenly I saw a line of high
lan(227,13) south.

Almost spent, as I was, by fatigu(221,10)dreadful suspense I endured
for several(999,6), this(150,7) certainty of life rushed like a flood of
warm joy to my heart,(351,6)ears g(55,6)from my eyes.

How mutable are our feelings(62,6)how strange is(659,6)clinging love we have
(161,8)even i(682,6)excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a
part(946,7)dress and eagerly steered my course(412,13)land. It had a
wild and rocky appearance, but(436,6)approached nearer I easily perceived
the traces of cultivation.(565,7)vessels near(931,6)hor(734,6)found myself
(620,9)transported back to the neighbourh(472,6) civilised man. I
careful(68,6)ce(831,6)windings of(265,9)(447,6)ailed a steeple which I at
length saw issuing(887,7)ehind a small promontory. A(743,7) in a state of
extreme debility, I resolved to(479,6)directly(846,13)town, as a(981,6)
where I could most(399,9)rocure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with
me(178,7)turn(298,7)(206,10) I(482,10)(237,9)neat town and a good
harbour,(317,9)entered,(874,9) bounding(709,6)joy at my unexpected
escape.

(325,9)occupied in fixing the boat(127,6)rra(873,6)the sails, several
people crowded(775,13)spot. They seemed much surprised(156,6)
(784,16)instead of offering me any assist(827,6)whispered
together(954,6)gestures that at any (991,6)time might have produc(249,6)me
a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked(107,6)they
spoke English, and I therefore address(815,6)m in(166,6)language. “My
good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me(955,6)ame of
this(579,10)inform me (730,8)am?”

“You will know(308,6)soon enough,” replied a man(600,6)a hoarse voice.
“Maybe you are come to(844,8)(393,6)will not prove(522,6)to your taste,
but y(143,8)not be consulte(234,8)your quarters, I promise you.”

(722,6)exceedingly(623,11)on receiving so rude an answer from a
stranger(445,8)was also disconcert(76,6)(950,7)(815,8)frowning and
angry countenances of his companions. “Why do(313,6)(133,6)me so
roughly?” I(384,8). “Surely it is not the custom of(629,8)men to
(234,6)e (207,8)s so inhospitably.”

“I do not know(620,8)the man, “w(728,7)(102,11)the
(735,7) may b(950,8)t i(1015,6)(44,13) Irish to hate villains.”

While this(165,8) dialogue continued, I(361,8)(821,6) crowd rapidly
increase. Their faces exp(871,7)a mixture of curiosity and (486,7)which
annoyed(812,7) some degree alarmed me. I inquir(140,7)way to the inn, but
no one(439,10)I then moved forward(604,6)a murmur(655,6)und arose(649,6)the
(235,6)as they follow(164,7)surrounded me, when an ill-looking man
approaching tapped me on the shoulder(81,6)aid, “Come, sir, you must
(121,6) (981,6)Mr. Kirwin’s to giv(837,6)ccount of yourself.”

“Who is(55,11)? Why am I(63,23)myself? Is not
this a free(849,6)ry?”

“Ay(168,7)free enough for honest folks.(176,11) is a magistrate,
and(892,6)re(203,23)the death of a gentleman who was
found murdered here last night.”

This(990,8)startl(436,7)but I presently recovered(258,7). I was innocent;
that could easily be proved; accordingly I(557,10)my conductor in silence
and was led t(691,6)(946,7)best houses i(554,6)town(143,8)ready to sink from
fatigue and hu(855,6)but being(683,12)by a(961,6), I thought it politic
to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into
apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did(933,8)expect the calamity that
(392,6) a few moments to overwhelm m(255,6)extinguish in horro(864,6)despair
all fear of ignominy or(614,6).

I must pause here, for it requires(284,8)fortitude to recall the memory of
the frightful events which I am about(62,6)late, in proper detail, to my
recollection.

with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards(805,13)s,

agony. The examination,(995,6)resenc(681,8)(618,11)(232,6)itnesses,
passed like a dream from my memory(763,6)I saw the lifeless form of Henry
Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and thr(610,6)myself on
(522,8), I exclaimed, “Have my (885,6)ous mach(247,7)s deprived you
also, my dearest(164,6), of life? Two I have already destroyed;(898,6)
victims await their destiny; but you, (248,7), my friend, my
benefactor—”

The human frame(966,9) longer suppor(788,6)agoni(946,8)I endured, and
(781,6)carried out(751,8)room in strong convulsions.

A fever succeeded(825,6)is. I lay for two months(649,6)e point of death; my
ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called(479,8)the
(448,6)er of William, of Justine(536,6)of(345,8). Sometimes I entreated my
attendants to assist me i(192,6)destruction(776,8)fiend by whom I was
tormented; and at(511,6)s I fel(404,6)fingers(847,9)onster(571,9)grasping
my neck(732,6)screamed alou(1022,6) agony(762,6)error. Fortunately(343,7)spoke
my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me(661,6)my gestures and
bitter cries(416,6)sufficient to af(432,6) the(761,6) witnesses.

Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was(1017,7), w(60,12)
sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming
children,(174,6)nly hope(409,8)ir doting parents; how(68,7)rid(275,7)youthful lovers have been one day(578,8)bloom of health and hop(676,7)the
next a pre(838,6)worm(211,6)(642,6)cay(931,8)tomb! Of what materials was I
made(1011,8)could thus resist so(265,6)shocks, which, like(92,6)urning of
the wheel, continually renewe(151,6)torture?

But(774,6) doomed to live and in two months foun(968,9)as awaking from
a dream, in a prison, stretched on a w(14,8)bed, surrounded by
gaolers, turnkeys, bolts(842,6)all(888,6)(629,9)apparatus of a dungeon.
It was morning, I remember, when I(344,6)awoke to(834,8)anding; I had
forgotte(518,6)particulars o(447,7)had happened and(652,6)felt as if some
great misfortune had suddenly overwhelme(958,10)(164,7)looked around
and saw(659,6)arred window(618,10)squalidnes(780,8) room in(556,6) I
was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.

This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping(521,6)chair beside
me. She was a hired nurse(973,6)wife of one(818,9)(524,9)and her
countenance expresse(543,8)ose bad qualities(250,7)often characterise
that class. The lines(1000,6)r face were har(477,6)rude(878,9)at of
persons accust(828,8)see without sympathis(271,7)sights of(711,6)y. Her
ton(203,12)her entire indifference; she add(242,7)me in English,
(518,8)voice struck me as on(180,7)I(692,6)eard during my sufferings.

“Are you better now, sir?” said she.

I replied i(800,6)same language, with a feebl(147,7), “I believe I am;
but if it be(992,6)rue, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry(209,8)am
still alive to feel this(356,7)(569,6)orror.”

“For(450,6)matter,”(204,9)the(719,10), “if you mean about the
gentleman(29,6)urdered, (222,10)that it(577,6)(328,7)for you (84,6)
were dead, for I fancy it will go(633,6)with you! However, that’s none
of my business;(287,7)ent to(856,6) you and get you well; I do my duty
(429,7)safe consci(623,6)(194,8)well if everybody di(620,6)same.”

I turne(176,7)loathing from(984,6)oman who could utter so unfeeling a
speech to a (858,6) just saved, o(617,6)very edge of death; but I felt
langui(946,6)unable to reflect on(615,6)hat had passed(1024,6)whole series(345,7)life appear(987,6)(847,6)a(654,6); I sometimes doubted(701,11)it(486,6)(729,10)for it never presented itself to my min(503,7)the force
of reality.

As the images(983,6)floated before me became more distinct, I grew
feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed
me(168,10)(788,6)(1001,6) of lov(65,6)dear hand supported me. The
physician came and prescribed medicines, an(924,15) prepared
them for me(520,6)(603,6)carelessness was visible i(582,6)first(89,9)
expression of brutality was strongly marked(66,8)visa(645,6)the
second. W(739,9)be interest(53,10)fate of a murderer but the
hang(805,8)would gain his fee?

These(913,6)my(193,6)(728,8)ions,(774,7)soon learned(745,6)Mr. Kirwin had
shown me extreme kindness. He had cause(993,6)best room(313,8)prison
to be(390,9)(385,7) (wretched(771,8)wa(685,6)best); and it was (881,6)
had provided a (530,10)and a nurse. It is(836,7)he seldom(565,6)to
see m(862,7)although he ardently desi(961,7)relieve the sufferings of
every human creatur(110,6)did not wish (248,9)sent at the agonies and
miserable rav(92,7)(495,11). He came, therefore, sometimes to see
that I(890,6)ot neglected(485,6)hi(720,6)ts(527,6)short and(912,6)long
intervals.

One day, while(88,7)gradually recovering,(116,7)sea(693,7)a chair, my eyes
half ope(418,6)my cheeks livid like those in death.(200,7)overcome by gloom
and misery and often(722,8)ed I had better seek(80,6) than(467,7) to
remain(172,6)world which to me was replete(285,6)(674,8)(753,6)At one time I
considered whether I shoul(514,6)declare myself guilt(188,6)(587,6) the
penalty of the law, less innocent(193,6)poor Justin(885,6)been. Such(996,8)
(715,6)ts whe(894,6)door of my apartmen(847,6)opened and(1007,12)entered.
His countenance expressed sympath(387,6)compassion; he drew(514,8) close to
mine(927,6)dd(69,7)me in French,

“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anyth(26,6)
make you more comfortable?”

“I thank you(789,6)all(113,6)you mention is no(82,8) me; o(329,6)whole
earth(905,6)(43,6)(103,8)(580,7)I am capable of receiving.(131,6)know(230,8)e(331,10)of a stranger can be but of little relief to
one borne down as you are by so(72,8) a misfortune. Bu(233,6)will, I
hope, soon qui(374,7)melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can
easily be brought to fre(388,6)from the criminal charge.”

“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of(210,9)events, become
the most miser(371,8)mortals. Persecut(742,7)tortured as(423,6)and
have been, can death be any evil(517,6)?”

“N(535,7)indeed could be(621,6)un(361,6)at(746,7)gonising(956,6)the
(407,8)chances(748,6)have lately occurred. You(979,6)thrown,(473,6)me
surpr(88,6)accident,(673,6)is shore, renowned for its hospitality,
seized immediately,(969,6)harged with murder. The first sight(927,6)was
presented(913,7)r eyes was the body of(26,6)friend,(85,7)ed in so
unaccountable a manner and(1020,6)d, as it were(258,9) fiend across
your path.”

As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstand(402,6)e agitation I endured on
this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt consid(634,7)(411,7)e at
the knowledge he seem(301,6)possess(753,8)ing me. I suppose(488,6)astonishment was exhibit(318,6)my countenanc(932,7)(251,11)hastened
to say,

“I(495,10) upon(436,6)being taken ill, all the paper(674,7)were on(364,7)erson(668,6)(1013,8)me(578,6)I examined them(736,6)I might discover(711,6)trace by which I(845,7)sen(593,10)relations an (555,7)(596,9)mis(880,6)e

(159,8)ed from its commencement to be(28,6)(725,6)ather. I instantly wrote
to Geneva; nearly two months(1007,6)elapsed since the departure(625,7)(183,6).
But you are ill; even now you tremble;(35,9)unfit for(735,11)of any
kind.”

“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;
tell me what new scene of death has been acted(544,6)whose murder I am
now to lament?”

“Y(348,6)mily is perfectly well,”(982,6)(998,11)with
gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”

I know not(655,6)at chain of th(737,6)the idea presented itself, but it
(516,10)dar(933,6)to my mind(839,6)th(252,8)er had(143,9)mock at my
misery and taunt me with(548,7)ath of Clerval, as a new incit(680,6)for
(231,6)comply(64,6)his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,
and cried out in agony,

“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not
let him enter!”

(460,11)regarded(246,9)a troubled countenance. He could not help
(59,6)ing my exclam(766,6)as (439,6)ump(783,8)my guilt and(593,6)in
rather a severe tone,

“I should(954,6)(530,7), young man,(478,10)(542,6)ce of y(712,6)ther

“My(83,7)!”(411,7)I, whi(919,6)ry feature and(18,7)muscle was relaxed
from anguish to pleasure. “Is m(100,8) indee(679,6)? How kind, how
very kind! But where is he, why does he(416,6)asten to me?”

My change of manner surprised and(145,6)ed(818,6)agistrate; perhaps he
(922,10)at my former(506,13)was a momentary return of delirium(740,6)now h(397,6)(962,6)resumed his(88,8)benevole(638,8)rose and
quitt(171,7)room(942,6)my nurse, and in(136,9)(350,11)entered it.

Nothing, at this(183,7),(743,7)have given me greater(440,9) than the
arrival(740,7)(638,6). I stretch(971,7)(1009,8)to(961,6)(1000,8),

“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth(14,6)rnest(459,7)(556,7)calm(953,12)ssurances of their welfa(668,8)ndeavoured, by
dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my
desponding spirits; but he soon fel(559,7)a prison cannot be the abode of
cheerfulness. “W(52,7)lace is(416,6)that you inhabit, my son!”
said he, looking mournfully(479,6)e barred windows and w(418,8)appearance
(315,6) room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems
to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”

The nam(912,6)y unfortunat(428,6)murdered friend(856,6)n agit(873,6)too
great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.

“Alas! Yes,(793,10),” replied I; “some destiny(588,7)
most horrible kind hangs over m(887,7)I must live to fulfil it, or surely I
sh(866,10)died(642,7) coffin of Henry.”

We were not allow(391,6)converse for any length of time, for the
precarious(272,6)(935,7)health ren(359,6)every precaution necessary that
could en(1019,6)ranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted(767,6)my
str(164,6)(254,7)(774,7)exhausted by too much exertion. But the
(675,10)(563,7)(442,6) was to me like(877,6)(596,6)good angel(412,7)
gradually recovered(269,10).

As my sickness quitted me, I(643,6)bsorb(172,6)a gloomy and black
melanchol(310,6) nothing (318,6)dissipate. The image of(790,8) was
for ever before me, ghastl(104,6)(792,8). More than once the(798,10)
into which these reflections threw me made my(868,7)s dread a dangerous
relapse. (821,6)Why did they preserve so miserabl(957,6)detested a
life? It was(768,8)that I might(802,8)my(880,8),(184,7)is now
drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguis(254,7)
throbbings and relieve me from the(142,6)y weight of a(66,9)at bears
me to the dust; and, in executing(390,6)ward of justice, I shall also
sink to rest. The(1019,6)(735,14)(200,6)was distant, although the

motionles(273,6)speechless, wishing for som(282,9)revolution that

The season of(685,6)ssizes approached. I had already been three months
in prison(977,6)(275,9)(925,6)still weak and in continual(723,7) of a(725,8)(980,8)obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles(508,8)country
town wher(893,6)cour(743,6)held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every
care of collecting witnesse(684,6)arranging(803,6)fence.(241,8)pared
the disgra(573,6)(587,6)ing publicly as a criminal, as(202,6)ase was not
brought befo(211,13)that decides on lif(999,8)ath. The grand
jury rejected the bill, o(524,6)being proved(855,6)(385,7)(770,6)Orkney

after my removal(546,7)liberated(1016,6)(588,6).

My father(852,6)nraptured on finding me fre(59,8)the vexations(599,6)(351,8)(495,7),(227,12)again allow(618,6)breath(570,6)fresh

participate in these feelings, for to m(688,6)wall(186,6) dungeon or a
palace were alike hateful(490,6)cup of(517,6)was poisoned for ever, and
(923,9)the sun shone upon me, as(12,6)the happy and gay of heart, I
saw around me nothing but a dens(648,6)frightful darkness, penet(491,6)by

first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt(804,13)tri(709,6)awaken in(596,8)(620,8) of affection. He talked
of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but
(726,6)words only drew deep groans(988,6)(445,13), indeed, I felt a
wish for happines(379,8)ought with melancholy de(577,6)of my beloved

despair. At (496,6)moments I often endeavour(650,6)put an end to the
existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendanc(384,6)vigilance
to restra(742,6)from committing some dreadful act of violence.

Yet one duty remain(828,6)me, the recoll(810,6) of(791,7)finally

Still, as I urged our leaving Irelan(351,7)such inquietud(912,6)impatience,

itself(903,7)imagi(163,8)the remembrance of(1000,7)I(63,6)rved in my
convalescence. I(966,6)ed (244,11) and maintained a continual silence
concerning the(674,8)I had created.(15,7)a persuasion(988,7) should be
supposed mad(294,8)is in (240,7)(800,6)for ever have ch(154,6)my tongue. But,
besides, I could not b(580,7)(318,8)disclose a secret(301,7)(105,7)ill my
hearer with conster(286,13)ke fear and unnatural horror the inmates of
his breast. I checked, therefore,(738,7)atient thirst for sympathy and was
silent(735,8)(284,6)have given(396,6)orld to(299,7)onfid(999,7)fatal(246,7).
Yet, still, words like those I(362,6)recorded(391,7)burst uncontrollably
from me.(374,9)offer no(597,13)of them, but their truth in part
reliev(170,7)burden of my mysterious woe.

Upon(808,6)occ(601,6)my father said,(441,6)an express(130,7)unboun(208,6)nder,
“My dearest Victor, what infatu(785,6)is this? (45,7) son, I entreat
you never to(540,6)such an asser(853,6)gain.”

“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the su(910,6)the heavens, who
have view(774,6)operations, can bear witness(325,7)truth. I am the
assassi(409,7)ose most innocent victims; they died by my machi(780,6)s.

The conclu(527,8)this speech convinc(336,6)(587,7)that my ideas were
deranged, and he instantly chang(874,7)subject of our convers(778,6)and
endeavoured to alter the course(436,8)houghts. He wished as much as
possible to obliterat(256,6)memory(885,7) scenes(207,6)had taken place in
Ireland and(711,7)allud(155,6)them or suffered me to speak(928,6)

As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my
heart,(517,7)no longer talked in(358,6)ame incoherent manner(753,7)own
crimes; sufficient for me was(368,7)nscious(811,8)them. By the utmost
self-violence I curb(489,7)imperious voice of wretchedness, which

A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I recei(962,7)
following letter from Elizabeth:

“My dear Friend,

“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”



T(347,11)revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of
the fiend—“_I(341,6)be with you(268,9)wedding-night!_” Such was my sentence(342,6)on(593,7)ight(972,7)the
dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of
(313,9) which promised partly to console my sufferings. O(151,13)he
had determined(58,8)um(942,6)is crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a
deadly struggle(241,10)n assuredly take place, in(188,7)if he were
victorious I should be at peac(279,6)his(902,7)over me(34,7)an end. If he
were vanquished,(80,14) free man. Alas! What freedom?(469,6)as the
peasant enjoy(776,7)his family have been massacre(620,9)his eyes, his
cottage burnt, his lands laid wast(568,7)he is turned adrift, homeless,
penniless(956,6)alone, bu(191,6).(657,7)(314,8)my liberty except(660,6)in my

remors(690,6)guilt(658,7)(753,6)pursue me until(575,7)

Sweet and beloved (1022,9)! I read and reread her(1001,7)(860,6)some
softened feelings stole into my hear(100,6)dar(730,6)whisper paradisiacal
dreams of lov(891,6)joy; but the apple was already eaten(998,6)the
angel’s arm b(107,8)drive(959,9)all hope. Yet I(798,7)die to make
her happy. If the monster execute(762,6)threat,(904,6) was inevitable; yet,
again, I considered whether my marriag(930,8)hasten my fate. My
destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner(642,6)if my torturer
(961,7)suspec(634,7)I postponed it, influe(606,8)his menaces, h(163,7)
surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed
_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not(327,9) that
(385,6) as binding him to peace in(444,6)eantime, for as if to show me(74,6)h(597,6)not yet satiated(157,6)blood, h(189,6)mur(456,6)Clerval immediately
after the enunciation of(560,11)s. I resolved, therefore,(405,6)if my
(84,9) union(293,7)y cousin(977,7)conduce either to hers or my
father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life(556,8)not retard it a single hour.

In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and
affectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little(211,10)
remains for us on earth; yet all(745,8)may one day enjoy is centred in
you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do(978,7)ecrate(313,9)and my endeavour(152,6)contentment. I have one secret,(297,10), a
(829,9)one; when revealed(132,7), it will chill(171,6)fram(843,6)
horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you(88,6)only
won(872,8) I survive w(335,6)have endured. I(143,7)onfide(535,6)tale of
(93,6)(141,6)error(330,8)th(398,6)(818,6)our marriage shall take place,
fo(536,6)sweet(773,7)(827,7) must be perfect(135,8)nce between us. But
until(277,7)I conjure(340,6)do not men(946,6)r allude to it. This I most
earnestly entreat(365,6)I know(327,10)comply.”

In about a week(244,7)the arrival of(816,10)’s(814,9)e returned
to Geneva. The(266,7)girl welcomed (514,7) warm (861,9), yet tears were
in her eyes as she behel(700,6)maciated(595,7)and feverish cheeks. I saw a
change (81,7)also. She was thinner and had lost much of(918,6)heavenly
vivacity(23,7)ad before char(217,6); but her gentleness and soft looks of
compassion made(151,6) more fit companion for one blasted and(776,6)able as I
was.

The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not(786,7). Memory brought madness
with i(558,7)when I th(36,6)of(860,6)had passed, a real insanity possessed
me; sometimes I was furiou(278,6)burnt(525,6)rage,(45,11)low and
despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,
bewildered by the multitude of(339,6)ies(497,6)overcame me.

(752,9) alone had the power to draw me from these fits;(519,11) voice
would soothe me(348,6)transport(156,6)(536,8)and inspir(43,6)ith human
feelings(411,6)sunk in torpor(728,7)ep(342,7)(794,8)or me. When reason
(946,8), she (155,6)remonstrat(850,6)endeavour to(142,16)
resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be (54,6)ed(424,6)(40,7)
guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxur(60,10)
otherwise(635,11)found in indulging the excess of grief.

Soon after my arrival my fa(633,11)of my immediate marriag(281,7)(562,9). I remained silent.

“Have you, then(757,6) other attachment?”

“None on ear(78,6)love (658,11)nd look forward to our union(422,6)delight. Let the da(360,7)fore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate
myself, in life or death, to the happin(332,7)my cousin.”

“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy mis(557,6)es have befallen
us(982,6)let us only cling clos(902,6)what(365,7)s and(856,6)fer our love
(661,6)ose whom we(103,6)lost(200,6)(27,7) yet live. Our circle(276,6)be
small but bound(131,6) by the t(679,7)affect(968,8)mutual(225,11).
And(1023,7)ime shall(245,6)softened your despair, new and(331,6)objects of
car(155,9) born to replace(237,7)of(240,14)been so cruelly
deprived.”

Such were(858,6)esson(468,8)(770,6). But to m(36,6)remembrance of the
threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had
yet(171,6)in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as
invincible,(526,6)hat(369,6)he had pronounced the words “_I(396,7)b(972,7)you on(397,6)wedding-night_,”(131,10)(124,7)the (253,6)ened fate as
unavoidable(318,6)death was no evil(336,7)if(375,6)o(840,6)(1000,10)were
balanced with it(217,6)I(973,10),(26,6)a contented and even cheerful
countenance, agre(81,8)(482,9)(300,6)i(968,11) would consent, the
ceremony(390,8)take (631,6)in ten days(381,8)us put, as I imagined,
the sea(256,6)y fate.

Great God! If for one instant I had thought(1015,6)might b(693,6)hellish
intention(703,8)iendish adversary, I(218,7)r(249,6)(799,6)anished myself
for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over
the earth than(1004,6)(337,7)ed to this miserable marriag(562,6), as if
possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real(278,10)s;(186,6)hen I(335,9)tha(354,8)prepared only my own(698,6), I
has(741,6)that of a far dearer victim.

A(982,6)period fixed(465,6)ur(226,9) drew nearer, wheth(366,8)cowardice or
a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within m(879,7)I concealed my
(60,7)s by an appearance of hilarity(773,6)br(614,6)smiles and joy(430,6)e(843,12)(612,8)ather, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer
eye(1009,13). She look(304,6)ward to our union(1002,6)placid(1007,8)ment,
not unmingl(986,8)a little fear, which past misfortunes had impress(923,6)a(862,7)now(293,7)ed certain(983,6)angible happiness(906,7)soon dissipate
into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.

Preparations were made for(349,8)nt, congratulatory visit(47,7)r(396,7),
and all wore a smiling(524,11). I shut up, as well as I could, in(788,7)
(633,6)the anxie(572,8)prey(503,6)re(212,6)nter(404,8)seeming earnestness(296,6)the plans(595,15)al(932,6) they(360,7)only serve as the
deco(290,8)(659,6)tragedy. Through(679,10)’s exer(335,6)a part of
the inherit(789,8)(664,9) had been restored to her by the Austrian
government. A small possession on the shores of Como belong(85,9). It
was agreed that, immediately after(790,10), we should proce(160,6)Villa
Lavenza and spend our first days of(713,11)beside the beautiful lake
near(836,7)it stood.

I(209,6)meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the
fiend(196,8)openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger
constantly about m(635,6)was ever(376,8)watch to prevent artifice, and
(461,6)s(207,6)s gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed,(653,8)period approached, the threat(876,7)ed more as a delusion, not to be
regarded as worthy to disturb(325,6)ace, whil(432,6)(453,10)I hoped for
(944,6)marriage(1017,8)(210,8)(1017,10) of certainty(855,7) day fixed
for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of
as an occurrence(593,7)no accident c(711,6)ossibly(426,8).

(910,10)seemed happy;(1005,7)nquil demeanour contributed(448,6)ly to
calm her mind. But(916,8)day that was to fulfil my wishe(626,6)my
destiny, she was melancholy,(662,7)presentiment of evil pervaded her;
and perhaps also she thought of(382,6)readful secret(893,7)I had
promis(1000,6)reveal to h(747,10)following day. My father was in the
(950,9)overjoyed, and,(32,7) bustle of preparation, only recognised in
the(264,11) of his niec(668,6)diffide(616,7)a bride.

After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my
(211,6)’s, but i(444,6)agreed(460,6)(564,10)(671,6)should comm(141,6)ur
journey by water, sleeping(528,6)night at Evian and(733,8)ing our
voyage(378,23)T(840,7)was fair, the wind favourable;
all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.

Those wer(1013,6)last moments of my life during(563,9)enjoyed the
feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot(363,6)we
were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we(141,13)beauty(754,8)scene, sometimes on one side(790,8)lake, where we saw
Mont Salêve(350,6)pleasant banks of Montalègre(933,7)t a distance,
surmounting all(420,6)beautiful Mont Blanc(995,6)the(652,8)age of snowy

ambition(778,6)would quit its native country(276,7)n almost
in(273,8)able barrier(89,7) invader who(849,8)wish to enslave it.

I took the ha(523,6)(912,9). “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If
you knew what I have suffered and(25,8)may yet endure, you(242,6)
(380,13)let me tast(831,6)quiet and freedom(712,6)despair(1024,6)this
on(966,6)at least permits me(248,6)joy.”

“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied(261,10); “there is, I hope,
nothing to distress you; and be assured(610,7)f a lively joy is not
painted in my face, my heart is contented. Some(113,6)whispers to me
not to depend too much on(866,6)rospect(745,7)s opened before us, but I
will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move
along and ho(773,6)clouds, which(837,11)obscure and(859,11)rise

(192,6)ear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble(966,6)lies at
the bottom. What a divi(677,6)! How(646,6)(266,6)erene all nature

Thus(919,10) (815,9)ed(642,6)vert her thoughts and mine(811,6)all
reflection upon melancholy subjects. Bu(72,7)emper was fluctuating;
joy for a few instants shone in her eye(601,7)it continually gave place
(824,8)a(145,6)and reverie.

The sun sank lower i(721,6)heavens; we passed the river Drance and
o(678,6)d its path through(665,6)hasms of(84,6)igher an(76,6)glen(28,8)

I had been calm dur(625,8)day, but so(793,6)as n(729,6)(538,7)(1010,7)apes of objects, a thous(869,10)arose in my mind. I was anxious

of my adversary was extinguished.

Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid (346,8)ful silence,
but there was something(375,7)glance(905,7)communicate(288,6)or to her, and
trembling, she asked, “What is it(312,6)(168,6)es you, my dear Victor?
(46,11)you fear?”

“Oh! Peace, p(7,6)my love,” replied I; “thi(625,7)(149,6)all will be safe; (242,6)(38,8) is dreadful, very(15,9).”

I passed an hour in(61,6)state of mind, when s(834,8)I(959,11)how
(374,8)(515,6)mbat(650,7)I momentarily exp(1011,6)(601,6)be to my wife,
and I earnestly entreated her to retire,(679,7)ing not to join her

She left me, (150,6)continu(78,8)time walking up and down the passages
of the house and inspecting(907,7)corne(792,6) might afford a retreat to
(815,12). But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to
conjecture(989,6)some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the
execu(304,8)his menaces(541,17)heard a shrill(286,6)(643,7)
scream. It came from the room into(910,7)Elizabeth had(508,7)d. As I
(97,6)it, the whole truth rushed(72,6)my(701,7)my arms dropped, the
mo(507,8)(396,6)muscl(424,6)fibre was suspended; I could fee(745,6)blood
trickling in my veins and ting(25,8)the extremities(625,7)limbs. This
(880,6)lasted but for an instant;(690,6)cream was repeated(674,8)(249,6)
in(733,7)room.

Great God! Why did I(823,6)hen expire(27,6)am I here(875,6)late the
destruc(808,8)the best hop(726,6)the purest creature on earth? She was
there, lifeles(290,6)inanimate, thrown across(101,7)d, her head hanging down
and her pa(433,7)distorted f(129,6)s half (803,8)by(74,6)air. Everywhere I
turn I see(353,6)ame figure—her(484,6)(176,6)rm(471,6)relaxed form flung
by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold thi(550,6)live? Alas!
Life is obstinat(654,6)clings closest (186,6)it is most hated. For a moment
onl(493,8)lose recollection; I fell sens(397,6)o(674,6)ground.

When I re(321,8)I found myself surround(347,6)the people(545,8)inn; their
countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others
appeared only as a mockery, a shadow(669,8)fee(305,6)that op(114,8)me. I
escaped from them (816,11)(348,7)la(464,6)body of Elizabeth, my love, my
wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been mov(130,11)
posture in which I had first beheld her(1001,6)now, as she lay(802,11)upon
her arm and a handkerchief(866,15)her fac(962,6)neck, I might have
suppose(872,6)asleep. I rushed toward(70,6)and embrac(46,7)with ardou(467,6)

T(944,9)ous mark(576,9)iend’s grasp was on her(294,7)and the
(703,6)(135,15)issue(604,6)her lips.

While I still hung over her i(890,6)agony of despair, I happen(224,6)look up(184,6)window(312,9)room(605,7)fore(612,6)darkened(566,6)I felt a kind of

A grin(448,8)the(751,6)(211,9)nster; he seem(582,6)jeer, as(707,6)his

leaped(614,7)is station(667,6)running(901,6)the swift(871,8)lightning,

The repor(511,9)(159,7)brought a crow(57,11)room. I(281,11)

boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we

house(346,6)my head whirled round, my step(393,7)like tho(752,6)a drunken

eyes(800,6)my sk(962,7)parched(726,10)heat of fever. In t(779,8)e I
was carried back(269,6)laced on a bed, hardly conscious of what had
happened; my eyes wander(279,8)(763,9) as if to seek something that
I had lost.

hung over it and joine(378,6)ad tears (997,6)irs; all(359,6)time no
di(168,6) idea presented itself to my mind(607,9)thoughts rambl(797,6)various subjects, reflecting confusedly on(79,6)sfortune(781,6)their
cause. I was bewildered,(642,6)cloud of wonder and horror. The death
of William, the execution of Justine(26,6)murder of Clerval(690,6)lastly

to row(713,6)ook an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from

to every gloomy(652,6)that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were
familiar to(181,6)(110,6)ppier time and(49,7)(376,6)contemplated(584,8) day
before i(211,6)company of her who was now but a shad(489,7)a recolle(810,6)
Tears streamed(1003,6)my eyes. T(664,8)had ceased for a moment(764,8)saw
the fish play(154,8)waters as they had done a few hours (204,6);(34,9)
then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as
a great and sudden change(221,6)sun(828,7)shine or(337,6)louds(854,7)lower,
but n(121,7)could appe(462,9)as it(225,10)(425,7)(221,7). A fiend had

so(838,6)able as I was; so frightful an event is singl(568,9)history of
man.

But why should I dwell(794,6)the incidents(909,6)followed this last
overwhelming(119,6)? Mine has(468,6)a ta(937,6)horrors; I have reached their
_acme_(939,6)w(1019,6)must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know
that, one by one, my friends were (395,9)away;(319,6) left desolate. My
own strength is exhausted(769,8)must tell, in(734,7)words,(188,6)remains of
my hideous narra(903,6)
I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk
unde(710,6)tiding(428,7)I bore. I see him now, excellen(802,6)ven(588,7)old
man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, f(817,6)(986,6)lost(445,6) charm an(461,8)delight—his(969,10), his more than daughter, whom he doted on with
all(632,6)affection which a man feels, who(736,8)decline of life, having
few(68,10)s, cling(138,7)earnestly to those(748,6)(450,6). Cursed, cursed

in wretchedness! He could no(498,6) (476,10)(828,7)(904,6)were accumulated
around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to
rise from his b(753,8)(740,9)days he di(537,6)my arms.

What then became of me? I know not; I(563,6)sensation(1005,6)chains and
darknes(941,7)the only object(729,7)pressed upon me. Sometimes,
indeed, I dreamt(779,8)(716,12)flowery meadow(415,6)pleasant vales
with(872,6)riends of my youth(901,6)I awoke and found myself in a
dungeon. Melancholy follow(965,8)by degrees I gained a clear
conception(120,7)miserie(586,6)situation and was(373,6)released(445,6)my
prison. F(946,12)called me ma(475,7)during many months, as I
understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.

Liberty, however,(43,10)a useless gift to me(31,6)I not(118,7)awakened to reason, (601,6) same time (37,14)venge. As the
memory of past misfortunes(570,16), I began(108,6)flect on their
cause—the monster whom I(328,6)reated, the(1017,6)able dæmon(40,11)
sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was poss(739,6)by a
maddening rage when I thought of him(459,7)esired and ardently prayed
(777,7)might have him with(966,6)grasp to wreak a great(626,7)gnal
(361,7) on his cursed head.

Nor did(528,6)te long confine itself to(514,9)wishes;(385,11)

The magistrate list(839,8)me with attention and kindness. “Be
assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or(165,6)ions on my part shall
be spa(348,7)discove(184,6)villain.”

“I thank you,” replied I; “(176,6), therefore, (814,6)

which, however wonderful, forces convi(973,7)The story is too connected to
be mistaken for a drea(969,7)(228,7)no motive for falsehood.” My

own heart a resolu(736,8)pursue my (724,10)to death(720,8)(900,10)

he became more(910,8)ve and(286,6)ested; I saw him(643,6)imes shudder(210,6)horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled(1021,6)disbelief, was painted
on his countenance.

When(552,7)conclud(468,6)narration, I said, “This is the being whom I
accus(221,6)for whose seizur(243,6)punishment I call upon you to exert your

your feelings(59,8)n will not revolt from the exec(780,6)of those
functions on(765,6)occasion.”

Thi(905,9) caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own
auditor. He had heard my (786,6)with that half kind of(244,6)f(25,6)is given
to a tale of spirit(825,6)supernatural events;(868,6)hen he was called upo(74,6)ct officially in consequence, the (429,6)tide of his(792,9)ity

every aid in(523,6)pursuit(888,6)the creature of(657,6)you speak(964,7)s to

“I do not doubt(686,7)e hovers near(280,6)pot(379,7)I(278,8)(964,6)if

As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrat(944,6)intimidated.
“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will(736,6) myself(377,9)it is(108,7)power to seiz(717,6)monster, be assured(481,9)shall suffer(234,12)proportionate to(651,11)(381,8)fear, from(639,6)you have

revenge is of no moment to you; yet(194,8)I allow it(279,7)a vice, I

Chapter 24


My present situ(669,6)was one in (576,6)all voluntary thought was
swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone
endowed me(813,6)strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and
(130,8)me to be calculating(71,6)alm at periods when(681,6)wise
(490,8)(985,9) would(791,6)been my por(323,7)My first resolu(306,9)to quit(821,7) for ever; my country,(336,6),(130,6)I

hateful. I provi(290,6)self(337,6)a sum of money, together(30,8)few jewels

And now my wanderings bega(569,9)re to cease but(484,6)life. I have

have lived I hardly know; many times(544,6)I stretch(665,7)ailing limbs upon
the sandy plain and prayed f(626,8). But(794,9)kept me alive; I dared
not die(871,6)eave(529,10)ary in being.

When I quitted(658,8)m(697,8)labour(693,8)gain some clue by(1013,7)I
might trace the steps of(74,6)endish enemy(192,6)my pla(782,6)unsettled,
and I(546,7)ed(322,6)hours round the confines(502,8)town, uncertain
what path I should pursue. As night approached I foun(777,9)at the
entrance(603,8)cemetery where William, Elizabeth(754,6)my father
reposed. I entered it and(124,12)(191,6)mb(771,7)mark(22,6)ir
graves. Everything was silent except the(480,6)(270,10)rees,(852,6)
were gently agitated by the wind; the(275,7)was nearly dark(962,6)the
scene woul(856,7)been solem(674,6)affecting even to an uninterested
observer. The spirit(448,9)departed seemed to flit a(499,6)and to

The deep grief(709,7)this (237,6)had at(771,7)excited quickly gave way to

and kiss(610,7)earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By(498,6)acred(56,7)on(997,8) kneel,(577,8)shades that(946,7) near me(35,8)

preserve my life; to execute(590,6)dear revenge will I again behol(675,6)sun(510,6)rea(693,6)green herbage of(450,6)(757,8)otherwise should vanish from my
eyes for ever. And I call on you,(897,18)(681,8)(33,8)(463,6)ing
ministers of vengeanc(367,6)ai(925,6)conduct me in my work. Let the cursed
and hellish monster drink(905,6)of agony; let him feel(159,7)spair(617,6)now
torments me.”

I had begun my adjuration(751,6)solemnity and an awe(1010,7)almost assured me

the furies possessed me as I conclude(376,7)rage chok(73,6)utterance.

I was answered through(897,6)tillness of night by a lou(410,6)fiendish
laugh. It rang on my ears long (412,6)avily; the mountains re-echoed
i(909,7)I felt as if all hell surround(228,6)with mocker(375,6)laughter.
Surely in(970,6)moment I(716,8)have been(309,11)by frenz(450,6)have
destroy(376,6)miserable existence but(97,7)y vow wa(438,12)that I
was (964,7)d for(737,10). The(182,9) died away, when a well-know(956,6)abhorred voice, apparently close to(371,7), addr(526,9)in an
audible whisper, “I am satisfied,(228,11)wretch! You(268,8)termined to live(425,8)(67,12)(810,6)darted towards(746,6)pot from(789,7)the sound proceeded,(335,7)e devil

full upon his ghastl(932,6)distorted shape as he fled(601,8)re than
mortal speed.

I pursued him(858,6)for many months this has(612,6)my task. Guid(618,6)a
slight clue, I followed the windings(218,8)Rhone(287,6)vainly. The
blue Mediterranean appear(1009,8)by a strange chance, I saw the(953,6)

took my passage(891,6)e same ship(478,6)he escaped, I know not how.

Amids(514,6)wilds of Tarta(991,7)Russia, although he still evaded me, I
have ever(341,10)i(511,6)track. Sometime(666,6)peasants, scared by

who feared that if I lost all trac(71,7)m I should despair(675,7)e,
left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my hea(517,7)I saw

on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand
what I have fel(628,6)(457,6)feel? Cold, want(863,7)atigue were the
least pains which I was destined to endure;(26,7)curs(891,6)some devil

(955,9)(435,6)rected my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly
extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties(719,11),
when nature, overcome by hunger, sank(395,6) the exhaus(732,6)a repast

I (598,8)(167,7)I could(163,6)course(308,9)rivers; but(422,6)æmon
generally avoid(129,6)se, as(319,8)h(848,6)a(55,6)population(397,7)
(397,8)chiefly collected. In other places human beings(936,6)seldom
seen(966,6)I (147,10)subsisted o(602,6)wild animal(446,7)crossed my
path.(463,6) money(936,9)and ga(1011,6)he friendship(592,8)villagers

which, after taking a small part, I always present(635,6)those who had
provided me(203,6)fir(205,6)utensils for cooking.

My lif(445,9)passed thus, was(867,7) hateful to(595,9)(810,7)during
sleep alon(505,7)(600,7) taste joy. O blessed sleep!(815,13)most
miserable, I sank to repos(712,7)my dreams lull(232,6)even to rapture. The
(944,13)guar(277,7)had (293,9)these moments, or rather hours, of
happines(1018,9)might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of
this respit(225,6)hould have sunk under my hardships. During(895,6)ay I was
sust(669,6)and in(238,6)ed by the hope of night, for in(374,6) I saw my
(724,7), my w(516,6)(354,6)beloved (934,7); again(57,7)the benevolent(970,6)enance of my father, hear(829,6)silver tones(37,7)Elizabeth’s

a toilsome march, I persuaded myself(894,8)was(589,6)ing until(304,6)(408,7)
com(827,6)(942,7)(431,7)then(154,6) reality in the arm(224,8)dearest(356,8). What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How(25,7)cling to
their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted(785,6)my waking(717,8)and
(267,8)(266,13)they still lived! At such(794,8) vengeance, that
burned within me, died in my heart(942,6)I pursued my path towards the
destruction of(738,6)æmon more as a task enjoin(733,6)heaven, a(67,6)mechanical impulse of some power of which(495,7)unconscious, than(73,8)ardent desir(713,8)soul.

What his feelings were whom(225,11)I cannot know. S(410,8), indeed, he
left marks in writing o(574,6)barks(265,8)trees or cut in stone(697,6)guided

over”—these word(199,7)legible in one(392,7)se
inscriptions—“you liv(934,7)my(350,7)is complete. Follow me; I
seek the everlasting ic(1024,6)the north, where you will(776,6)the misery of

enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many har(204,6)miserable
hours must you endure until(926,6)period shall arrive.”

Scoffing devil! Again do I vow(946,10); a(26,10)devote thee,
(132,9) fiend, to tortur(602,6)death. Never(414,6)I give up my search

Elizabeth(603,8)departed friends, who even now prepar(356,6)me the
reward(950,7)tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!

As I still(963,9)my journey to(677,10)ward, the snows thickene(662,6)the(675,6)increased in a degree almos(619,6)severe to support. The peasant(911,6)
shut up in their hovels(888,6)only a few(838,8)most hardy ventured forth to
seize the animals whom starvation had forced from(115,8)iding-places(73,6)ek for prey(182,6)river(180,6) covered(492,6)ice(173,6)no fish could be
procured(542,8)us I was cut off(131,6)my chief article of maintenance.

The triumph(499,7)enemy(385,11)with the difficulty(541,7)labours. One
inscription(875,6)he left was(385,7)se words: “P(632,6)! Your toils
only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we(976,7)soon enter
upon a(642,9)where your sufferings(903,6)satisfy my everlasting
hatred.”

My courag(969,6)perseverance(434,6)invigorated by(233,7)scoffing(242,6); I
resolved not to fail in my purpos(491,7)calling on Heaven(741,11)
me, I continu(550,8)unabated ferv(336,6) traverse immense deserts,
until the ocean appeared at a distanc(236,6)formed the utmost boundary
(819,7)horizon. Oh! How unlike i(504,6)(1018,7)blue seasons(877,7)

an(1017,7)a full heart thanked my guiding spiri(201,6)conducting me in
safety(380,8)place(769,7)I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,
to meet and grapple(624,6)him.

Some weeks before this period I had procured a sled(835,7)dog(972,6)thus

fiend posses(75,9)ame advantages(367,8)found that, a(188,9)I had
daily lost ground in(326,6)ursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that
when I first saw(878,11)he was but one day’s journey in(176,6)ce, and
(432,7) to intercept him(369,8)he should reach(876,6)each. With new
courage, therefore, I pr(296,6)on(715,6)in two days arrived at a wretched
hamlet o(272,6)seashore. I inquired(986,7) inhabitants concerning(423,11)and(322,8)accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,
had(165,9)the night(645,7), arm(917,7) a gun and many pistols,
putting to flight(184,17)of a solitary cottage through fear of
his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter
food(386,6)placing it in(816,9), to draw which h(89,6)seiz(640,6)a
numerous drove of tr(671,6)dogs,(51,8)harn(796,9)m(502,6)(806,8)

conjecture(928,6) he must(1020,6)ily be destroyed by(753,6)reaking(639,7)
ice or frozen(37,8)eternal frosts.

On hear(665,6)is(640,12) I suffered a temporary access of despair.

returne(797,7)like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.
After a s(995,6)repose, during(848,7)the spiri(1012,6)the dead hovered
round and instigated me to toi(297,6)revenge, I prepared for my (790,7).

I exchanged my land-(995,6) for one fashion(62,7)(457,6)equalities of
the F(728,6)O(519,7)nd purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I
departed from land.

I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I(30,6)(603,6)d

burning within my heart(715,7)(112,7)abl(394,9)support. Immense and

By the quantity(463,13)(966,8) had consumed, I(881,8)(460,6)that

despondency and grief(654,6)my eyes. Despair had indeed almost(282,7)d
her prey(437,8)(244,7)soon(689,6)sunk beneath(228,6)(669,6). Once, after

caught a dark spe(417,12)dusky plain. I str(199,6)my sight to
discover what i(890,8)b(694,6)uttered a wild cry of ecstasy(146,6)I

Warm tears fill(932,6)eyes(958,8)I hastily wiped away,(520,6)they might

ever done before. A ground sea was heard;(736,6)hunder(460,6)s progress, as
the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every(515,7)(336,6)ominous
and terrific. I (903,8)on, but in vain(653,6)wind arose(164,6)sea roared;
and, as(559,6)the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and crack(448,7) a

minutes a tumultuous(181,7)(298,7)tween me an(632,10)(479,8)was left
drifting on a scattered pie(503,6)ice that was(971,8)ally less(818,6)and
thus preparing for me a hideous death.

In this manner many appalling hours passed; several(706,7)dogs di(675,9)

No; I am not so selfish. Yet,(534,6)I am dea(792,6)he(520,8)appear, if

August 26th, 17—.


You(704,6)read this strange and terrific story, Margaret;(136,6)o you not
feel(201,6)blood congeal with horror, like(989,6)which(494,6)now curdles
mine? Sometimes, seized(70,6)sudden agony, he could not(235,8)e his
tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, utter(102,7)
difficulty(440,6)ords so replete(209,6)anguish(643,6)fin(301,6)lovely eyes
were now lighted up(268,6)indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow

volcano bursting forth(410,6)face would(482,7)ly change to an ex(110,6)on
(845,8)ildest rage(1018,6) shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.

His tale is connected(289,7)l(623,7)an appearance(967,8)simplest truth,
yet I own t(780,6)that the letters of Felix and Safie,(766,7)he showed me,
an(396,6)apparition(116,8)monster seen from our ship, brought to me a
greater convic(70,12)truth of his narrative tha(288,6)assever(309,6),
however earnest and(298,10). Such a(155,9)has,(498,7)really existence!
I cannot doubt it(896,6)I am lost in surpris(840,6)admi(137,6)(732,12)I
endeavour(814,6)gai(272,7)Frankenstein the particula(385,6)his
creature’s form(897,7)but on this point he was impenetrable.

“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your
senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself(950,6)he
world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseri(1006,7)do not seek
to increase your own.”

(326,13)discovered(723,6)I made notes concerning his history; he asked
to see them(193,8)n himself corr(881,10)augmented(46,6)in many places,
but principally in giving(869,6)if(563,6)spirit to the convers(716,6) he held
with his(312,6). “Sinc(470,6)have preserved my(802,8)on,(483,6)
he, “I would not(1002,6)a mutilated one should go down to
posterity.”

Thus has a week passed away, while I(141,6)listen(745,6)the strangest
tale(404,6)ever imagination formed. My thought(510,6)every feeling of my
soul(248,6)been drunk up by the interest for my guest which(814,6)tale
and his own eleva(470,8)gentle manners(352,6)(734,6)d. I wish to soothe
him, yet can I counsel(337,6)o infinitel(724,7)able, so destitute of
(228,6)hope of consol(997,7)to live? Oh, no! The only joy(735,6)he can
now know will be when he composes his shattere(631,12)peace and
death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspr(399,7)solitud(64,8)lirium; he believes(901,6)when in dream(729,6)olds(752,8)e (739,8)
friend(1020,7)erives from(973,6)communion(296,12) for his(357,6)ies or
excitements to his vengeance,(771,6)they are(789,7)(488,7)ions of(141,6)ancy, bu(32,6)beings themselves who visit him(168,8)e reg(71,8)a
remote world. This faith gives a solemnity(169,8)rev(200,6)that render
them to me almost as imposing and(762,9)ing as truth.

Our(360,8)(222,7)(244,8)always confi(946,7)(788,8)history and
misfortunes. On(917,7)point of general literature he displays
unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His
eloquence is forcibl(65,6)touching; nor(897,7)hear him,(768,9)relates
a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the pass(521,8)pity or love,
without tears. What a glorious(579,6)ure must he have be(767,6)the days
(608,6) prosperity(177,10)is thus no(233,8)godlike in ruin! He seems
to feel(438,9)worth(285,6)he greatnes(719,8) fall.

“When younger,” said he, “I(951,8)d myself destined for
som(86,7) enterprise. My feeling(603,6)profound(825,6)I possessed a coolness

for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talent(951,6)
might be useful to my fellow(551,9)s. When I reflected o(552,6)work I had
completed, no less a one tha(597,6)creation of a sensitiv(873,6)rational
animal, I could not rank(492,8)with the herd of common projectors. But
this thought, which(365,14)(746,7)commence(424,7) my career, now
serves only to plunge me lower(815,9)ust. All my speculations and hopes
are as nothing, and lik(971,6)archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am
chained in an eternal hell. My imagin(360,6)was vivid, yet my powers of
analysi(162,6)applic(53,7)ere intense; by the un(440,7)these qualities I
conceive(975,6)idea and execut(22,7)(506,14)man. Even now I cannot
recollect without passion my reveries whil(308,6)work was in(636,8). I trod
heaven in my(518,8)s, now exulting(29,7)(274,6)(27,6)burning(612,10)idea
(246,6)ir effects. From my infancy I(135,6)mbued(673,6)high(504,6)(352,6) lofty
ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once
was, you w(806,10)ecognise(734,9)is state of degradation. Despondency
rarely visited my heart; a(198,6)destiny seem(660,6)bear me on, until I fell,
never, never again to rise.”

Must I then lose(162,6)admirable being? I have longed for a(277,7);(28,7)
sought one who(260,7)sympathise(449,6)and love me. Behold, on(707,7)desert
seas(114,8)found such a one, but I fear(150,8)g(893,6)him only to know his
value(119,7)se him. I(417,7)reconcile him to lif(97,7)he repulses(835,9).

“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind(946,6)tions towards so

wher(1012,6)(147,10) are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,

such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I
gave existence;(122,6)my lot on earth(376,9)(130,6)led and I may die.”

My beloved Sister,

September 2d.


I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever
doomed to see again(693,6)Englan(154,6)the dear(847,9)s that inhabit
it.(83,6)surround(129,6)mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave(490,7)s(381,8)have(633,9)d to be my companions look towards me for aid(893,6)I have
none(61,6)stow. There is some(880,6)terribly appal(776,8)our
situ(976,7)yet(126,6)urag(571,6)hopes do not desert me. Yet it is
(90,7)e to reflect(365,6)the lives of all these men are endangered
through m(870,6)we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.

And what, Margaret,(686,9)the state of your mind? You(722,6)not hear of my
destruc(268,6)and y(41,8)anxiously await my return. Years(801,6)pass, and
(57,9)have visitings of despair(96,6)et be tortur(772,6)hope. Oh! My
(849,8)s(849,6)(209,6)ickening failing(221,9)heart-felt expectations is,
in prospect, more(529,8)e to me than my own death. But you(196,6)a husband
and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!

My unfortunate guest reg(747,8)with the tenderest(793,6)ssion. He
endeavours to fill(56,9)ho(935,6) talks as if life were a possession
(999,6)he valued. He remin(883,6)how often(594,6)ame accidents(897,6)happen(962,6)other navigators who(324,7)ttempted this sea(615,6)in spite
of myself, he fill(264,10)cheerful auguries. Ev(147,9)ilors feel
the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer(668,8); he
rouses their energie(734,6) while(60,6)hear his voic(20,7)believe(1007,6)
vast mountains of ic(992,6)mole-hills (385,6)will vanish befo(1003,6)
resolu(716,6)of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of

caus(930,6)this(966,8).

September 5th.


A scene has just passed of such uncommon int(725,6)that, although it is
highly probable that(339,6) papers may never reach you, yet I cannot
forbear recording it.

W(384,6)still surround(221,6)(425,16),(38,7)in imminent danger
of being crushed in(558,7)conflict. The cold is excessive(757,6)many of
my unfortunate comrade(856,6) already found a grave amidst(837,7)cene of
desolation. Frankenstein has daily declin(170,6)health; a feverish fire

lifelessness.

I mentio(183,7)my last letter the fears I entertain(620,6)(698,8).
This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his
eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was (269,7)by half

companions had been chosen(994,6)e other(160,8) to come in deputation
to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.
We were immur(839,6)ic(171,6)should probabl(1006,8)escape(655,6)they

course southwards.
(848,6)speech troubl(625,7)I ha(476,6)despaired, nor had I yet conceived
the idea of returning if set free. Yet(560,7)I(583,14)or even in
(485,6)ility,(595,7) this(846,7)? I hesitated before I answ(836,6)when
Frankenstein(908,6)had at first(799,6)silent(885,6)indeed app(634,6)hardly
to(458,6)force(557,11)attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,
(933,7) cheeks flushed(480,6)momentary vigour. T(314,7)towards the men,
he said,

“What do you mean? (18,12)(298,6) of your captain? Are you, then,
so easily turned from(51,6)design? Did you not call(394,6)a glorious
expedition? “And w(725,8) was it(43,9)? Not beca(466,6)e way was
smooth and placid as a(675,6)ern sea, bu(61,10)it was full of(911,8) and
terror,(104,9)at every new incident(279,6)fortitud(170,6)to be called forth

who encountere(262,8)for(162,7) and the benefit of mankind. And now,
behold,(787,6)the(936,7)imagination(489,10), or, if(338,6)ill,(50,10)

peril; and so, poor souls, they(533,6)chill(184,6)re(911,7)to their warm
firesides. Why, that requires not(924,6)preparation; ye nee(170,6)have come
thus fa(694,7)ragge(745,8)aptain(122,7) shame of a defeat merely to prove
yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your
purposes and firm as a rock. This ice i(231,6)made of such stuff as(72,6)hearts may be; it is mutabl(879,6)cannot withst(992,7)(587,8)say(341,6)it

He spoke(541,6)with a voice so modulat(620,9) different feelings expressed
in his speech(940,7)an eye so full of lofty design and heroism(690,7)can
you wonder(710,6)these(859,6)ere moved? They looked at one anothe(697,6)were
unable to reply. I(239,6); I told them(31,6)tir(516,7)onsider of(332,6)had

They(200,7)d and I turned t(891,6) my friend(114,6)he was sunk in languor and
almost deprived of life.

How all(560,8)ll terminate, I(646,9)(212,6)I had rather di(997,6)
(811,7)shamefully, my (996,7) unfulfilled. Yet I fear(975,6)will be my
fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory(616,6)onour, can never
willingly continue to endure(820,7)present hardships.

September 7th.


The die is cast; I(944,6)consen(831,7)(246,7)if we are not destroyed.
Thus are my hopes blas(207,7)cowardic(674,6)indecision; I come back
ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess
to bear(482,6)injustice(975,6)patience(262,13)12(263,6)It is p(258,7)am(667,7)ing to England.(285,8)lost(236,10)of utility
and(438,6)(328,9)(43,8)(701,6). But I(637,6)endeavour to detail these
bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while(185,6)wafted
(824,8)(187,7) an(844,10)you,(133,8)(458,7)pond(543,13)9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard
at a di(190,6) as(77,6)slands spli(491,6)cracked in every direction. We were
in(812,6)ost imminent peril(939,6)as we could only remain passive, my chief
attention was occupi(885,6)my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in
such a degree that he was entire(921,6)fin(834,6)his bed. T(339,7)(248,7)
behind us(456,6)as driven(692,6)force(440,9)the north; a breeze sprang from
the west(418,6)o(310,6)11th the passag(78,14)south became perfectly
free. Whe(377,6)sailors saw(858,6)and(243,6)their(812,7) to(16,7)native
country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,
lou(707,6)long-continued. Frankenstein, who(323,6)ozing, awoke and asked the
cause of the(120,7). “They(143,6),” I said, “be(46,6)they
will soon(240,11)(862,7).”

“D(928,7)then, really(283,7)?”

“Alas! Yes; I cannot withst(335,6)eir demands.(34,10)lead them
unwillingly to danger(909,6)I must(392,7)(141,8)so, if you will; but(1014,11). You may give up your purpose, but
mine is assig(714,7)me by Heaven(126,8)dare(84,6)I am weak(65,6)surely(619,6)pirits who assist my vengeance(152,6)endow me with
sufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavour(874,6)spri(785,7) the
bed, but the exer(1023,9)too great for him; he fell back and fainted.

It was long before(1009,8)resto(722,6)nd I often thought(808,6)life was
entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed(276,6)difficulty and was unable(252,6)eak. The surgeon gave him a composing
draught and ordered us to le(48,8)undisturbed. In the meantime he
told me(224,6)my friend had certainly not many hour(97,6)ive.

His sentenc(325,6)pronounc(327,10)could only griev(969,6)be patient. I sat
by his bed, watching(462,7)(327,7) were clos(421,10)(415,8)he slept; but
presently he call(756,9)in a feeble voice(890,6)bidding me come near,
said, (1010,7)The(703,9) I relied on is gone; I feel(554,6)I shall
soon di(103,7)he, my enem(504,6)persecutor, may still be in being. Think
not, Walton,(652,6)i(460,6)last moments of my exis(402,6)(146,12)burning
hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but(224,8)myself
justified in(67,6)(975,6)e death(140,7)adversary. Du(34,8)s(183,7)days I
have been occup(83,7)examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.
In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational(19,6)ur(667,6)was
bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
well-(459,10)(52,6)my duty, but ther(829,6)another(518,7)paramount to
that. My duties(155,9)the(553,6)(509,8)own species had greater claims to
my attention because they included a(55,9)proportion of(219,11)or
misery. Urged by this view, I refu(936,11)did right in(28,6)ing, to
(399,6) a companion for the first(413,9). He showed unparalleled malignity
and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends(25,7)voted to(36,6)uction
(342,7)who possessed exquisite sensations,(498,10)(998,6)wisdom(679,10)
know where(292,6)thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself(1008,6)he may
render no (556,6)wretched, he ought to die. The task of his(222,12) was
mine(643,6)I have failed. When actuat(474,6)(340,7) and vicious motives, I
asked you to undertake my unfinished work(526,8)renew(560,6)request now,
when I am only induc(604,6)reason(129,7)rtue.

“Yet I cannot ask(131,8)renounce your country and(504,8) to fulfil

little chance of meeting with him. B(1001,6) considera(851,8)these

approach of death. I dare (358,15)do(149,6)I think(991,6), for I
may still be misl(585,6)passion.

“T(725,7)should li(188,6)be an instrument of mischief(178,8)s me; in

Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillit(717,6)avoid ambition, even if it

science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this?(302,8)myself been
blasted in(742,6) hopes, yet an(444,6)may succeed.”

His voice became fainter as he spok(330,7)at length, exhaust(712,6)his
effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he
attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and
his eyes clos(578,7)ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed
away from his lips.

Margaret,(902,6)comment can I make on the untimely extinc(107,8)this
glorious spirit? Wha(68,8)(476,6)at will enable(1020,8)understand the
depth of my sorrow? All(63,6)I(995,8)express would be inadequate and
feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadow(493,6)a cloud of
disappointment. But I journey to(478,6)England(909,8)may there find
consolation.

I am interrupted.(285,6)do(718,7)sounds portend? It is midnight; the
breeze blows fair(540,7) the watch on deck scarcely stir. A(635,6)here
is a(111,6) as(551,6)human(811,6), but hoarser; it comes(561,6)the cabin
wher(628,6)remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.
Good night, my sister.

Great God!(656,6)a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the
remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall hav(841,6)power to detail
it; yet the tale which I(50,6)recorded(652,12)complete without(802,6)final and wonderful catastrophe.

I entere(469,6)cabin (365,6)l(607,6)(369,12)my ill-fated and admirable
friend. Over him hung a form(190,9)cannot find words to
describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its
proportions. As he(123,6)over(577,6)offin, his face was conceal(905,6)long
locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and
apparent texture like that(760,6)mummy. When he hear(845,6)(799,6)of my
approach, he ceased to utter exclamatio(771,6)grief and horror and sprung
towards(942,6)indow. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as(304,9), of
such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and
endeavour(216,6)recollect(890,6)were my duties(860,6)regard to this destroyer.
I called on him to stay.

He paused, looking on m(800,6)(782,7),(708,6)gain turning (309,11)
lifeless(709,6)of his creator, he seem(414,6)forget my presence,(237,6)very feature and gestur(60,9)instigat(650,6)(427,6)ldest rage of some
uncontrollable passion.

“That is also my victim!” he(558,6)imed. “In his murder my
crimes are consummated; the miserable serie(1021,8)being is wound to its
close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous(661,6)elf-devoted(73,6)! What does it
avail(813,6)I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably(532,9)d thee
b(18,9)ing all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold(876,6)annot answer
me.”

His voic(492,9)suffocated(574,6)my first impulses, which had suggested to
me the duty of obeying(20,6)ying request(364,7)friend in(202,12)his
enemy,(809,6)now suspend(577,6)a mixture of curiosity and com(567,8) I
approached(853,6)tremendous(486,6); I dared not(804,7)raise(986,9)to his
face, there was something so scaring and unearthly i(651,6)ugliness. I
attemp(298,6) speak, but(785,6)ords died away on my lips. The monster
continu(913,6)utter wild and incoherent(649,6)re(255,7)s. At length I
gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the temp(441,7)his(925,12)Your repentance,” I said, “is(446,7)perfluous. If you
had listen(272,6)the(645,7)of conscience and heed(758,6) stings of remorse

(977,12) would yet have lived.”

“And do you dream?” sai(150,6)dæmon. “D(32,6)think(998,8)was then
dead to agon(686,6)(195,7)? He,” he (478,9), pointing(284,8)corpse,
“he suffe(695,8)in(32,7)nsummation(436,8)deed. Oh! Not the

on, while my hear(109,6)poisoned with(479,8). Think(343,7)a(198,6)groans of Clerval were music to my ears? M(96,12)fashio(623,7)be

and hatred, it di(406,6)endure(726,6)iolen(729,6)the change without
torture such as you cannot even imagine.

“After the murder(258,12)I retur(846,7)Switzerland,(355,6)-broken

recollected my threat and resolv(400,8)it should be accomplished. I
knew(1021,6)(197,6)preparing for(494,7) a deadly (697,7), bu(49,8)the
slave, not(682,6)aster, of an impulse(299,9)detested yet could not
disobey. Ye(602,7)she died! Nay(334,7)(362,6)not(916,6)able. I had
cast off all(453,8), subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
(558,7). Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far,(135,6) no
choice but to adapt my nature to an element(577,9)had willingly
chosen. The completion(162,6) demoniacal design(154,8)(567,13)
(699,7). And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”

(718,6)at first touched by(301,7)pre(789,7)of his(395,6)y; yet,(443,6)I called
to mind what Frankenstein had said(69,8)powers of eloquence and
persuasion, and(96,8)again cast my eyes o(462,6)lifeless form(469,7)friend, (884,12)was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.
“It is well(851,6)you come he(466,6)whine over the desol(987,6)(48,8)

“Oh,(775,7)not thus—(9,8),” interrupted the being.
