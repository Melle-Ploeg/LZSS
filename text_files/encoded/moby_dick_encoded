  ETYMOLOGY.


  (Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School.)

  The pale Usher—threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him
  now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars,(264,8)queer
  handkerchief, mockingly embellish(315,9)ll the gay flags of(21,8)
  known nations(1244,8)world. He loved to dust(163,9)(150,8); it
  somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.

  “While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what
  name a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through
  ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the
  signific(952,9)the word, you deliver that which is not true.”
  —_Hackluyt._

  roundness or rolling; for in(70,11)t_ is arched or vaulted.”

  It will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of
  a poor devil of(114,10) appears to have gone(1019,8) the long
  Vaticans and street-stall(1300,9)earth, picking up whatever random
  allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,
  sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least,
  take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in
  these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As
  touch(2048,8)ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here
  appearing,(144,15) are solely valuable or entertaining, as
  affording a glancing bird’s eye view of what has been promiscuously
  said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many(1883,9)and
  generations, including our own.

  So fare thee well,(734,24), whose commentator I am.
  Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this
  world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too
  rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel
  poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them
  bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether
  unpleasant sadness—Give it up,(1253,8)s! For by how much the more
  pains ye take to please the world, by so(57,14) shall ye for
  ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the
  Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the
  royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends wh(1415,12)before
  are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of
  long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.
  Here ye strike but splintered hearts (530,8)—there, y(415,8)strike
  un(54,8)able(601,8)!

CHAPTER 1. Loomings.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having
little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me
on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see(1377,10)y part
of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
regulat(508,8)circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about
the mouth; w(53,8)it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul(52,10)
(105,14)involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially(136,10)my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping(1815,10)street, and
methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to
get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I
quietly tak(1367,9)ship. There is(837,9)surprising in this. If they
but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

There now is your insular city(1829,8)Manhattoes, belted round by
wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds(1641,9)her
surf. Right and left,(588,11)s take you waterward. Its extreme
downtown is the battery(1434,8)that noble mole is washed by wav(900,8)cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of
land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the(382,9)a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What
do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
thousands upon (15,10)of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
leaning against the spiles; some seated(99,8)e pier-heads; some
looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the
rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these
are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to
counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are
the green fields gone? What do they here?

But look! here come mor(721,8), pacing straight for(2021,10), and
seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
extremest limit(1178,8)land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
(1905,10) will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh(215,10)
as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of
them—leagues. Inlanders all, they co(1904,8)lanes and alleys,(1303,8)
and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet (141,10)all unite. Tell
me, does the magnetic virtue(1543,8)needles(1558,8)compasses of all
those ships attract them thither?

Once more. Say you are in the country; in(909,11)land of lakes. Take
(1838,8)ny path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a
dale, and leaves you there by a pool(154,8)stream(2016,11)magic in
it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest
(1269,8)—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will
infallibly lead you to(905,8)if water(223,8)e in all that region.
Should you ever be athirs(1291,8) great American desert, try this
experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for
ever.

But (439,8)an artist. He desires to paint(514,8) dreamiest, shadiest,
quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscap(359,11)e valley
of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his
trees, each(320,8)hollow trunk(1705,8)a hermit and a crucifix were
within; and here sleeps his meadow, a(1216,9)sleep his cattle; and up
from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands
winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in
their hill-side blue(1922,8)ough the picture lies thus tranced, and
(42,9)is pine-tree shakes down its sighs like(1083,8)upon this
shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the (47,11)eye were
fixed(83,8)e magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,
when for scores on(10,9)f miles you wade knee-deep among
Tiger-lilies—w(678,11)one charm wanting?—Water—t(1306,8)not a drop
o(1143,13)! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, w(1157,9)travel
your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon
suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy
him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian
trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a
(26,15)soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?
Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a
mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out
of sight of land(483,14)old Persians hold the sea holy(527,9)
the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely
all this(728,8)without meaning. And still deeper the(30,8) of that
story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild
image he saw(1938,8)fountain, plunged into it and was drowned(1290,8)at
same image, we ourselves se(1714,9)rivers and oceans. I(1707,9)image(1738,8)ungraspable phantom of life; and(321,9)the key to it all.

Now, when I say that I am(224,8)habit of going to sea whenever I begin
to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my
lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred(163,8)ever(838,10) as a
(810,9). For to go(836,15) you must needs have a purse, and a
purse is but a rag(1586,8)you have something in it. Besides,(942,10)s
get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy
themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I n(272,8)(1075,14);
nor,(1921,8)I am(187,11)of a salt, do(339,23)Commodore, or a Captain(14,8)ook. I abandon the glory and distinction
of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all
honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind
whatsoever(850,8)quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,
(1159,8)taking(31,9)ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.
And as for going as cook,—(432,9)confess (2014,9)considerable glory
in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I
never fancied broiling fowls;(145,8)once broiled, judiciously
buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered,(210,10)no one who
will speak mor(486,9)fully, not to say reverentially, of a(151,8)
fowl than I will(1337,8)out of the idolatrous dotings(26,8)old
Egyptians upon(239,8) ibis and roasted river horse,(1881,10)see the
mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.

No(1437,9)(1258,9), I(1238,9)simple sailor, right before the mast,
plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this(718,8)
thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,
particularly if you come of an old established family(2027,8)land, the
Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if
just previous to putting your hand(432,10)tar-pot,(1666,10)been
lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in
awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a
(110,12) to a(658,9)and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and
the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off
in time.

What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,
I mean,(591,8)scal(1056,8)e New Testament? Do you think the archangel
Gabriel thinks anyth(479,8)less of me, because I promptly and
(1364,12) obey that(280,11)in that (812,10) instance? Who ain’t
a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however(1369,8)(365,12)s may
(1092,14)—(48,11)y may thump and punch(1134,9), I have the
satisfa(593,9)knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is
one way or other served in much the same way—eith(1206,8)physical or
meta(16,9)point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is
passed round, and all hands should rub each other’(24,8)er-blades,
and be content.

Again, I always(1613,10) as(942,11)(562,8)they make a(199,9)
paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary,(65,12)themselves must
pay. And there(483,8)the difference(1463,8)world between paying and
being paid. The act of(34,8)is perhaps the most uncomfortable
infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being
paid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man
receives money is really marvellous, consider(798,9)we so earnestly
believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no
account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign
ourselves to perdition!

Finally(713,42)of the wholesome
exercise and pure air(1411,8)fore-castle deck. For as i(1636,8)orld,
head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if
you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for(646,10)part the
Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
the sailors(72,8)forecastle. He(1642,8)he breathes it first; but not
so. I(1326,19) do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
other things, at(1401,10)time(872,10)(56,8)little suspect it. But
wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the(1299,9)
merchant(1308,9)I(1407,8)now take it into my head to go on a whaling
voyage; this the invisible police office(643,9)Fates, who has the
constant surveillance(2020,8)and secretly dogs(22,9)influences me in
some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,
doubtless, my going o(797,8)haling voyage, formed part(904,8)grand
programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in
as a sort of brief interlude and solo(1526,9)more extensive
performances. I(464,9)that this(183,13)bill must have run
something like this:

“_Grand Contested Election(961,9)Presidency(1181,8)United States._
“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”

Though I cannot tell why(780,8)exactly(1717,8)ose stage managers, the
Fates, put me dow(198,8)is shabby(477,9)(754,9)(510,9)when
others were set(68,10)magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short
and easy(44,10)genteel com(46,11)joll(37,11)farces—though I
(271,16)this(273,12); yet, now that I recall all the
circumstances, I think I can see a(1168,8)into the springs and motives
which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced
me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling m(163,10)
delusion that(1328,8)a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
and discriminating judgment.

Chief among these(269,8) was the overwhelming idea(1077,10)eat whale
himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils(1492,8)whale; these, with all
the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,
helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things
would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an
everlasting itch(1065,8)ngs remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and
land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to
perceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let
me—since it is but well to be on friendly terms(467,9) the inmates of
the place one lodges in.

By reason of these things, then,(568,9)(1873,10) was welcome; the
great flood-gate(625,10)onder-world swung open, and i(758,10)
conceits that swayed(583,10)purpose, two and two there floated into
my inmost soul, endless procession(779,14), and, mid mos(1894,8)m
all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill(202,8)air.


CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.

I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitt(1420,8)good city
of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. I(1423,8)Saturday night
in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning(2031,8)e little
packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching
that place would offer, till the following Monday.

As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of(785,9)stop at
this same(307,12), thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well
be related that I, for one, had no(1681,9)so doing. For my mind was
made up(1248,9)in no other than a(358,11)craft, because there was a
fine, boisterous something about everything connec(1417,9)that famous
old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though(636,12) has
of late been gradually monopolis(737,8)busines(423,12)(568,8)ough
in this matter poor old(633,11)is now much behind her, yet(671,10)
was her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—(1413,10)where the
first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from(140,11)did those ab(138,8) whalem(1475,8)Red-Men, first sally out in canoes
to give chase to the Leviathan? And wher(131,20), too, did
that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with
imported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at(1491,10)s, in
order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
bowsprit?

Now having a night, a day(1420,8)ill another night(1137,11)before me
(1366,14), ere I could(1061,8)for my destined port, it became a
matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile(1481,10)
very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal(248,8)bitingly cold
and cheerless. I knew no one(2021,8)place. With anxious grapnels I had
sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,
wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood(1983,8)middle of
a dreary street shouldering my bag, and compar(1883,9)loom towards the
north(1298,8)e darkness(36,12) south—(186,9)in your wisdom you
may conclude to lodge(1698,9)night, my dear(242,10)be sure to
inquire the price, and don’t be too particular.

With halting steps I paced the streets, and pass(24,8)ign of “The
Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further
on,(911,9) bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came
such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and
ice from(972,8)the house, for everyw(1446,10)the congealed frost lay
ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,
when I struck my foot against the flinty projections(2020,10)from
hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most
miserable plight. T(464,22), again thought I, pausing one
moment to watch the broad glar(1087,9)stre(1041,8)hear(826,8)nds of
the tinkling glasses within. But go on(1039,18)at last; don’t
you hear? get away(498,17)door; your patched boots are
stopp(1038,8)way. So on I went. I now by instinc(1570,8)(855,14)
that took me waterward,(1010,8)re, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not
the cheeriest inns.

Such(1246,14)s! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,
and here and there a candle, lik(15,10) moving about in a tomb. At
this hour(966,8)night,(980,8)last day(996,8)week, that quarter(508,9)own proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light
proceeding from a low, wide building,(516,9) of which stood
inv(1812,8)open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant(1483,8)
use(1233,9)public; so, enter(127,9)first thing I did(2033,8)stumble

particles almost choked me, are these ashes(1434,8)at destroyed city,
Gomorrah? But “The (1554,16),” and “The (1471,10)?”—this, then
must needs be(1637,17) Trap.” However, I picked myself up and
hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior
door.

I(1589,10)he great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black
faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of
Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church;(957,8)

Moving on,(1496,10)(1002,11)dim sort of light not far(707,8)e
docks(1635,10)d a forlorn creaking(1679,8)air; and looking up, saw a
swinging sign over(1076,10)with a white painting upon it, faintly
representing a tall straight jet of misty spray(395,9)se words
underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”

Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion,(2007,8)
I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they s(182,8)I suppose this

spot for cheap lodging(969,11)best of pea coffee.

(1082,9)queer(835,9)place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied
as(1779,8), and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,
where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than
ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft.(84,11), nevertheless,
is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the
hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of(247,22)
calle(254,12),” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the
only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou
lookest out at it from a glass window (447,8)e frost is all(269,8)outside, or(93,13) observes(88,10)that sashle(94,9), where

feet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.


CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.

Entering that gable-ended(40,12), you found yourself in a wide,
low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large
oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent
study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry(281,8)neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades(1914,8)dow(115,8)at first
you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the tim(1295,9)New
England hags, had endeav(1090,8)delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint
of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
especially by throwing open the little window towards the bac(1851,8)
entry, you at last come(1501,8)conclusion that such an idea, however
wild, might not be altogether unwarranted(1842,12)most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,
portentous, black mas(889,9)thing hovering(451,8)cent(1293,8)e
picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a
nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy (105,8)truly, enough to drive
a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a(1331,9)indefinite,
half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to
it, till you involuntarily took an oath with(1349,10)to find out what
that marvellous (1227,9)meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,
deceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight
gale(39,11)unnatural combat(2015,8)four primal elements.—It’s a
blasted heat(116,8)a Hyperborean winter scen(110,12)breaking-up(1565,8)icebound stream of Time. But(882,9)all these fancies yielded to
that one (765,10)(750,11)in the(622,8)’s midst. _That_ once found
out, and(110,8) rest were plain. But stop; does i(973,8)ar a faint
resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?

In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,
partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with
whom I conver(72,13)subject. T(346,10) represents a Cape-Horner
in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its
three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,
purposing to spring clean(1259,8)e craft, is(1758,8)enormous act of
impaling(430,8)(347,10)three mast-heads.

The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with
glit(335,8)eeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots
of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped,(194,8)vast handle sweeping
round like the segment made(1675,8)new-mown grass by a long-armed
mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered(1863,8)(314,9)annibal
and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,
horrifying implement. Mix(319,8)these were rusty old whaling lances
and harpoons all broken and deformed(484,12)storied weapons. With
this once lo(92,8), now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan
Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that
harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away
with by a whale,(175,8)fterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The
original iron entered nigh the tail, and,(169,8)restless needle
sojourn(1605,11)body of a man, travelled full forty fee(1607,8)t last
was found imbedded(1685,8)hump.

Crossing this dusky entry, and on(2015,8) yon low-arched way—cut
(31,8)what in old times must have bee(1416,10)central chimney with
fireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier place
is this,(818,11)low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s
cockpits, especially of(966,9)owling night, when this corner-anchored
old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
table cover(1374,8)cracked glass cases, fill(1407,8)dusty rarities
gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting(50,8)e
further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude
attempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there(100,8)the
vast arched bon(140,9)(75,8)jaw, so wide, a coach might almost
drive(551,8) it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old
decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,
like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),
bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells
the sailors deliriums and death.

Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true
cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses
deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians
rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to
_this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_(19,8) more;
and so on to the full glass—(1699,9)Horn measure, which you may gulp
down for a shilling.

Up(1730,8)ing the place I found a number of young seamen (1073,9)about
a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I
sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with
a room, received for answer that his house was full—not a bed
unoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no
objections to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are
goin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”

I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should
ever do so, it would depend upon who the(226,11) might be, and that
if he ((484,12)) really had no oth(2039,8) for m(64,9)e
(93,11)was not decidedly (372,9)able, why rather than wander(1706,10)bout a strange town on so bitter a(1989,8)I would put up with
the half of any decent man(473,10).

“I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?
Supper’ll be ready directly.”

I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all o(504,8) a bench on the
Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still (2030,9)dorning it with
his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
between his legs. He was try(890,8)hand at a ship under full sail, but
he didn’t make much headway, (410,9).

At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—(1258,12) said
he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a
winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold
to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the
fare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but
dumplings; good heavens! (25,9) for supper! One young fellow in a
green box coat, addressed himself to these(87,11)in a most direful
manner.

“My boy,” said(1723,15)“you’ll have the nightmare to a dead
sartainty.”

“L(1784,8)” I whispered, “that aint(1380,16)is it?”

“Oh, no(139,8)he, looking a(1557,9)diabolically funny, “(1369,15)is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats(379,10), he
don’t—he eats n(692,11)steak(602,8)e likes ’em rare.”

“The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that(1859,11)? Is he here?”

“He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.

I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark
(287,12)”(2010,11). At any rate, I made up my mind(1885,9)it so
turned out that we should(1945,8)ogether, he must undress and get into
bed before I did.

Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the
evening as a looker on.

Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up,(873,13)
cried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing
this morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now
we(1011,13)latest news from the Feegees.”

A tramping of sea boots(257,11)in the entry; the door was flung
open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Envelop(261,9)ir
shaggy watch coa(1545,8)with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,
all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they
seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from
their boat(123,8)is(1029,9)first house they entered. No wonder, then,
that they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the
wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out
brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon
which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like po(368,8)gin and molasses, which he
swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never
mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of(518,9),
or on the weather side of an ice-island.

The liquor soon mounted into(742,12), as it generally does even
(786,8) arrantest topers newly(646,12) sea(762,9)y began
capering about most obstreperously.

I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof(873,8)ough
he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his
own sober face, yet up(369,8)hole he refrain(249,8)making as much
noise as(1564,9). This man interested me at once; and since the
sea-gods had ordained that h(1840,10)oon become my(202,9) (though
but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I
will here venture upon a(988,8)descri(1208,9)him. He stood full six
feet in height, with nobl(2046,8)ers(1649,8)chest like a coffer-dam. I
have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and
burnt,(435,8)his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the
deep shadows(587,8)eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem
to give him much joy. His voic(542,9) announc(515,11)was a
Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of
those tall mountainee(1658,8)the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When
the revelr(856,9)companions had(1146,9)to its(519,9)this man
slipped away un(1038,10)and I saw no more of him till he became my
comrade(1309,8)sea. In a few minutes(1119,11)he was missed(1022,8)(1039,9), and being, it seems, for(475,8)ason a huge favourite with
them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! (12,12)where’s
(32,10)?” and darted out of the house in pursuit(888,8)

It was now about nine o’clock(1435,9) room seeming almost
supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself
(1054,14)plan that had occurred to me just previous to the
entranc(1526,8) seamen.

No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but
people like to be private when they are(1402,9). And when it comes to
(1433,8) with an unknown stranger, in a(15,8) inn(18,15)town,
and that(56,9) a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely
multiply. Nor was there any earthly(752,8)why I as a sailor should
(396,18), more than anybody else; for sailors(982,9)sleep
(460,12) at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all(142,8)ogether in one apartment, but you have(511,10)hamm(809,8)
cover yourself(553,16)lanket, and sleep i(358,8)wn skin.

The more I pondered over this(421,16)(42,8)abominated the
(1467,8)of(1995,9) with him. It was fair to presume that being a
(525,12)his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
the tidiest, certainly non(941,9)finest.(1060,12)twitch all over.
Besides, it was getting late, and my decent(712,11) ought to be home
and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at
midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?

“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about(1279,8)(914,8).—I shan’t sleep
(462,11)’ll try the bench here.”

“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a
mattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling(1652,8)knots and
notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane
there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying
he procured the plane; and(804,8)s old silk handkerchief first dusting
(368,9), vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning
like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the
plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was
near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the
bed was soft enough to suit me(77,8)did no(1834,11)all(396,9)ing
in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the
(331,9)with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in
the middl(1204,9)room, he went about his busin(815,9)left me in a
brown study.

I now took the measur(1299,9)bench, and fou(1964,8)it was a foot too
short; b(1073,8)could be mended with a chair. Bu(68,20)narrow(271,8)e other bench(876,8)room was about four inches higher
than(845,10)d one—so there was no yok(362,8). I then placed the
first bench lengthwise along the only clear space(740,9)the wall,
leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I
soon(378,12)there came such a dra(1890,8)cold air over me from
under the sill(1772,8)window,(86,8)is plan(1846,8)ever do at all,
especially as(702,9)current from the rickety door met the one from
(119,12)and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds(770,8)immediate vicinity(1986,8)spot where I had th(1914,9)spend the
night.

The devil fetch(1771,16),(62,9)I, but stop, couldn’t I steal
a march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon
secon(248,9)s I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next
morning, so soon as I popped out(1149,14)the(310,11) might be
standing(1833,8)entry, all ready to knock me down!

Still, looking round me aga(1322,8)seeing no possible chance of
spending a sufferable night unless in som(1119,8)person’s bed, I began
to think that after all I(222,9) cherishing unwarrantable prejudices
(1048,10)is unknown(609,11). Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be
dropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps
we may become jolly good bedfellows(237,10)—there’s no telling.

But though(1444,12)oarders kept com(172,8)y ones, twos(1768,9)ees,
and going to bed, yet no sign of my(298,12)

“Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such
late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.

The landlord chuckled again with his lean(29,8)(681,9)med to be
mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he
answered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and (18,9)
rise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out
a peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,
unless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”

“C(24,18)?—W(508,14)bamboozingly story is this you are
telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,
(519,8)(1849,12)(1276,11)is actually engaged this blessed
Saturday night, or rather Sunday (1403,9)in(358,9)(269,9) around
this town?”

“That’s precisely it,” said t(698,11), “and I told him he(1741,9)
sell it here, the market’s overstocked.”

“With what?” shouted I.(25,8)heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads(1562,8)world?”

“I tell you what it is,(196,10)(1020,8) quite calmly, “you’d better
stop spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”

“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I
rayther guess you’ll be done _brown_ if that er(1840,13)hears you a
slanderin’(769,14)I’ll break it for him(269,9), now fly(720,11)passion again at
this unaccountable farrago(1998,8)(1251,8)’s.

“It’s broke a’ready(597,8)he.

“Broke(400,9)—“_broke_, do you mean?”

“Sart(1981,9)that’s the very reason(1020,15)it, I guess.”(1530,11)(241,11)going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a
snow-storm—“(958,10)stop(468,10). You and I must understand one
another(195,10) too without delay. I come to your house and want a
bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one;(1123,8)(1894,8)half

not yet seen, you persist in(2031,8) me the most mystifying and
exasperating stories tend(2003,9)get in me an uncomfortable feeling
towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a(2029,9)connexion(1428,12)which is an intimate and confidential one(1145,8)highest
degree. I now demand of you to speak out and(448,9)who and w(1546,8)
(1546,13), and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the
night with him. And(1323,8)first place, you will be so good as to unsay
that story about sel(1617,13)(307,9)f true I take to be good
evidence(1776,25)stark mad, and I’ve no idea of
sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean(1518,11) _you_,
sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render
yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”

“Wall(1862,22)fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long
sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be
easy, this h(1595,15)I have bee(948,8)’ you of has just arrived
from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand

he was goin’ out(1880,8)door with four heads strung on a string, for
all the airth like(33,9) of inions.”

This account cleared up(1584,10)wise(2033,15)mystery, and showed
(1637,9)(1821,10)after all, had had(978,11) fooling me—but at the
same time what could I think of a(1079,12)who stayed(296,8)a
Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
business as(1262,9)the heads of dead idolators?

“Depend upon it(1151,12)that(1263,15)a dangerous man.”

“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful
late, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me
slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room
for two to kick abou(88,10)bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,
afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and(1296,8)Johnny in the
foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and
somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near break(1838,8)arm.
Arter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a
glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards
me, offering to lead the way(298,8)stood irresolute; when looking at a
clock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it(1411,9)—you won’t see that
(1688,11)(1476,8); he’s come to anchor somewhere—c(299,10)then;
_do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”

I considered the matter a moment,(1862,9) up stairs we w(28,9)I was
ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four(302,11)s to sleep abreast.

“There,” said(1439,15)plac(1239,8)candle on a crazy old sea chest
that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make
yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from
eye(1419,8)bed, but he had disappeared.

Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over(79,8). Though none of
the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then
glanc(196,9)the room; and besides(206,8)stea(326,18),
could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,
the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a
whale. Of things not properly(142,18)room, there was a
hammock lashed up(879,8)rown up(1355,12) in on(1103,8); also a
large seaman’s bag, contain(1960,9)(1902,9)’s wardrobe, no doubt in
lieu of a land trunk. Likewise(181,13) parcel of outlandish bone
fish hooks(1541,8)shelf(600,10)fire-place(371,8)tall(161,8)
standing at the head of(659,9)

But what is thi(104,9)chest? I took(1815,8)(1506,12)close to the
l(1734,9) felt it, and sm(14,12)tried every way possible to
arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it
to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented(276,8)edges with little
tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an
Indian moccasin. T(496,11)hole or slit(1748,8)middle of this mat, as
you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be(351,9)
that any sober(702,11) would get(1639,8)(297,10)and parade the
streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to
try(539,9)it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy
and thick(1839,8)thought a little damp, as though this mysterious(1752,11) had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit
of glass stuck against the wall(1999,8)never saw such a sight in my
life. I tore myself out of it in(52,8)hurry that I gav(45,9)a kink
in the neck.

I sat down(1081,9)ide(1019,11), and commenced thinking about this
head-peddling(1269,11), and his(856,9). After(70,10)some time on
the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacke(1074,8)hen stood in
(808,16)e room(187,9)(1814,8)(85,13)co(717,8)(550,9)
little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,
half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about
(1615,17)not coming home at all that night, it being so very
late, I made no more ado, but jumped(597,8)my pantaloons and boots,
(368,9)blowing out the light tumbled into(577,16)ded myself
to the care of heaven.

Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal(744,8)uld not
sleep for a long time. At last I slid off(1298,8)light doze, and had
pretty nearly made(115,8)offing towards(502,9) of Nod, when I heard
a heavy footfall(1548,8)passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into
(776,9)from under the door.

Lord save me, thinks I, that must be (646,14), the infernal(1031,11)er. But I lay perfectly sti(1262,8)resolved not to say a word
till spoken to. Holding(356,9)in one hand(1022,8)at identical New
Zealand head(1851,8)oth(180,8)stranger entered(1061,9), and without
look(423,16)bed, placed his candl(472,9)way off from (1238,10)floor(185,8)corn(1309,8)then began working away at the knotted
cords(1430,8)large bag I before spoke of as being(547,8)room. I was
all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for(1446,10)
while employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,
he turned round—when, good heavens! what(1797,8)! Such a face! It was
of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here(1572,8)re stuck over with
large blackish (498,8)squares. Yes, it’s just as I(1570,8), he’s a
terrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here
he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his
face so(1117,14)ight, that I plainly saw they(1272,10) be
sticking-plasters at all, those black(290,8) on his cheeks. They were
stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;
but soon an inkling(2007,8)truth occurred to me. I(1878,9)ed a story
of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had
been tattooed by them. I concluded that this(1319,13)in the course
of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And
what is it,(655,8) I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be
honest in any sort of skin. But then,(407,17)his unearthly
complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round abo(759,8)completely
independent(1256,8)(610,9)f tattooing. To be sure, it might be
nothing b(2008,10)coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot
sun’s(42,8)(564,12)(2025,8)(1130,8)(1129,8)one. However, I had
never(1023,9)the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these
extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were
passing through me like lightning,(689,16) never noticed me at
all. But(613,8)some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced
fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a(653,9)tomahawk, and a
seal-skin wall(808,8)the hair on. P(1681,10)se on the old chest in
the middle(1876,8)room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly
thing enough—and crammed it down into(1813,8). He now took off his
hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.
There was no(262,8) his head—none to speak of at least—(818,13)
small scalp-knot twisted up(1508,8)forehead. His bald(781,10)head now
looked for(655,8) world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger
stood between m(1985,9) door, I would have bolted out of it quicker
than ever I(37,8)a dinner.

Even as it was,(2007,10) something of slipp(383,8)of the window, but
it was the second floor back. I am no coward, bu(1766,22)
head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.
Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being(1397,11) nonplussed and
confounded abou(404,14), I confess I was now as much afraid of
him as if (283,11)devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
the dead of night. In fact, I was so(118,10) him that(155,9)t game
enough just(987,8) address him, and demand a satisfactory answer
concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.

Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed
his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts(260,8)were
checkered(1309,10)sam(1873,10)as his face; his back, too, was all
over(58,10)dark(1936,8); he(262,8)to have(1770,9)a Thirty Years’
W(635,8)just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still
more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs
were running up the trunks of young palms. It(732,9)quite plain that
he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman
in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to
think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own
brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that(1947,9)!

But t(1671,12)time for shuddering, for now th(305,9)went about
(1399,10)that(1191,12)fascinated my attention, and convinced me
that (423,8)indeed be a heathen. Going to(1825,8)vy grego, or wrapall,
or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in
the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image
with a hunch on it(944,8)and exactly the colour of a three days’ old
Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost(1817,8)
that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar
manner. But see(493,9)i(886,8)t at all limber, and(35,9)glistened
a good deal like polished ebony, I conclude(63,10)(956,8)nothing
but a wooden idol(488,8)indeed it proved to be. F(704,17)
goes up to the empty fire-place, and remov(366,8)papered fire-board,
sets up thi(519,9)hunch-back(523,8), like a tenpin, between the
andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,
so(1863,8)thought this(210,11) made a very appropriate(702,8)shrine
or chapel for his Congo idol.

I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden(259,8)feeling but
ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes
about a double handful of shavings out(1333,8)grego pocket, and places
them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on
top and apply(926,8)flame from the lamp, he kindled the(171,10)into
a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the
fire, and still hastier withdrawal(1608,9)fingers (whereby he seemed
to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the
biscuit; then blowing off(1747,8)t and ashes a little, h(682,9)polite
offer of it(942,8)little negro. But(22,12)devil did not seem to
fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these
strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from
the devotee, who seem(1200,8) praying in a sing-song or else singing
some pagan psalmody or other, during(1793,8)is face twitched about(1771,8)most unnatural (1517,8)At last extinguis(525,8) fire, he took the
idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in(922,17)
as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.

(427,9) queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing
him now exhibiting strong symptoms of(1707,8)ing his business
operations, and jumping into bed with me,(1455,11)it was high time,
now or never,(1178,12)light was put out, to break the spell in which
I had so long been bound.

(827,8)interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
Taking up his tomahawk(1276,10)table, he examined(1028,8)d of it for
an instant, and then holding(1021,13)ght, with his mouth at the
handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment
(356,14)(766,10)ed(153,8)is wild cannibal,(245,10)between
his teeth, spra(510,19). I sang out, I could not help it
now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began(1900,9)me.

Stammer(1435,8)something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
against the wall(415,11)conjured him, whoever or whatever he might
be, to keep qui(1928,8)let me get up and light(1844,9) again. But his
(1360,9)responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my
meaning.

“Who-e debel you?”—(1764,12)aid—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.”
And so say(1318,8)lighted(540,12)gan flourishing about me in the
dark.

“Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. (53,9)! Watch!
Coffin! Angels! save me!”

“Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or(228,17)!” again growled the
(770,10)while his horrid(232,12)s of the(1052,10)scattered the
hot(917,9)ashes(281,10)till(1319,11)my linen would get on fire.
But thank heaven, at tha(985,8) the landlord came into the room light
in hand(671,8)aping(1228,10)bed I ran up to him.

“Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t
harm a hair of your head.”

“Stop your(79,9),(513,11), “and why didn’t you tell me that that
infernal harpooneer was a(1230,9)?”

“(1690,10)ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads
around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. (279,8), look
here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you(48,11)?”

“Me(62,8)plenty”—grunted(109,11)puffing away at his pipe and
sitting up in bed.

“You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me(1705,10)(1816,8), and
throw(1066,8)clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a
civil but a(42,8)kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a
moment. For all his tattooings(477,8)on the whole a clean, comely
(84,8)(1806,8). What’s all this fuss I have been mak(1279,9),
(989,8)I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just
as much reason to fear me, a(126,9)to(933,11)of him. Better sleep
with a sober(2017,9) than a drunken Christian(1453,13)” said I, “tell him to stas(515,14) there, or pipe, or
(1842,9)you call it; (72,14)op smoking, in short, and I will
turn in(629,8)m. But I don’t fancy having a man(79,8) in bed with
me. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”

This being told to(968,11)h(1939,10)complied, and again politely
motioned me to get into bed—rolling over(804,12) (499,8)as to
say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”

“Good night,(1546,9)(439,12)you may go.”

I turned in, and never slept better in my life.


CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.

Upon waking next morn(775,9) daylight, I foun(1185,10)’s arm thrown
over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost(881,11)had been his wife. The c(185,10) was of patchwork, full of
odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his
tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no
two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his
keeping (163,8)at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt
sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same(274,11), I
say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same(421,10)
quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I
could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues
together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that(133,9)tell that(1977,9) was hugging me.

My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a
child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
whether(245,8)a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The
(101,13)was this.(956,12)cutting up some caper or other—I
think(382,8)trying to crawl up the chimney(1837,9)d seen a little
sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow(140,9),
was(718,9)time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my
mother dragged me(587,8)legs out of(210,12) and packed me off to
bed, though(663,13)two o’clock(1378,8)afternoon(89,8)21st June,
the longest day(1429,8)year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But
there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my(1401,8)room in the
third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,
and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.

I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small
of my back ached to think of it. A(1163,10)so light too; the sun
shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches(394,8)streets, and the sound of gay voices(1777,10)the hous(545,10)worse
and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my
stockinged feet, sought out(942,14), and suddenly threw(568,9)t
her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemn(1037,9)
lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But sh(1330,8)e best and
most conscientious of(1210,11)s, and back I had to go to my room. For
several hours (772,12)broad awake, feeling(566,9)deal worse than
I have ever done since, even(1898,10)greatest subsequent misfortunes.
A(546,9)must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and
slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eye(748,10)(968,8)sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt
a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and
(28,18)heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.
My arm hung(946,10)counterpane(1000,10)nameless, unimaginable,
silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged,(141,8)closely
seated by my bed-side. For what(188,8)ages piled on ages,(669,12),
frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet
ever think(1506,9)if(1469,9)but stir it one single inch, the horrid
spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness (1298,8)glided
away from me; but(710,8)in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it
all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost(1891,8)in
confounding attempts to expla(141,8)ystery. Nay, to this very hour, I
often puzzle(1985,8)with it.

Now, take away the(449,11), and my sensations at(1160,9)the
(761,18)in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to
those which I experienced on(1093,8)up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm
thrown round (1466,8)at(1489,8)all the past night’s events soberly
recurred, one by one, in fixed reality(1934,9)n I lay only alive to
the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his
bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,
as(115,8)naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse
him—“(374,8)!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my
neck(1738,10)s if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a
slight scratch. Throwing aside(1361,18)there(1876,8) tomahawk
(328,9)by the savage’s side,(155,15)a hatchet-faced baby. A
pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed h(222,9)strange house in the
broad day, with a cannibal and a(180,9)! (386,10)—in(1575,9) of
goodness,(795,9), wake!” A(770,8), by dint of much wriggling, and
loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in
extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back(830,8), shook himself
all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in
bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if
he did not altogether(1588,9) how I came to be there(586,8) a dim
(1719,14)of knowing something about me(2034,8)slowly dawning over
him. Meanwhile(2003,8)quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings
now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at
last, his mind(183,8)made up touching the character of his bedfellow,
and he became, as(1109,8), reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon
the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,
if it pleased me, he would dress first(1603,10)le(77,10)dress
afterwards, leav(259,8)whole apartment to myself. Thinks I(1024,11)
under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the
truth is, thes(1320,8)s have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you
will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this
particular compli(260,8)(1266,10)because he treated me with so much
civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;
staring at him(1087,10)bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for
the time my curiosity gett(755,8)better of my breeding. Nevertheless,
a man like(1531,9) you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well
worth unusual regarding.

He commenced dressing at top by donn(1267,8)beaver hat,(606,8)tall
one,(1898,8)by,(765,9)—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his
boots. What (730,10)heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his
next movement was to crush(1588,8)—boots in hand, and hat on—(847,9)
bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he
was hard at work booting(1727,8);(1535,8)by no law of propriety that I
ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on(349,12)But(846,11)do you see, wa(1474,12) in the transition
stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough(1153,10)
to show off his outlandishness(119,8)strangest possible manners. His
education was not yet completed(132,9)an undergraduate. If he had not
been a small degree(1325,10), he very probably would not have troubled
himself with boots at all; but then, i(123,12) been still a savage,
he never would have dreamt of(1082,9)(1527,10)bed to put them on. A(1909,9)e emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over
his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not
being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide
ones—(385,9)not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him
at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.

Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window(1272,8)at the
street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
into(349,12)nd observing more and more the indecorous figure that
(1593,9)made, stav(443,10)with little else(1358,8) hat and boots on;
I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate(1820,11) somewhat, and(2027,11)ly to get into his pantaloons as soon as(1034,9). He
compli(1936,8)then proceeded to wa(1522,10). At that tim(1242,8)
morning any Christian(888,12)washed his face; b(1340,13)to my
amazement, cont(623,9)(1038,10)restrict(1857,8)ablutions to his
chest, arms(1678,8)nds. He then donne(2002,8)istcoat, and taking up a
piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water
and commenced lather(2044,8)face. I was watching to see where he kept
his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from(1237,8)
corner, slips (1120,8)long wooden stock, unsheath(77,8)ead, whets it
a(727,8)on his boot,(1974,8)iding up(963,8)bit of mirror against the
wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather(207,8)ing of his cheeks.
Thinks I,(582,12)his is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a
vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came
to know of what fine steel(322,9) of a(409,9)is made, and how
exceedingly sharp(413,10)straight edges are always kept.

The rest(285,8)toilet w(1001,9)chiev(985,8)he proudly marched out of
(1647,10)wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacke(507,8)por(911,8)
(638,8)like a marshal’s baton.


CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.

I quickly followed suit, and descending (1472,9)bar-room accosted the
grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,
though he had been skylarking with me not (786,9)in the matter of my
bedfellow.

However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and(769,8)too scarce a
(36,10); the more’s the pity. So, if any one man,(455,8)own proper
person, afford stuff for(157,8)joke to anybody, let him not be
backward, but(29,9)cheerfully allow(1465,9)to spend and be spent in
that way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about
him, be sure there is more in that(85,8)n you perhaps think for.

T(592,12)was now full of the boarders who(532,10)dropping(1796,8)night previous, and whom I had not as yet had(521,9)ook at. They were
nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second(18,12)thir(17,8)
and sea carpenter(55,9)a coop(17,13)blacksmiths, and(968,8)e(55,10)hip keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky
beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing(1114,14)s for morning
gowns.

You could pretty plainly tell how long each on(957,11)ashore. This
young fellow’s healthy cheek is(1211,8)sun-toasted pear in hue, and
would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days
landed from his Indian voyage. T(698,8)next him looks a few shades
lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the
complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly
bleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks(400,9)But who
could show a cheek like(2009,9)? which, barred with various tints,
seemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array,
contrasting climates, zone by zone.

“Grub, ho!” now cried the(1650,9), flinging open a door, and in we
went to b(1792,11)They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease
in manner, quite self-possessed in(938,8). Not always, though:
Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch
one; of all men, they (133,10)the least assuranc(1857,9)parlor. But
(1451,10)e mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as(206,8) did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in
the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s
performances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode
of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort
of thing is to be had anywhere.

These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some
good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man
maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked
embarrassed. Yes, her(222,8) set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire
strangers to them—and duelled them dead(123,9)winking; and yet, here
they sat at a(588,8)(1173,9) table—all of the same calling, all of
kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green
Mountains. A curious sight; these(369,8) bears, these timid warrior
whalemen!

But as for(1669,9)—why,(1683,9) sat there(140,10)m—at the head of
(747,11)too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I
cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have
cordially justified his bringing his harpoon in(1691,12) with him,
and using i(251,8)(732,8)ceremony; reaching ove(1392,8)ble with it,
to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks
towards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and
every one knows that in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly
is to do it genteelly.

We will not speak(1809,8)(592,8)’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
coffee and hot rolls, and appl(458,8)undivided attention to
(307,10), done rare. Enough, that when(496,12)as over he withdrew
like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was
sitting there quietly digesting and smoking(632,8)s inseparable hat
on, when I sallied out for a stroll.


CHAPTER 6. The Street.

If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
an individual as(1048,10)circulating(1190,11)polite society of a
civilized town, that(145,9)ment soon departed upon taking my first
daylight stroll thr(1364,8) streets of New Bedford.

In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
frequently offer to view the queerest (1546,8)nondescripts from foreign
parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut(197,8), Mediterranean mariners
will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not
unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live
Yankees have often scared the natives. But(399,12) beats all Water
Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only
sailors; but in(507,12), actual cannibals stand chatting a(369,8)
corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy
flesh. It makes a stranger stare.

But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
and Brighggians, and(89,14)wild specimens of the whaling-craft
which unheeded reel about(852,12), you will see other sights still
more curious,(1685,11)more comical. There weekly arrive in this town
scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain
and glory(704,8)fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;
fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and
snatch(373,9)e-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence
they came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old.
Look there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat
and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.
Here comes another(56,9)ou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.

No town-bred dandy will compare(131,8)country-bred one—I mean a
downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that(1277,9)dog-days, will mow his
two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the
comical(603,8)he does upon reaching th(1822,9). In bespeaking his
sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; strap(26,8)
canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those
straps(1020,10)rst howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,
buttons, and all, down the throat(1355,8)tempest.

But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers,(1693,10),
and(657,8)s to show her visitors. Not at all. Still(1885,13)is a
queer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would
this day perhaps have been in as(338,9)conditio(1222,9)coast of
Labrador. As it is, parts of her back(935,8) are enough to frighten
one, they look so bony. The town itself is(170,9)the dearest place to
live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, tru(146,8): but not
like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. T(1859,10) do not run
with milk; nor(1700,8)spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.
Yet, in spite of this, nowhere(230,8)America will you find more
patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New
Bedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of
(1452,9)?

Go and gaze(57,8)e iron emblematical(836,8)s round yonder lofty
mans(1289,9)your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave
houses and flowery(270,9)came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian
oceans. One(1100,10)they were(1032,9)d and dragged up hither(102,9)
bottom(1142,8)sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat(1611,8)at?

In(1064,12), fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
daughters, and portion off their nieces(2048,8)few porpoises a-piece.
You must go to(1213,13)to see a brilliant wedding; for(172,11)
they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly
burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.

In summer time, t(1150,9)s sweet to see; full of fine maples—long
avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful
and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by
their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is
art; which in many a district of(1692,13)has superinduced bright
terraces of flowers(1016,10)barren refuse rocks thrown aside at
creation’s final day.

And the women(141,15), they bloom(808,8)eir own red roses. But
roses onl(47,8)i(522,8); whereas the fine carnation o(790,8)cheeks
is perennial as sunlight(1533,9)eventh heavens. Elsewhere match that
blo(1031,9)irs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young
girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off
shore, as though(1243,11)drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of
the Puritanic sands.


CHAPTER 7. The Chapel.

In this same(1090,14)here stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and few are
the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or(1516,10)who
fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.

Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out(1886,10)
special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving
sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket(1691,8)cloth called
bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found
a small scattered(1184,10)ion of sailo(1690,8)sailors’ wives and
widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks
(1920,8)torm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart
(2004,8) other, as if e(76,11)grief were insular and
incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; an(787,8)these
silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble
tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the
pulpit. Three of them ran something(1433,9) following, but I do not
pretend to quote:—

SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was
lost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, _November_
1_st_, 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.(207,26)ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,
WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming on(405,8) boats’
crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by(1414,8), On the
Off-shore Ground(1792,8)PACIFIC, _December_ 3(319,10)9. THIS MARBLE
Is here placed by(1721,8)urviving SHIPMATES(324,27)The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who(1951,8)bows
of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, _August_
3_d_, 1833(533,46)WIDOW.

Shaking off the sleet(1593,9)ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated
myself n(726,8)door, and (1671,8)sideways was surprised to see
Queequeg near me. Affect(396,9) solemnity(1562,8)scene, there was a
wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage
was the only person present who(1426,8)to notice my entrance; because
he (73,13)one who could not read, and, therefore, was(30,9)ing
those frigid inscriptions(536,8)wall. Whether an(291,9)relatives of
the seamen whose names appeare(1497,8)were now among the(1820,13),
I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents(916,8)fishery,
and so plainly did(1557,9)wome(366,11)(1319,8)(428,11) if not
the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here
before me were assembled those, i(299,8)unhealing hearts the sight of
those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed
afresh.

Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing
among flowers can say—here, _here_ lies my beloved; ye know not the
d(1678,9) that broods in bosoms(1867,9)se. What bitter blanks in(278,9)ack-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair(67,10)immovable(765,13)(46,9)adly voids and unbidden
infidelitie(641,9)lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse
resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a
grave. As well might those(560,10)ta(1724,10)cave of Elephanta as
here.

In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;
why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no
tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is
that(1695,8)name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix
so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if
he but embarks(117,9)remotest Indies of this(380,8)earth; why the
Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what
eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies
antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago(410,11) that we
still refuse to be comfo(407,11)ose who we nevertheless maintain are
dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the(724,8)so strive to hush all
(735,8); w(1846,8) but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify
a whole city. All these things are not(967,9)their meanings.

But(1072,8)like a jackal, feeds(1858,11)tombs, and even from these
dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.

It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
Nantucket voyage, I regard(1783,8) marbl(1178,9), and by the murky
light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who
had gone (1926,9). Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But
somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine
chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat will make me an
(951,8) by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling—a
speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what
then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.
(64,9)that w(1527,9)call my shadow here on earth is my true
substance.(139,10)that in looking at(869,8)spiritual, we are too
much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking
that thick water the thinnest of air(163,11)my body is(1099,9)lees
of my better being. In fact take(57,9)who will, take it I say, it is
not me. And t(1206,9)three cheers for (927,9); and come(640,13)
and(655,9)dy when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.


CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.

I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him b(1597,10)congregation,
sufficiently attested (543,8)s fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it
(26,8)famous Father Mapple, so calle(1322,9)(1259,8), among whom he
was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in
his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the
ministry. At the time I now write of,(228,14) was in the hardy
winter of a healthy old age; that sort of(22,8) which seems merging
into a second flowering(224,8)for among(478,9)fissures of his
wrinkl(1395,10)shone(664,9)mild gleams of a newly developing
bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’s snow. No
one having previously heard his history, could for the first time
behold(375,16)ithout the utmost interest, because there were
(913,8)engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that
adventurous maritime life he had led. When he(1000,8) I observed that
he carried no umbrella, and(1081,8)ly(1136,9)come in his carriage, for
his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot
cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of
(1646,9) it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one
by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;
when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the p(1518,8)Like most old fashioned pulpits, it (1203,11)lofty one, and since a
regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle(354,9)
floor, seriously contract the already small area of(1448,9)el, the
architect, i(484,8), had acted upon the hint of(1476,16)and
finis(294,14)(898,9)a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side
ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife
of a whaling captain had provided(262,11) with a handsome pair of
red worsted man-ropes for this (172,8)which, being itself nicely
head(679,8)stained(110,8)mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,
considering what manner of(191,8)it was,(926,8)by no means in bad
taste. Halting for an instant at the foot(543,8)(391,8)and with both
hands grasping the ornamental knobs(608,8)(303,9)(1806,15)
cast a look upwards, and then(394,8)truly sailor-like but still
reverential dexterity, h(1073,8) hand, mounted the steps as if
ascend(191,8)main-top of his vessel.

The(671,15)parts of this sid(294,11)s is usually the case
with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the round(1269,8)f
wood, so that at every step(1729,8)as a joint. At my first glimpse(1410,8)pulpit,(1412,8)not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,
these joints in the present instance(1575,8)unnecessary. For I was not
prepared to see(1979,15)after gain(615,8)height, slowly turn
roun(859,9)ooping over(1449,11), deliberately drag up(738,11)
step by step, till(904,11)was deposited within, leaving him
impregnabl(1922,9)little Quebec.

I pondered some time(1307,9)fully compreh(664,11)reason(1131,9).
(289,14)enjoyed(1582,8)wide reputation for sincerity and
sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any
mere trick(998,9)stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober
(214,15) thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.
Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies
his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties
and connexions? Yes, for replenish(1522,8)the meat and wine of the
word, to the faithful man of God, this(956,9)I see, is a
self-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein,(1773,8)perennial
well of water within the walls.

But the(1268,12)(969,8) the only strange featur(221,8) place,
borrowed from(1915,9)lain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble
cenotaphs on either hand(107,9)ulpit,(187,9) which formed its back
was ador(1931,11)large painting representing a gallant ship beating
against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there
floated a(1146,8)isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s
face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
ship’s tossed deck,(958,11)like that silver plate now inserted into
the Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel
seemed to say, “beat on, (9,9)thou(62,12) and bear a hardy
helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling
off—serenest azure is at hand.”

Nor was(1714,11) itself(1569,9)a trac(847,9)same sea-taste that
had achieved(1755,11) and the picture. Its panelled front wa(1990,8)
likeness of a ship’s bluff bows,(80,9)Holy Bible rested on a
projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after(101,10)fiddle-headed
beak.

What could be more full of meaning?—(1449,8)(315,8)s ever this earth’s
foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear;(394,12)leads(1442,8)ld. From thence it is th(1015,10) God’s quick wrath is first
descried(325,10)bow(1826,8)ar the earliest brunt(110,19)
the God of breezes fair or foul(111,9) invoked for favourable winds.
Yes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;
(607,9)(381,9)its prow.


CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.

Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
the scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away
to larboard—(9,8)(47,8) to s(68,8)! Midships! m(10,8)”

There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a
still slighter shuff(69,8)women’s sho(49,9)ll was quiet again, and
every eye on the preacher.

He paus(1577,11); then kneeling in(1863,11)’s bows, folded his
large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and
offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed(157,10)and praying
at the bottom(1306,9)ea.

This ended, in prolonged solemn tones,(1675,8)e continual tol(440,8)a
bell in(794,8)that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he
commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards
the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—


  “The ribs and terror(1533,8) whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,
  While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down
  to doom.

  “I saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there;
  Which none but they that feel can tell— Oh, I was plunging to
  despair.

  “In black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him
  mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints— No more(394,10) did me
  confine.

  “With speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne;
  Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God.

  “My song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I
  give the glory to(346,9)His(1960,9)mercy(1846,9)power.”




Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
how(1454,8)(1996,9). A brief pause ensued;(1361,13) slowly turned
over the leaves(1172,8)Bible, and at last, fold(1005,8)hand down upon
the proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the
first chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up
Jonah.’”

“S(123,10)this book, containing only four(120,8)s—four yarns—is one
(1451,8)mallest strand(1157,9)mighty cabl(204,8) Scriptures. Yet what
depth(358,9)soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant
lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in
the fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the
floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy(1792,14)
waters; sea-weed and(838,9)slim(339,9)sea is about us! But _what_
(265,8)(286,8)h(1900,9)ok(586,9) teaches? (535,11)it is a
two-stranded lesson; a(81,9)o us all as sinful men, and(38,12)
me as a pilot(2020,8)living God. A(64,14)it is(104,15)
all, because(34,9)story(1009,9)in, hard-heartedness, suddenly
awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally
the deliverance(1945,8)(924,9). As with all sinners among men, the
sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedienc(1048,9)command of God—never mind now what that (40,8)was, or how
conveyed—which he found a hard(51,8). But(1468,9)things that God
would have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he
oftener(163,8)s us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we
must disobey ourselves; and it is in this(37,8)ing(40,10), wherein
the hardness of (43,8)God consists.

“With this sin of(415,14)in him, Jonah still further flouts at
God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men
will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the
Captains(653,9)earth. He skulk(1115,8)the wharves of Joppa, and seeks
a ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto
unheeded meaning here. By all accounts(82,9) c(642,10)been no
other city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of learned men.
And where is Cadiz,(1966,10)? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from
(292,8)s Jona(176,8)possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when
the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because(411,8)(251,10)
Jaffa(196,11), is o(286,8)st easterly coas(1441,9)Mediterranean,
the Syrian; and(392,10)or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not
then(209,13)that(883,8)ought(850,9)world-wide from God?
Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with
slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the
shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross(2036,8)s. So
disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen
(638,9)days, Jonah,(545,9)ere suspicion of something wrong, had
been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no
baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany him
to(1200,9)f with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he
finds the(1140,10)ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as
he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin,(1908,9)sailors for
the moment desist from hoisting(66,8)goods, to mark the stranger’s
evil eye.(1695,8)ees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and
confidence;(50,9)essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitio(1643,8)e
man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but
still serious way, one whisper(1143,8) other—“Jack, he’s robbed a
widow;” or, “Joe, do you mark him;(684,8)bigamist(45,8)Harry lad, I
guess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,
one(1406,8)missing murderers from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill
that’s stuck against the spile upon(802,11)to which the ship is
moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a
parricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and
looks from Jonah(466,8)bill; while all his sympathetic(1970,10) now
crowd round(1248,8)prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah
trembles, and summoning(130,9)boldness to his face, only looks so
much the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that
itself is strong(1446,10). So he makes the best of it; and when the
(1123,9)ind him not to b(917,8)n that is advertised, they let him
pass, and he descends into(1237,10).

“‘Who’s there?’ cries the(1286,9)at his busy desk, hurriedly making
out his paper(637,10)Customs—(99,15)Oh! how(1792,8)rmless
question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.
But he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to(1607,9); how soon
sail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy(1570,9)had not looked up to Jonah,
though(433,9)now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that
hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail(1893,9)
next coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing
him. ‘N(172,8), sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest(681,10)goes a
passenger.’ Ha!(1013,8)that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away
(669,12)from that scent. ‘I’ll(255,11)ye,’—he says,—‘the(521,8)
money how much is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written,
(1236,9), as if it were a thing(957,11)overlooked(646,9)history,
‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with
the context, this is full of meaning.

“Now Jonah’s(1002,8),(1439,10), was one whose discernment detects
crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In
this world(127,13)sin that pays its way can travel freely, and
without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all
frontiers. So(281,16)(1686,8)s to test the length of(328,8)
purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;
and it’s assented to. Then(1430,13)knows that Jonah is a fugitive;
but at the same time resolves to help a flight(364,8)ves its rear with
gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes (1533,9)urse, prudent(1784,10)s
still mol(315,8)Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.
Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and(269,10)put down for his
passage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m
travel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like it(74,8)(1868,11),
‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock
contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there,(2008,12)
laughs lowly to himself, and(340,8) something about(143,9)s of
convicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed
and dusty as he is, Jonah throws(152,8) into his berth, and finds the
little(462,11) ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is
close,(584,11)gasps. Then, (1171,8)contracted hole, sunk, too,
beneath the ship’s water-line(217,8)feels the heralding presentiment
of that stifling hour, w(1029,8)whale shall hold him(1375,8)smallest of
his bowels’ wards.

“Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
oscillates in(1603,9)room; and(250,9), heeling over towards the
wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and
all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity
with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight
itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it
hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in(779,10) his
tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful
(1596,8) finds no refuge(1345,8) restless glance. But that
contradiction(2024,8)lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the
ceiling(164,8)(647,9)re all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in
me!’ he groans, ‘(422,8) upwards, so it burns;(1362,9)chambers of my
soul(121,9)in crookedness!’

“Like one who after a n(708,8)drunken revelry hies (1210,9)d, still
reeling, but with(210,12)yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags(1361,8)m;
as(208,9)(1253,8)miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy
anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at
last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over(299,8)
over the man who bleeds to death, for(579,12)is the wound, and
(1960,8)naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings(921,13),
(1311,8)prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.

“And now the time of tide has come;(1650,9) casts off her cables; and
from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,
glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded
smugglers! the contraband was Jonah(1117,8)e sea rebels; he will not
bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on,(291,10)is like to
break. But now(1891,10)boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when
boxes, bales, and jars are clatter(1802,8)board;(1996,11)ind is
shriek(1283,13)men are yel(1308,10)every plank thunders with
trampling feet right over(1958,9)head; in all this raging tumult,
Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and(72,8)sea,
feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far
rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving
the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into(1671,9)s
of(864,9)—a berth(1767,8)cabin as I have taken it, (721,8)fast
asleep(727,10)(2011,8)ed master com(1578,8)m, and shriek(1108,9)dead
ear, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled from his lethargy
by that direful cry(266,8)stagger(1718,9)feet, and stumbling to the
deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon(969,8). But at that moment he
is sprung upon by a panther billow leap(835,8) the bulwarks. Wave
after wave thus leaps(455,11)hip, and finding no speedy vent runs
roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to(1462,10)while yet
afloat. And ever(1984,9)white moon shows her affrighted face (1447,8)
steep gullies(624,8)blackness overhead, aghast(447,8)ees the rearing
bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the
tormented deep.

“Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his
cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The
sailors mark him; m(444,8)more certain grow their suspicions of him,
and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to
high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this
great tempest wa(349,8)hem. The lot is(1491,8);(966,8)scovered, then
how furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine
occupation? Whence com(1134,8)? Thy country? What people? But mark now,
my(1386,12)the behavior of poor(2032,8)The eager(871,10)but ask
him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer
to those(248,10), but likewise another answer to a(292,9) not put
by them, but the unsolicited(58,8)is forc(1402,8)Jonah by the hard
hand of God that is upon him.

“‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord(827,8) of Heaven
who hath made(1413,8) and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well
might(1641,8)(116,15)God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to
make a full confession; where(1574,9)(509,10)ecame(975,14)
appalle(1206,8)till are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating
God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his
deserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him
forth(1698,11)ea, for he(124,8)at for _his_ sake this (1059,13)
(1059,13); they mercifully turn(2047,8)m, and seek by other means
to save(1836,9). But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;
then, with one hand raised invokingly to God,(1159,9) other(956,9)
unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.

“And now behol(378,8)taken up as an anchor and dropped(363,13);
when instantly an oily calmness floats out(1937,9) east,(832,9)sea
is still, as(515,8)arries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water
behind. He go(61,8)in the whirling heart of such a masterless
commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into
the yawning jaws awaiting him;(1081,9)whale shoots-to(2000,8) ivory
teeth, like so many white bolts,(1256,8)s prison. T(945,9) prayed
u(790,8)Lord out of the fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and
learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as(1619,8)Jonah does not weep and
wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is
just. He leaves(304,9)(78,11)(791,9)conten(372,8)self with
this, that spite of(376,9)pains and pangs, he will still look towards
His holy temple. And here,(1961,12)is true and faithful repentance;
not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for(268,11). And how pleasing
to God was this conduct i(1474,9)is sh(782,11)eventual(396,12)
of him(937,10)(1767,12)whale. S(222,10)I do not place Jonah
before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him (55,11)as a
model for(303,11). Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it
like Jonah.”

While he was speaking these words, the howling(813,8)shrieking,
slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
when describing Jonah’s sea-storm,(81,10)ssed by a storm(717,8).
His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his(77,8)arms seemed
the warring elements at work(1192,10)thunders that rolled away from
off his swarthy brow(1502,10)light leaping(1858,8)s eye, made(1270,8)
simple hearers look on him(211,8)quick fear that was strange to them.

There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the
leaves(1323,8)Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with
closed eyes, for(1597,11)(480,9)communing with God and(485,10)
But again he lea(168,10)owards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
with an aspec(1542,9)deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these
words:

“(1027,11)God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press
upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
Jonah teaches to all sinners(1898,9)refore to ye, and still more to
me, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come
down(1340,8)is mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit,
and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads _me_ that other
and more awful(306,8)which (307,17)_me_, as a pilo(543,8)
living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true
things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the
ears of a wicked Nineveh,(1758,8)appalled at the hostility he should
raise, fled(1160,10)mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God
by taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never
reached. As we have seen, God came upon him(1967,8)wha(995,8)swallowed
him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift (1727,8)s tore him
along ‘into the mids(1057,9)seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked him
ten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped about(1199,9),’
and all the watery world of woe bowl(1453,8)him. Yet even then beyond
the reach of any plummet—‘ou(1279,9)belly of hell’—whe(364,11)
grounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones,(124,10), God heard the
engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the
fish; and(1112,8)e shuddering cold and blacknes(1717,9)sea,(204,11)came breeching up(1600,13)warm and pleasant sun, (394,11)
delights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah(310,10)dry land;’
(354,10)ord(1888,8)Lord(1963,8)second time; and(991,8)bruised and
beaten—his ears, like two sea-shells,(1505,8)ultitudinously murmuring
of(467,10)—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that,
s(1798,8)? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! T(72,8)it!

“This, (78,9), this is(1487,11) lesson; and woe to that(1455,9)
the(1026,8)God who slights it. Woe to him wh(1696,8)world charms from
Gospel duty!(52,15) seeks to pour oil(792,10)waters when God
has brewed them into a gale(87,27)lease rather than

not be true(1011,9)ough to be false were salvation! Yea,(432,8)him
who, as the great Pilot Paul has it(2023,8)preaching to others is
himself a castaway!”

He dropped and fell away(1767,8)mself for a moment; then lifting his
face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as(1219,9) out with
a heavenly enthusiasm,—“But oh!(746,10)! on the starboard hand of
every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that(36,8),
than the bottom(1751,8)woe is deep. Is not the main-truck(90,10)an
the kelson is low? Delight is to him—a far, far upward, and inward(1344,8)—who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever
stands forth his own inexorable self.(156,18) whose strong
arms yet support him, (1789,9)ship(125,9)base treacherou(1076,8)has

will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final
breath—O Father!—chiefly known to me by Thy rod—mortal or immortal,
here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more tha(23,8)(1765,10)’s,
or mine own. Yet(1895,9)nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is
man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?”

He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
his hands, and so remained kneeling, till(593,8) people had departed,
and he was left alone in the place.


CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.

Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
quite alone; he having left(63,11) before the(292,12) some
time. He was sitting on a bench(60,12)fire,(675,11)eet on the
stove hear(1168,8)in one hand was holding close up to(412,10)that
little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to
(2029,8)in his heathenish way.

But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going
to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap
began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth
page—as I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and
giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He
would then begin again at the next fifty; see(1353,8)commence at number
one each time, as(1787,11)could not count(1271,11)fifty, and it was
only by such(414,9)number of fifties being found together, that his
(231,12)(204,8)multitude of(439,8)as excited.

With much interest I sat watching him. Savage(2010,11)was, and
hideously marred ab(1380,8)face—at least to my taste—his countenance
yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You
cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I
saw the traces of a simple honest heart;(1148,8)his large, deep eyes,
fiery black and bold, there seemed token(97,8)pirit that would dare a
thousand devils. And besides all this(89,8)was a certain lofty
bearing(405,11)Pagan, which even his uncouthness(698,10)
al(615,8) maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never
had had a creditor. Whether it was, too(714,10) head being shaved,
his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked
more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to
decide; but(362,9)it was(185,10)was phrenologically an excellent
one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington’s
head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long
regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows(572,8)were
likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on
top. Queequeg was George(240,11) cannibalistically developed.

Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending(1950,11)to be
(1666,8)ou(1348,9)storm from the casement, he never heeded my
presence, never troubled (2033,8)with so much as a single glance; but
appeared wholly occupied with(1931,20)of the marvellous
book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping(1620,9) the night
previous, and especially c(90,11)the affectionate arm I had found
thrown over me upon waking(694,8)morning(1420,12)this indifference
of his very strange. But savages are(25,8) beings; at times you do
not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their
calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had
noticed also that(771,10)never consorted at all, or but very little,
with the other seam(1039,10)inn. He made no advances whatever;(622,10)to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.
All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second(1916,8)(1735,8)
was something almost sublime in it. H(1776,10)man some twenty (1843,8)
miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only
way he could get there—thrown among people as(636,9)to him as though
he were(1444,9)lanet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;
preserv(1020,8)utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;
always equal to(1177,8). Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;
though no doubt he had(1294,9)ard th(420,8)such a thing as that. But,
perhaps, to be tru(104,11)ers, we mortals should not be conscious of
so living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or(156,8)man
gives(1448,9)out for a(144,12), I conclude that(1767,8)he
dyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken his digester.”

As I sat th(548,9)at now lonely room; the fire burning low,(47,8)
mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then
only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering
round(1838,13)s, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the
storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of
(1551,8)feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart
and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing
savage had redeemed it. There he sat,(1764,10)(1789,12) speaking a
nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland
deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet(359,11)
feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that
would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus
drew me. I’ll try a pagan friend,(1637,8) I, since Christian kindness
has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some
friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk(1454,8)m meanwhile. At
first he little noticed these(1992,9); but presently, upon my
referring to his last night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me
whether we were agai(868,8)bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I
(375,8)h(1096,9)pleased, perhaps a(224,8)complimented.

We then(868,8)over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to
him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning(33,8)few pictures
that(1984,9)it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we
went to jabber(1986,8)best we could about the various outer(906,10)
be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,
producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And
then we sat exchanging puffs(246,12)ild pipe of his, and keeping it
regularly passing between us.

If there yet(1246,8)any ice of(1310,14)(1136,8)me in the Pagan’s
breast, this pleasant, gen(283,9) we had, soon thawed it out, and
left us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and
unbiddenly as I to him; and when our(139,8)as over, he pressed his
forehea(1646,10)mine, clasped me (1909,10)waist, and said that
henceforth(977,9)married;(766,8), in his country’s phrase,(712,11)re bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a
countryman, this sudden flame of(94,8)hip (1573,11)seemed far too
premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but(822,9)simple savage
those old rules would not apply.

After supp(1138,8)another(865,8)chat and smoke, we (1008,8)our room
(1203,8). He made me a(1466,8) of his embalmed head; took out his
enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the(38,8), drew out some
thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and
mechanically divi(45,10)into two equal portions, pushed on(1409,8)m
(945,10)(680,11)it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he
silenced me by pou(1370,8)m into my trowsers’ pockets. I let them stay.
He then went about his evening prayers,(399,13) idol, and removed
the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I (1828,11)seemed
anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I
deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or
otherwise.

I was a good Christian; born and bred(1406,8)bosom(1902,8)infallible
Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in
worshipp(1736,9)iece of wood? But what is worship?(360,9)I. Do you
suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
earth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an
insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible!(205,21)—to do
the will of God—_that_(246,11). And(267,9)(47,15)(70,9)o my fellow man what(525,9)have(32,15)to do to me(115,10)(141,16). Now, Queequeg is(102,14)(155,11)do I wish
that this(56,10)would(112,9)? Why,(545,12)me in my particular(614,14)form of(275,10)Consequently, I must then(632,12)him
in his; ergo(41,10)urn(652,9). So I kindled the shavings; helped
prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with
(323,8); salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that
done, we undressed and(1706,9)bed, at peace with our own consciences
(747,8)the world. But we did not go to sleep with(1659,8)(245,8)chat.

How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the
very bott(1205,9)ir souls to each other; and some old couples often
lie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our
hearts’ honeymoon, lay I and(844,9)—a cosy, loving pair.


CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.

We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and(647,9) now and then affectionately throw(1430,8)brown tattooed legs
over mine,(68,10)draw(1976,9)back; so entirely sociable and free
and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what
little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like
getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.

Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position
began to grow wearisome, and by(1143,8)and(1154,8)we found ourselves
si(207,8); the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
head-board(1097,10)four knees drawn up close (356,8), and our two
noses bending over them, as if (78,8)pans were warming-pans. We felt
very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;
indeed(21,8)bed-(277,8)too, seeing tha(1213,8)was no fire in the
room. T(123,10), I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some
small part of you must be cold, for(1343,13)quality in this world
that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If
you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been
so a long time, then you cannot be said to be(73,12) any more. But
if, like(1320,9) and m(385,8) bed, the tip of your nose or the crown
(26,8)head be slightly chilled, why(1462,9)deed,(98,8)general
consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For
this(1221,8)a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,
which is one of the luxurious discomforts(29,8)rich. For the height
of this sort of deli(226,10)is to have nothing(1992,8) blanket
(1946,8)you and your snugness(1615,8) cold(165,8)outer air. Then there
you lie like the one warm spark(492,8)heart of an arctic crystal(1808,10)been (1261,8)(801,8)crouching manner for some time, when all at
once I thought I would open my eyes; for when (258,8)sheets, whether
by day or by night, and(32,8) asleep or awake, I have a way of always
keeping(122,8) shut, in order(1268,10)to concentrate the(392,10)of
being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright
except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper
element(1981,8)essences(1880,9)light be more congenial to our clayey
part. Upon open(284,12)then, and coming(1519,8)my own pleasant and
self-created(186,10)into the imposed and coars(698,8)gloom of the
unilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable
revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from(1291,10)that
perhaps it were best to strike a light(1744,14)we were so wide
awake; and besides he felt a strong desire(1044,9)a few quiet puffs
from his Tomahawk. Be it said,(1865,8)ough I had felt such(101,9)
repugnance to his smok(972,9)e bed the night before, yet see how
elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.
For now I liked(1282,10)etter than(1310,9)(1690,9)(171,8)by me,
even in bed, because he seeme(1786,8)full of such serene household joy
then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of
insurance. I was only alive(606,8)condensed confidential
(2018,11)ness of sharing a pipe and a(1554,8)(1702,8)real friend.
With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the
(596,8) from on(185,9)other, till slowly there grew over us a blue
hanging tester of smoke, (969,12)by the flam(1885,9)new-lit lamp.

Whether it was(731,8)is undulat(100,11)rolled the savage away to
far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island;
and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He
gladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of
his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar
with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story
such as it may prove(1097,8)mere skeleton I give.


CHAPTER 12. Biographical.

(1400,9)was a(392,8)of Rokovoko, an island far(490,8) the West and
South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.

When a new-hatched(595,8)running wild about(554,12)woodlands in a
grass clout, follow(758,10)nibbling goats, as if he were a green
sapling; even then, in(1689,9)’s ambitious soul, lurked(1513,10)(1614,10)see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or
two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle(32,8)Priest; and
on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of
unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal
stuff;(1822,8)sadly vitiated, I fear,(1177,8)cannibal propensity he
nourishe(97,9)untutored youth.

A Sag Harbor ship visited h(324,9)’s bay, and(1754,11)ought a
passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of
seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King(159,14)influence
could prevail. But(1933,10)vowed a vow. Alone(377,8)canoe, he paddled
off to a(1423,10)trait, which he knew(221,9) must pass through when
she quitted th(1442,8). On one side was a coral reef; on(1736,10) a
low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into
the water. Hid(323,8)canoe, still afloat, among thes(83,10), with
its prow seaward, he sa(1203,10)the stern, paddle low in hand; and
when(314,10)was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her
side; with one backward dash(1815,8)foot capsized and sank(498,10);
climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the
deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though
hacked in pieces.

In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
cutlass over his naked wrists;(973,10)was the son of a King, and(1762,10)budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his
wild (1503,10)visit(1487,12),(228,13)at last relented, and
told him he might make(413,12)home(1139,8)is fine young savage—this
sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down
(802,9) sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter
content to toil(828,9)hipyards of foreign cities,(1406,10)disdained
no seeming ignominy, if thereby(303,10)happily g(596,8)power of
enlighten(1368,8)(1575,10)countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he
was actuated by a profoun(507,12)learn(1120,10)(1586,10)s, the
arts whereby to(484,8)s people still happier than they were; and more
than that(1242,8)bett(49,17). But, alas! the practices of
whalemen soon convinced him that even(193,11) could be both
miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all(1906,13)
heathens. Arrived(792,9)in old(1976,11); and seeing what the
sailors did th(288,9)then going on to Nantucket,(71,12)how they
spent their wages in _that_ place also, poor(1899,10)gave it up for
lost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a
pagan.

And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived(1740,13)(622,11)
wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer
ways about him(1487,8) now some time from home.

By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having
a coronation; since(1307,10)now consider(599,11) dead and gone, he
being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not
yet; and added that he was fearful(1000,10)ity, or rather(402,13)had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty
pagan Kings before(1412,10)by and by, he said, he would return,—as
soon as he felt(1638,9)baptized again. For the nonce, however, he
proposed to sail abou(868,8)ow his wild oats(763,8)four oceans. They
ha(1622,9)harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a
sceptre now.

(631,14)at might be his immediate purpose, touch(1563,8)future
moveme(530,16), to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon
this, I (2012,9)that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
intention(365,9)out of(1244,13)s be(584,8)most promising port
for an adventurous(1992,10)to embark from. He at once resolved to
accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the
same watch,(42,10)boat(15,11)mess with me, in short to share my
every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip(129,9) Potluck of
both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection
I now felt f(1577,11),(1065,8)an experienced(748,11), and as such,
could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was
wholly ignorant of the mysteries of(644,8)(1488,9)well acquainted
with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.

His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff,(1868,9)
embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the
light, we rolled over from each other, this way(1113,9), and very soon
were sleeping.


CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.

Next morning, Monday, after disposing(381,8)embalmed head to a barber,
for a block, I settled(1050,8)and comrade’s bill; using(1422,11)my
(35,10)money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
amazingly tickled(1831,8)sudden friendship which had sprung up between
me and(774,9)—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories
about him had previously so much alarmed me concern(1862,8)very person
whom I now companied with.

We borrowed a w(478,10), and embarking our things, including my own
poor carpet-bag,(250,13)’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went
down to “the Moss,” the little(1513,10) packet schooner moor(423,9)
wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at(1200,9) so
much—for they were u(2025,8)eeing cannibals like him in their
streets,—but at(51,8)him and me upon such confidential terms. But we
heeded them not,(200,13)wheel(1772,8)barrow by turns(384,14)
now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his(1435,8) barbs. I
asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing(1276,8)m ashore, and
whether all(1407,8) ships did not find their own(1572,8)s. To this, in
substance, he replied, that(1485,9)hat I hinted was true enough, yet
he had a particular(1741,10) for his(134,12), because it was of
assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal comb(1390,8)deeply intimate(1644,10)heart(1695,9)es. In short(1762,8)any inland reapers and
mowers, who go(2024,10)farmers’ meadows arm(1691,8)(360,9)
scythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so(1732,10),
(307,12)private reasons, preferred(342,16).

Shift(716,15)from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
the first(1225,12) he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The
owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his
heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant ab(1996,8)thing(398,11)truth he was entirely so,(1528,16)precise way in
(157,9)manage(1069,11)—(1263,9)puts his chest upon it; lashes it
fast;(1091,11)houlders(1148,12)and marches up the wharf. “Why,”
said I, “(561,9) you might have known better than that, one would
think. Didn’t(1483,12)laugh?”

Upon t(557,17)nother story. T(1540,10)of his island of
Rokovoko(504,12)at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water
of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and
this(20,10) always forms the great central ornament on the braided
mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once
touched at (291,10)and its commander—from all accounts, a very
stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this
(99,9) was invited to the(408,14) of(1996,9)’s sister, a
pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all(99,12)
guests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain
(806,8)in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over
against the(565,10)(81,8)tween the High Priest and his majesty the
King(1476,10)’s father. Grace being said,—for thos(885,9)have their
grace as well as we(1612,8)(1128,9)(1466,8)that unlike us, who at such
times look downwards to our platters, they,(741,8)contrary, copying
the ducks, glance up(74,9)(822,10)Giver of all feasts—Grace, I
say,(254,12)(333,17)open(1281,8)nquet by the immemorial
ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and
(16,9)ing fingers(2007,10)bowl before the blessed beverage
circulates. Seeing(576,9)placed next the Priest, and no(1929,8)(190,9), and think(70,11)—being(725,8) of a ship—as having plain
precedence over a mer(268,8) King, especially in the King’s own
house—the(109,9)coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the
(1358,10)—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said
(1711,10)“what you tink now?—Didn’t our(1675,17)At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the
schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one
side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees
all glittering(418,8)clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of
casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the
world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while
from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises
of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises
were(1966,8)start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only
begins a second; and(14,9)(42,12) (42,9)third, and so on,
for ever(210,8) aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness
of all earthly effort.

Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his
snortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurn(31,8)turnpike
earth!—that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish
heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimit(1614,9)sea
which will permit no records.

At the same foam-fountain(2035,10) seemed to drink and reel with me.
His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed
teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to
the blast; ducked and dived(501,9) as a slave(1822,12)Sultan.
Sideways leaning, we s(21,8)darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
wire; the two tall masts buck(41,10)Indian canes in land tornadoes.
So full of this reeling scene were we, as(1568,10)by the plunging
bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of
the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvell(785,9)wo fellow
beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything
more dignified than(46,8)washed negro. But there were some boobies
and bumpkins there, who, by(1765,8)ntense greenness, must have come
from the heart and centre of all verdure.(842,10)caught one of these
young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the(195,8)’s
hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon(1356,9)wny savage caught
him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,
sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly ta(167,10)stern
in mid-somerset, the fellow land(1337,8)bursting lungs upon his feet,
while(1226,9), turn(271,8)back(48,8)m, lighted his tomahawk pipe
and passed it to me for a puff.

“Capting! (9,8)” y(773,8)(422,9), running towards that officer;(70,9),(70,8), here’s the devil.”

“Hallo, _you_ sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib(1551,11), stalking
up to(283,11)“what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you know
you might have ki(1018,10)chap?”

“What him say?” said(402,11)as he mildly(1756,8)to me.

“He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing
to the still shivering greenhorn.

“Kill-e(331,9)(562,11)wist(834,8)tattooed face into an unearthly
expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;(1896,10)no kill-e
so(38,26)kill-e big whale!”

“Look you,” roar(525,16)“I’ll(297,8)_you_, you cannibal, if
you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”

But it so happened just then, that it was high time for(696,12) to
m(1266,8)own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted
the weather-sheet, and the tremendous b(1327,8)now flying from side to
side, completely sweeping the entire after part(875,8)deck. The poor
fellow whom(1549,10)had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all
hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,
seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again,(1543,8)in
one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of
snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing(78,8)capable
of being done; those on deck rushed(1392,11)e bows, and stood eyeing
(297,9)as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the
midst of this consternation,(999,10)dropped deftly to his knees, and
crawling under the path(1479,8)boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured
one end to the bulwarks(774,9)n fling(714,8)other like a lasso,
caught it round(589,10)as it(676,11) his head, and(632,8)next
jerk, the spar was that way trappe(53,8)ll was safe. The schooner was
run into the wind, and while the (797,11)clearing away the stern
boat(392,10), strippe(292,9)waist, darted from the side with a long
living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming
like a dog, throw(1636,8)long arms straight out before him, and by
turns reveal(1698,8)brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I
looke(433,9)grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.
The(1868,10) had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly(359,9)
water(415,12)now took an(1099,8)’s glance around(271,10)seeming
to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few(444,8)
more, and he rose(1281,8)one arm still striking out, and with(850,10)
dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up(1595,11)bumpkin was restored. All hands voted(1621,10)a noble trump; the
captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to(1702,10)like a
barnacle; yea, till poor(1743,10)took his last long dive.

Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he
at all deserved a medal(936,10)Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He
only asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off; that
done, he put on dry clothes, light(362,8)ipe, and leaning against the
(1430,14)mildly eyeing thos(744,14)seemed(893,9)ying to
himself—“It’s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We
cannibals must help these Christians.”


CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.

(1968,8)more happen(2031,11)assage worthy the mentioning; so, after a
fine run, we safely arrived in(115,14)(127,8)! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of
the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely
than the Eddystone lighthouse. L(141,9)—a mere hillock, and elbow of
sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than
you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some
gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant wee(306,10)they
don’t grow naturally;(64,11)import Canada thistles(34,12)have
to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that
pieces of woo(595,14) are carried about like bits of the true
cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools(1977,8)their houses,
to get under the shade in summer ti(95,9)one blade of grass makes an
oasis, three blades in a day’s walk a prairi(175,8)they wear quicksand
shoes, (1277,10)like Laplander snow-sho(410,14)are so shut up,
belt(320,8), every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island
of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will
sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these
extravaganzas only show that(577,11)is no Illinois.

Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
settled(269,8)red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle
swooped down upon the New England coast, and(771,9)off an infant
Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child
borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the
same direction. Setting out in(115,8)anoes(1625,9) perilous(1677,8)
they discovered the island, (1359,12)ey(569,8)n empty ivory
casket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.

What wonder, the(720,9)hese(1864,10)ers, born on a(1537,8)should
take(688,8)sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs
in the sand; grown bol(152,8)y waded out with nets for mackerel; more
experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,
launching a navy of great ships on(237,8), explored this watery world;
put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at
Behring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared
everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
flood; most monstrous and(19,8)untainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea
Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that
his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
malicious assaults!

And thus have these naked(772,15)these sea hermits, issuing from
their ant-hill (725,8)ea, overrun and conqu(989,9)(565,12) like
so many Alexanders; parcell(1104,8)among them the Atlantic, Pacific,
and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America
add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English
overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;
two thirds of this terraqueous globe are th(1206,13)’s. For(1179,8)
is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a
right of way through it. Merchan(1064,8)are but extension bridges;
armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though
following(1402,9)as highwaymen the roa(1288,8)but plunder(219,8)hips,
other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw
their liv(779,8) the bottomless deep itself. T(423,14), he alone
resides and riot(1389,12);(39,9), in Bible language, goes down to
it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.
_There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noah’s flood
would not interrupt(450,8) it overwhelmed all the millions in China.
He live(1659,14)as prairie cocks(1135,8)prairie; he hides among
the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years
he knows not(554,9); so that when he comes to it(1882,9) it smells
like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.
W(1748,8)landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to
sleep between billows; so at nightfall,(1122,16), out of sight
of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his
very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.


CHAPTER 15. Chowder.

It was quite late(1678,8)evening when the little Moss came snugly to
anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no
(798,8) that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. T(467,8)ord
of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us(342,8)cousin Hosea Hussey of the
Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one(1298,8)best kept
hotels in all(1649,10), and moreover he had assured us that Cousin
Ho(965,8)he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he
plainly hinted that(391,10)not possibly do better than try pot-luck
at the (284,8). But the directions(203,8)given us about keeping a
yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to
the larboard, and then(105,9)that(1553,8)(39,8)(90,14)made a
corner three points to the(147,10)(96,8)at done, then ask the first
man we met where the place was: these crooked(305,12)of his very
much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset,(881,9)
insis(482,9)the (368,16)—our first point of departure—must be
lef(319,22), whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say
it wa(1946,10)(484,8). However, by dint of beating about a(1134,8)in
the dark, and now(497,11)nocking up a peaceable inhabitant to
inquire the way, we(1643,8) came to something which there was no
mistaking.

Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’ ears,
swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an
old doorway. The horns(1160,8)(85,12)were sawed off(796,8)other
side,(1944,9)this(126,13) looked no(407,11)like a gallows.
Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions(708,8)time, but I
(1168,10)help staring (148,8)gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort
of crick was in my neck as I gazed up(997,8)two remaining horns; yes,
_two_ of them, one for(1757,9), and(22,9)me. It’s ominous, thinks
I. A(789,8)my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;
tombstones(271,12)m(1956,9)whalemen’s chapel; and her(414,11)!
and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out
oblique hints touching Tophet?

I was(1698,8)(730,8)se refl(1568,8)by the sight of a freckled woman
with(1206,8)hai(2027,8)yellow gown, st(312,10)the porch(1917,8)inn,
under a dull red lamp swinging there, tha(733,9)much like an injured
eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding(656,8)man in a purple woollen
shirt.

“Get alo(50,8)ye,” said she(1653,8)man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”

“Come on(1524,10)(68,8)I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”

And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey bei(1181,8)ho(928,8)leaving
(83,11) entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon
making known our desires for a suppe(505,8)bed,(198,12),
postponing further(395,10)for the present, ushered us into(1623,9)
room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently
concluded repast,(343,8)round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”

“What’s that about Cods, ma’am?(473,10)with much politeness.

(80,14) she repeated.

“A clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean(366,13)?”
says I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception(1184,9)inter
time, ain’t it(99,16)
But being in a great hurry to resume(880,10)the(877,8)the purple
Shirt, who was wait(530,8)it(1327,8)entry(503,8)eming to hear nothing
but the word “clam,”(839,12) hurried towards an open door leading
to the kitchen, and bawling out “(412,9)two,” disappeared.

“(990,20)do you think that we can make out(827,10)for us
both on one clam?”

However, a warm savory steam(1461,9)(184,8) served to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder
came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!
hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than
hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up
into little flakes; the whole enrich(89,8)butter, and plentifully
season(127,9)e(1286,9)salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the
frosty voyage, and in particular(1593,10) seeing his favourite fishing
food(460,8)him, and the(447,8)(128,8)urpassingly excellent, we
despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and
bethinking me of(1743,12)’s clam and cod announcement, I thought I
would try(1534,9) experiment. Stepping(1923,8)(764,8)door, I uttered
(1045,11)od”(210,13)mphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few
moments the savou(889,9)came forth again, but with a different
flavor(471,9)good time a fine cod-(417,8)was place(456,9)us.

We(161,9)business; and while plying our spoons(1481,8)bowl, thinks I
to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s
that stultifying saying about(1068,8)-headed people? “But look,
(1321,9) ain’t that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”

Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its
name; for the pots there were always boil(1288,11)s. Chowder for
breakfast, and(878,9)for dinn(1079,8)(24,12)supper, till you
began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area
before the house was pav(1308,8)clam-shells.(1821,13)wore a
polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea(1884,9)ad his account
books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the
milk, too(445,8)I could not at all(116,8) fo(333,8)one morning
happen(1063,8)ake a stroll along the beach among some fishermen’s
boats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and
marching(112,11)sand with each foot in a cod’s decapitated head,
looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.

Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from(1440,12)
concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as(1684,10)was about to
precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded
his(1004,8); she allowed no(1028,8) in her chambers. “Why not?” said I;
“every true whaleman sleeps with (105,11)—but w(67,9)“Because
it’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stigg(946,9)from that
unfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with
only three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back,
(247,16) in his side; e(209,10)then I allow no boarders to
take sich(281,10) weep(1661,10)ir rooms at night. So, Mr.(570,9)”
(for she had learned his name), “I will just take(1705,11)iron, and
keep it for you till(1028,8). But the(1688,8); clam or cod to-morrow
for (1481,11)men?”

“Both(499,8)I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of
variety.”


CHAPTER 16. The Ship.

In bed we concocted our plans(1694,9)morrow. But to my surprise and no
small concern,(932,10)now gave me to understand, that he had been
diligently consulting Yojo—the nam(702,8) black little god—and Yojo
had told him two or three times ov(1815,8)strongly insisted upon it
everyway, that instead of our going together am(1489,8)whaling-fleet in
harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;(101,12)this, I say,
Yojo earnestly enjoined that the(78,8)on of the ship should rest
wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order
to do so, had already pitch(317,8)a vessel, which, if left to myself,
I, Ishmael,(167,8)infallibly light upon, for all the world as though
it had turned out by chance;(369,8)that vessel I must immediately ship
myself,(747,9)present irrespective of(1654,9).

I have forgotten to mention that, in many things(783,11)placed great
confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and(888,8)ing forecast
of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather
good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in
all cases did not succeed(1517,8)benevolent designs.

Now, this plan(366,12)’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching(768,14)
of(849,12)I(131,9)like that plan at all. I had not a little
reli(1032,8)(131,10) sagacity to point out(1011,9)er best fitted to
carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances
produced no effect(147,14), I was obliged to acquiesce; and
accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined
rushing(532,9)energy and vigor, that(1128,8)quickly settle that
trifling(1447,8)affair. Next(1830,8) early, leaving(1592,10)shut up
with Yojo in our(1524,8)bedroom—for it seem(1301,8)it was some(722,8)
Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with
(1745,9)(1641,8) that day; _how_(119,8)I never could find out, for,
though I applied myself to it several times,(74,15)master his
liturgies and XXXIX Articles—(330,16), then,(231,8) on his
tomahawk pipe,(214,10)warming himself at his sacrificial fire of
shavings, I sallied out(1809,11)shipping. After much prolonged
sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt(1778,9)re were three
ships up f(2025,8)-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the
Pequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;
_Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated
tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I
peered and pryed(1012,9)(266,11); from her, hopped over to the
Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for
a momen(363,10)n decid(941,8)this(272,9)very ship for us.

You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I
know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box
galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a
rare old craft as this same (28,9)(645,8)She was a ship of the old
school,(1808,8)small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed
look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and
calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a
French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her
venerable bows(648,8)bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of
Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—h(101,8)
stood stiffly up like the spines(463,8)three old kings of Cologne. Her
(980,8)decks were worn and wrinkled,(93,10)pilgrim-worshipped
flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these
(464,8)antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining
to the wild business that for more than half a century she had
followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he
commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one
of the principal owner(472,9)Pequod,—this old(163,8)during the term
of his(171,11)ship, had built upon(648,14)grotesqueness, and
inlaid it, all over, with(1314,9)ness both of material and device,
unmatched by(1098,9) except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or
bedstea(1214,12)pparell(1004,9)ny barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his
neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory(1318,12)thing of
trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth(1249,8)chased
bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were
garnish(1256,8)one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the
sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten(1401,10)empen thews
and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,
but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-(412,8)corning a turnstile
wheel at her reverend helm, she spo(226,11)a tiller; and that tiller
was in one mass, curiously(664,8)from(347,10)narrow lower jaw of her
hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by(128,12) in a tempest,
felt(1508,10)Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching
its jaw. A noble(689,8)but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things
are touched(609,8)at.

Now when I(1824,8)about the quarter-deck, for some one having
authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at
first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of
tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It
seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical
shape, some ten feet high; consisting(2026,8)long, huge slabs of limber
black bone taken(698,10)middle and highest part(1638,8)jaw(1650,8)
right-whale. Plant(509,10)eir broad ends on the deck, a circle of
thes(159,8)laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at
the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved
to and fro(857,10)top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A
triangular opening fac(194,11)the bo(330,9) ship, so that the
insider commanded a complete view forward.

And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by
his aspect seemed to have (904,9); and who, it being noon, and the
ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite(1331,10)burden of
command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all
over with(1447,8) carving(1497,8)e bottom of which was formed of a
stout interlac(858,11)same elastic stuff(69,10)the wigwam was
constructed.

There was nothing so very particular, perhaps,(1324,11)appearanc(822,8) elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,
and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;
only t(214,9)a fine and almost microscopic net-work(1185,8)minutest
wrinkles(364,13)round his eyes, which must have aris(1210,8)his
continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to
windward;—for this causes the muscles(1724,11)eyes to become pursed
(1212,8). Such eye-(219,9)are very effectual in a scowl.

“Is this the Captain(1482,8)Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door(538,8)tent.

“Supposing it be the c(89,20), what dost thou want of
him?” he demanded.

“I was thinking of shipping.”

“Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a
stove boat?”

“No, Sir, I never have.”

“Dost know(847,9)at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?

“Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been
several voyages(796,8)merchant service, and I think that—”

“M(39,15) be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that
leg?—I’ll take that leg away(1999,8)y stern, if ever thou talkest(1097,8)ma(142,15)to me again. M(30,16)indeed! I suppose
now ye feel considerable proud of having serv(1693,8)os(122,10)
ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a(478,10)eh?—it
looks a little suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast
thou?—Didst not rob thy last(919,8), did(731,8)—Dost not think of
murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”

I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of
these half humorous innuendoes, this(1540,9)an, as an insulated
Quakerish(928,12), was full of his insular prejudic(1369,8)rather
distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the
Vineyard.

“But what t(523,10)a-whaling? I(536,9)know that before(891,9)of
(1189,8) ye.”

“Well, sir,(65,11)see wha(1083,9) is.(31,15)the world.”

“W(57,26), eh? Have ye clapped eye on(1505,9)Ahab?”

“Who is(24,13), sir?”

“Aye, aye, I thought so.(70,13) (1595,20)is ship.”

“I am mistaken then.(79,11)I was speak(1623,11)(1672,8)himself(1505,10)art(45,13)(1713,8)Peleg—that’s who ye are(89,12),
young man. It belongs(1143,8)nd(1790,9)Bildad(377,12)Pequod fitted
out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We
are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if(1838,10)est
(641,8)(520,17)as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way
of finding it ou(716,9)ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap
(617,19), (378,9), and thou wilt find that he has only one
leg.”

“What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”

“L(20,14)! Y(137,10)come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed
up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a
boat!—ah, ah!”

I wa(1587,11)alarmed by his energy, perhaps also(1632,10)touched at
the hearty grief in his co(620,9)exclamation, but said as calmly as I
could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know
there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed
I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”

“Look ye now(642,13)thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou
d(1894,9)alk shark a bit. _Sure_, ye’ve been to sea(1542,8)now; sure
of that?”

“Sir,” said I, “(1291,12)told you that I had been four voyages in
the merchant—”

“Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant
service—don’t aggravate me—I won’(393,8)t. But let us understand each
other. I have given thee a hint abo(1871,8)(1765,10); do ye yet feel
inclined for it?”

“I do, sir.”

“Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live
whale’s throat(1168,8)en jump after it? Answer, quick!(1737,8), sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to
be got rid of, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”

“Good again. Now then, thou not only(1559,8) to go a-whaling, to find
out by experience(1594,18)but ye also wan(77,8)in order to
(1819,8)world? Was not that what ye said?(2029,11)so. Well then, just
step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow(442,11)back
(1991,10)tell me(134,10)ee there.”

For a moment I stood(1418,10)puzzl(1508,8)is curious request, not
knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But
concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl,(1875,9)Peleg started
me on the errand.

Going(340,9)and glancing(330,17) bow, I perceived that the
ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely
pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but
exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest varie(1934,8)I
could see.

“Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye
see?”

“Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though,
and there’s a squall coming up, I think.”(190,13) does(1276,8)ink then of seeing(926,12)Do ye wish to go
round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’(840,12) world where
you stand?”

I was(845,10)staggered, but(1165,13) I must, and I would;(1419,8)
Pequod was as good a ship as any—(1844,10)the best—and all this I now
repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his
willingness to ship me.

“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come
along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the
cabin.

Seated(1026,8)transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
surprising figure. It turned out to be(1147,9)Bildad, who (197,10)
(1178,14)was one of the largest owners(22,8)vessel; the other
shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd
of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;
each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a
nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in
(1941,8)vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state
stocks bringing in good interest.

Now,(475,9)like Peleg, and indeed many other(180,10)ers, was a
Quaker, the island having been originally sett(1891,9)at sect; and to
this day its inhabitants in general retain in an(717,10)measure the
peculiaritie(625,9)(162,8)only variously and anomalously modified by
things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For som(757,8)se same
Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They
are fighting Quakers; they ar(219,8)s with a vengeance.

So(2001,9)re are instances among them of men, who, named with
Scripture names—a singularly common fashion(1156,8)island—and in
childhood naturally imbib(1697,8)stately dramatic thee a(1380,8)of th(328,8) idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless
adventur(1172,8)ir subsequent lives, strangely blend with these
unoutgrown (604,13), a thousand bold dashes of character, not
unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when
these things unite in a man of greatly superior(373,8) force, with a
globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and
seclusion of many long night-watches(1273,8)remotest waters, and
beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think
untraditionally(1207,9)pendently; receiving all nature’s sweet or
savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental
advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes
one in a whole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for
noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him,(965,9)ally
regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems
a half wilful overruling morbidness(546,8)bottom of his nature. For
all men tragically great are made so through a certain(99,11). Be
s(1091,9)is, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.
But, as yet we have not to do with such an one(569,11)quite another;
and still a ma(1469,8)if(1970,8)(1798,8), it only results again from
another phas(1725,8)(1835,9)(1804,11) individual(435,14).

Like Captain Peleg,(15,9)Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.
But unl(77,17)—who cared not a rush for what are called
serious things,(1032,9)ed deemed those self-same (50,14) the
veriest(1947,8)trifles—(209,15)had not only been originally
educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but
all his(1705,12)ocean life(1124,9) sight(1408,9)unclad, lovely
island(994,9)s, round the Horn—all that(208,9)moved this native
born Quaker one single jot,(262,9)so much as altered one angle of his
vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common
consistency about worthy(626,15). Though refusing, from
conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn
foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled
tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now(1933,8)contemplative evening
of his days, the pious(963,8)reconciled these(820,8)in the
reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,
and very probably he had long since come(848,9)age and sensible
conclusion that a man’s religion is one thing(1963,8)is practical world
(1389,13). This world pays dividends. Rising from a little
cabin-boy in short clothes(1381,8)drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a
broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,
chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted
before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retir(281,8)
active life(1965,8)goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining
days(1354,8)quiet receiving(2036,8)well-earned income.

Now,(219,9)I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
incorrigible old hunk(1631,9) his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
task-master. They told me in(1538,10),(1056,8)it certainly seems a
curious story, that when he sa(920,8) old Categut(1884,9), his crew,
upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashor(876,9)hospital,
sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,
he was(235,11)rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used
to swear(318,8), at his men, they said; but somehow he got an
inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When
Bildad was a (888,12)to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking
at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch
something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at(67,10) or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perish(1076,9) him. His own person(2015,8) exact embodiment(962,8)utilitarian
character. On his long, gaunt body, he(688,9)no spare flesh, no
superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like
the worn nap(1130,8)broad-brimmed hat.

Such, then,(232,9)pers(1677,8)I saw seated on the transom when I
followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks
was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old(1526,9)who always sat so,
and never leaned(1842,11)to s(731,8)coat tails. H(285,13) was
placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed;(816,9) vesture was
buttoned up to(457,9); and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in
read(1970,11)ponderous volume.

“Bildad,” cri(396,16), “at it again(1625,10)eh? Ye have been
studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my
certain knowledge. How far ye got(1750,8)?”

As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
(519,9)ithout notic(1926,8)present irreverence, quie(1215,8)ed up,
and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.

“He says he’s our ma(350,10)” said(385,9)he wants to ship.”

“Dost thee?” sai(728,10)in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.

“I _dost_(115,8)I unconsciously, he was so intense(1747,9).

“What do ye think of him(426,10)(201,11).

“He’ll do(226,8)(590,9)y(324,9)and then went on spelling away at
his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.

I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw(1985,13)as Peleg,
his friend and(586,14)(885,8)such a blusterer. But I said
nothing, on(1793,10) round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,
and drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink (1699,10)(693,8)ated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time
to settle with my(75,8)what terms I would be willing to engage for
the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid
no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received (1142,8)shares
of the profits called _lays_(1550,8)at these lays were proportioned to
the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the
ship’s company(286,10)so(283,12)being a green hand at(298,8), my
own lay would not be very large; but considering(1981,8)was used to the
sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt
that from all I had heard I sh(556,8)offered at least the 275th
lay—that is,(23,10) part of the clear net proceed(340,8) voyage,
whatever that might eventually amount to. And though(109,11)lay was
what they call a rather _long lay_, yet(827,8)better than nothing; and
if we had a lucky(169,8) might pretty nearly pay(1870,9)clothing I
would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,
for which(955,9)not have to pay one stiver.

I(318,8)be(1386,9)that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
fortune—and so it was, a very(64,10)indeed(1368,8)am one of those
that never take on about(103,9) fortunes, and am quite content if the
world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this
grim sign(659,8)Thunder Cloud. Upo(1235,8)ole, (1703,10)(1119,8)
(618,11)(1346,8)about the fair thing, but(426,16)been
surprised had I been(857,9)the 200th,(1019,13)I was of a
broad-shouldered make.

But one(126,8)nevertheless, that made me(1618,10)distrustful about
receiving a generous share(964,8)(1410,8)was this: Ashore,(1076,12)
something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;
how(1497,9)y be(1584,8)principal proprietor(1101,9)Pequod, therefore
the other and more in(1371,8)able and scattered owners, left(990,8)the
whole managemen(1241,9)(2026,8)ffairs to these two. And I did not know
bu(1933,8)he stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about
shipping(1874,8)especially as I now found him on board(290,12)
quite at home there(2004,8)cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his
own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his
jack-knife,(268,11), to my no small (830,8)(800,14)that he
was such an interested party in these(1662,8)ings;(372,8)never heeded
us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”

“Well,(810,9)Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay
shall we give this young man?”

“Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘(233,10) and rust do
corrupt, but _lay_—’”

_Lay_, indeed,(1728,9)I, and such a lay! (159,37)! Well(598,14)you are determined that I, for one,
shall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below(457,12)(224,20). It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that(242,8); and though from
the magnitud(1418,9)figure i(2026,8)at first deceive a landsman, yet
the slightest(1631,9)ation will s(1391,11)ough(506,32) is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a
_teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say,(1910,9)(644,35)part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven
(722,11) (216,14)gold doubloons; and so I(651,9)at the time.

“Why, blast your eyes,(961,10)cri(955,11)thou dost not want to
swindl(947,16)! he must have more than that.”

“S(925,16)(203,14)th,” again sai(1366,10)without lifting
his eyes(636,8)en(1277,17)—“for where your(1236,9) is, there
will your heart be also.”

“I am going to put him down for the three(1130,8)th,” sai(1269,10)do
ye hear that(354,8)! T(60,18) lay, I say.”

Bildad laid down(1464,11)and turning solemnly towards him said,
“(1432,8)Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou mu(874,11) the
duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans,
many of them—and that if we too abundantly rew(2038,8)labo(94,10)
(1560,9), we may be taking the bread from those (138,11)those
orphans. T(1574,20)(649,16) lay(1758,10)Peleg.(1682,9)Bildad!” roar(1768,10)starting up and clattering about the
cabin. “Blast ye(1859,17) if I had followed thy advice in these
matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lu(133,10)at would be
heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape
Horn.”
(630,16)”(966,12) steadily, “thy(159,12)may be drawing
ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art
still an impenitent man(465,15), I greatly fear lest thy
(316,11)be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee(323,8)ing
down(821,8)fiery pit(599,20)F(29,8)!(40,10)! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye
(45,9). It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that
he’s bound to hell. Flukes and flames!(1436,9)say that again to me,
and start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat
with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,
drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”

As he thundered out this he made a rush at(1701,9)but with a
marvellous oblique, sliding celerity(1906,8) for that time eluded him.

Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
responsible(1454,13)e ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all
idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
commanded, I stepped aside(1459,8)e door(122,9)egress to(1302,9)who,
I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the
transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
withdrawing. He(62,8)quite used to(1219,12)Peleg and his ways. As
for(2024,8)after letting off his rage as he had, ther(110,9)no more
left in him, and he, too,(261,10)like a lamb, though he twitched a
little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the
squall’s gone off to leeward, I think.(1843,9)thou(305,9)be good at
sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs
the grindstone. That’s he; thank ye(973,8). Now then, my young man,
Ishmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,
for the three hundredth lay(1922,26)I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship
too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”

“To be sure(2027,8)Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”

“What lay does he want?” groaned(1640,9)glancing up(1076,10)book in
which he had again been burying himself.

“Oh! never thee mind about that(1430,8)(209,16)Has he ever
whaled it any?” turning to me.

“Killed more whales than I can count, (425,13).”

“Well,(370,11)along then.”

And(991,8)signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I
had done a good morning’s work, a(797,8)the Pequod was the identical
ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.

But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me(160,9)
(749,8)with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,
indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and
receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes(662,8) visible by
arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,
and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the
(171,8)(1078,8)amily, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he
does not trouble(243,9)much about his ship in port, but leaves her to
the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to
have a(1155,12) before irrevocably committing yourself into his
hands. Turning back I accosted(982,14), inquiring where(1013,8)
Ahab(682,8)be found.

“And what dost thou want of(1072,9)Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou
art shipped.”

“Yes, but I should like to see(1416,9)But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present.(47,9)know
exactly what’s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the
house; a sort of sick, and yet he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t
sick; but no, he isn’t well either. Any how,(1950,11) he won’t always
see me, so(276,9)suppose he will thee. He’s a queer man(1496,9)
Ahab—so some think—but(1399,8)one. Oh, thou’lt like him well(464,9)no
fear, no fear(113,9)grand, ungodly, god-like(132,13) Ahab;
doesn’t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.
Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’s above the common(25,9)been in
colleges,(914,9)as ’mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders
than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than
whales. His lance! aye, the keenest (1347,9)urest that out of all our
isle! Oh!(642,9)(2007,9)Bildad; no, and(33,18)Peleg;
_he’s Ahab_, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”

“And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did
they not lick his blood?”

“Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said(1273,8)with a significance in
his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that(1873,9)
the Pequod. N(36,9)it anywhere.(1328,13) did not nam(1668,9).
’Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died
(838,8)was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at
Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And,
perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn
thee. It’s a lie. I know(332,14)well; I’ve sailed(1505,9) as
mate years ago;(66,8)what he is—a good man—not a pious,(22,9),
like Bildad, but a swearing(60,10)something like me—only there’s a
good deal more of him. Aye, aye,(221,8)that(448,8)never very jolly;
and(41,13)on the passage home,(510,8)a little(1063,8)his mind
for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump
that brought that about, as any one might se(445,9), too, that ever
since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he(1487,8)a
kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but(1167,8)ll all
pass off. And once for all, let me(697,11)and assure thee, young
man, it’s better to sail(1157,8)moody good captain than a laughing bad
one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong no(1505,10)Ahab, because he happens
to have a(1397,8)name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages
wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that;(436,9)sweet girl that
old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm
in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his
humanities!”

As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been
incidentally revealed to me of(421,15)filled me(1687,8)certain
wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. An(1414,9), at the time,
I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don’t(1307,10),
unless(1049,12)cruel loss(1674,8)leg(1611,10)I also(121,9)trange
aw(1258,8)(878,11)sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was
not exactly awe; I do no(178,11) it was. But I felt it; and it did
not disincline me towards him; though(60,9)mpatience at what seemed
like mystery in him, so imperfectly as(1922,8)known to me then.
However, my(597,8)s were at length carried in other directions, so
that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.


CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.

As Queequeg’s(24,8), or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all
day, I did not choose to disturb him till(374,9)night-fall; for I
cherish the greatest respect(429,9)everybody’s religious obligations,
never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other
creatures in(1002,8) parts of our earth, who(1571,8)degree of
footmanism quite unprecedent(545,12)planets, bow down before the
torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the
inordinate possessions yet owned and r(145,9)his name.

I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
pagans and what not(1838,10)of their half-crazy conceits o(136,8)subjects. There wa(826,10), now,(1481,8)ly entertaining the most
absurd notions about Yojo and hi(896,9);—but what(1875,8)?(934,9)
thought he knew what(1136,8)about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;
and there let him rest. All our arguing with him w(827,9)avail; let
him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—(515,12)s and Pagans
alike—for we are all(1759,8) dreadfully cracked about the head, and
sadly need mending.

T(1080,10)ning, when(1571,8)assured that all his performances and
rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked(1941,8)door;
but no answer. I tried to open it, bu(1736,8) fastened inside.
“(619,9)” said I softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say,
(1512,8)! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still
as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant
time; I(1794,8) he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked(243,8)
(243,12); bu(368,10) opening into an odd corner of the room, the
(310,8) prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see
par(1332,8) foot-board(111,8)bed and a lin(1140,8) wall, but nothing
more. I was surpris(956,8)hold resting against(70,9) the wooden
shaft of(2010,12)harpoon, which the landlady the(800,8) previous
had taken from him,(1621,8)our mounting to the chamber. That’s strange,(1199,9)I; but at any rate, since the(159,8) stands yonder, and he
seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he(943,9)inside
here(1606,8) possible mistake.
(866,10)!—(809,9)”—all still. Something mus(682,9)ppened.
Apoplexy!(987,12)burst open(1034,10)(999,8)stubbornly resisted.
Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions(385,8)first person
I met—(408,11)-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “(904,10)s(228,13)
be the matter.(1267,8)to make(727,10)fter breakfast, and(906,10)was
locked;(1988,9)a mouse to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever
since. But(1083,10), may be, you had both gone off and locked your
baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.
Hussey! a(499,8)”—and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I
following.

Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation
of attend(987,12)astors, and scolding her little black boy
meantime.

“Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch
(658,10)to pry(846,14)—the axe!(9,9) he’s had a stroke;
depend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs
again empty-handed, when (444,12)interposed the(437,13)and(423,14)(809,10)entir(361,8) of her countenance.

“What’s(912,11) with you, young man?”

“Get (271,9)F(346,15)run for the doctor, some one, while I pry
it open!”

“Look here,” said(1600,13),(1184,9)putt(1215,9)the (240,14)
so as to have(707,10)free; “l(101,8); are you talking about prying
open any of my doors?(900,13)at she seized my arm. (323,11)
(323,15)? (351,28)shipmate?”

In as calm, but rapid a manner as(1628,9), I gave her to understand
the whole case. Unconsciously clapping(322,18) to one side of
her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t
seen it since I put it there.” (1684,8)to a(1010,8)closet under the
landing of the(1723,9)she glanced in, and returning, told me that
(1920,8)’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed himself,(1737,11). “It’s
unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes anot(878,10)rpane—God
pity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad
a sister? Where’s that girl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter,
and tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides permitted here, and
no smoking(1571,8)parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill?
The Lord be merciful to his ghost!(848,10)at noise there? Y(1201,9)
man, avast there!”

And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force
(1573,13).

“I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go(1322,8)
locksmith, there’s one about a mile from here. But avast!”(1300,9)her
hand in her side-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s
see.” A(1260,12), she turned i(2046,9)lock; but, alas! (865,10)
supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.

“Have to burst it open(1549,8)I, and was(443,9)(1538,9)entry a
little, for a good start, when(1616,13)(487,8)at me, again vowing
I should not break down her(450,9); but I tor(406,10), (1568,9)a
sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.

With a prodigious(732,10) door flew open(2013,10)knob slamming
(85,12)wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling;(73,8)re, good
heavens! there sat(475,9), altogether cool and self-collected; right
in the middle(1465,8)room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on
top of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat
like a carved image with scarc(1255,8) of active life.

“(249,9)(651,10)going up to him, (37,10) w(2022,21)
you?”

“He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said(697,13).

But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt
like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
eight or ten hours(421,8)too without his regular meals.

“Mrs. Hussey(1133,11)“he’s _alive_ at all events; so leave us, if you
please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”

Closing(991,10)upo(1196,14), I endeavored to prevail upon
(1395,8) to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could
do—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he w(1313,9)move a peg,
nor say a single word, nor even look(1395,8)nor notic(1818,8)sence in
the slightest way.

I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part(1075,8)Ramadan; do
they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;
yes, it’s(104,13)creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll
get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God,
and(231,12) only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very
punctual then.

I went down to supper. After(903,9)a long time listening(1627,8)long
stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,
as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a sch(347,8)
brig, confined(1792,8)north(1688,8)line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);
after(236,17)se(184,13)ers till nearly eleven o’clock, I
went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time(1928,9)
must certainly have brought(530,13)to a termination. But no; there
he was just where I had left him;(1412,8)not stirred an inch. I began
to grow vexed with him;(1558,14)downright senseless and insane to
be(1510,9)there(1812,8) and half the night on his hams in a cold room,
holding a piece of wood(52,9)ead.

“For heaven’s sake,(352,9), get up and shake yourself;(27,11)
have some(806,9)You’ll starve; you’ll kill(66,9)(103,10).” But
(1988,11)did he reply.

Despairing of him, therefore, I determ(726,8)(585,9) and to sleep;
and(1112,9), before a great while, (1496,9)follow me. But previous to
turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as
it promised to be a very cold night; and(635,11)hing but his
ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I c(1723,8)
get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere
(1680,8)of(922,9)—not four feet off—(724,14)in that uneasy
position, stark alone(1161,8)cold and dark; this made me really
wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night(1245,8)same room with a wide
awake pagan(859,16)this dreary, unaccountable(1887,8)!

But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew(464,9)more till break of
day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted(948,11)as if he
had been screwed(1740,9)the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of
sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but
with a cheerful look; limped towards me(1408,9)lay; pressed his
forehead again against mine; and said(1527,13)was over.

Now, as I(1017,8)hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion,
be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any
other person, because that (27,12) don’t believe it also. But when
a ma(160,12) becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment
to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to
lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and
argue the point(1863,9).

And just so I now did with(1611,10) “(1725,9)” said I, “(1255,9)bed
now, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise
and progress of the primitive(564,9)s, and coming(898,13)various
(42,9)(69,10)esent(1471,8)uring which time I labored to show
(1969,8) that all these Lents,(1185,8)s, and prolonged ham-squattings
in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;
useless(24,9)soul; opposed, in short,(1157,8)obvious laws of Hygiene
and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such
an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly
(22,11)to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous
(1170,8)of his. Besides, argued I, fasting(888,9)e body cave in;
hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must
necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic(682,9)ists cherish such melancholy notions(265,9)eir hereafters. In
one word,(1718,11)(940,8)rather digressively; hell is an idea first
born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated
through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by(838,9).

I then ask(1914,11) whether he himself was ever troubled with
(98,9); expressing the idea very plainly, so(749,9)could take it
in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great
feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of(62,8) battle
wherein fifty(1294,8)enemy had been killed by(805,8)wo o’clock in the
afternoon,(725,9)cooked and eaten that very evening.

“No more(594,11)(1535,10)shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the
inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who
had visited(173,11)island, and he told m(1802,8)t was the custom,
when(357,15)(330,10)gained there, to barbecue(1532,8) slain in
the yard or garden(1708,8)victor; and then, one by one, they were
placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,
with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,
were sent rou(51,8)(203,10)’s compliments to all his friends, just
as th(1017,8)s(1904,9)(1768,8)o many Christmas turkeys.

After all, I do not think that my remark(1278,8)(2011,8) made much
impression upon(1282,9). Because, in the first place, he somehow
seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered
from his own point of view; and(132,9)second(133,11)did not more
than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,
finally, he no doubt(1738,8) he knew a good deal more(1630,10) true(1690,9) than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending
concern and compassion, (557,10)he(151,9)it(1280,9)pity that such
a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan
piety.

At last we rose and dressed; an(1661,10), taking a prodigiously hearty
breakfast of chowders of all sorts(1640,10)the landlady(187,8)not
make much profit by reason of his(1826,8), we sallied out to board the
Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.


CHAPTER 18. His Mark.

As we were walking down the end(1689,8)wharf towards the ship(1597,10)
carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us(872,10)wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,
and(1668,8)more announcing that he let no(52,9)s on(373,9)at
craf(1034,10)they previously produced their papers.

“What do you mean by that(268,15)?(1901,10)now jump(1171,9)e
bulwarks, and leaving my comrade stand(49,10) wharf.

“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his(176,8)”

“Yes(2042,8)(430,8)Bildad(431,8)hollow voice, stick(488,9)ead from
behind Peleg’s, out(571,9)igwam. “H(134,12)that he’s converted.
Son of darkness,” he added, turning to(963,11)“art thou at(1686,8)
in communion with (1694,10)ian church?”

“Why(253,8)I, “he’s a member(2038,8)first Congregational Church.” Here
be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at
last come to be(280,10) into the churches.

“F(151,26),” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in
Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so sayin(1342,10)out
his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came(609,11)
(1066,8)and leaning stiffly over the (851,10)took(1823,8)long look at
(1562,8).

“How long hath he been(539,9)?” he then(501,8)(669,10)me; “not
very long, I rather guess,(1769,10).”

“No(897,8)Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it
would have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”

“Do tell, now(570,18)is this Philistine a regular(809,10)(586,19)(578,10)? I never saw him going there, and I pass
it every Lord’s day.”

“I don’t know anything about (708,19)or hi(705,9),” said
I; “all I know is, that(1731,9) here is a born(1030,15)First
(1030,22) He is a deacon himself(1822,10) is.”

“Y(504,8)(1394,8)Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain
thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”

Finding myself thus hard pushed, I(1601,8). (1623,8) sir, the same
ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, an(1632,10)Pele(511,8)
and(387,14), and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us
belong; the great(56,9)lasting (1330,18) of this whole
worshipping world; we all belong to that; only(868,9)us cherish some
queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in _that_ we all
join hands.”

“Splice, thou mean’st _splice_ hands(1525,9)Peleg, drawing nearer.(637,12) you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast
hand;(977,9)heard a(75,9)ermon.(916,19)—why Father
Mapple(806,8) couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come
aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog
there—what’s that you call him?(44,12) to step along. By(616,10)
anchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and
he handles it about right(189,9)Quohog, or whatever your name is, did
you ever stand in the h(460,9)whale-boat? did (48,11)rike a
fish?”

Without saying a word(1238,10), in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
(1918,14)from thence into the bows of one(1392,8)(166,10)s
hangi(895,8)e side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—

“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? Y(42,10)? well,
spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he
darted the iron right over ol(1963,8)’s broad brim, clean across the
ship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.

“Now(1718,8)(513,10)quietly hauling(621,8)line, “spos-ee him whale-e
eye; why, dad whale dead.”

“Quick, Bildad(1828,8)Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
vicinity(1975,8)flying(916,8), had retreated towards the cabin
gangway. (140,8)I say, you(151,8) and get the ship’s(1126,9)We must
have Hedgeho(1770,8) I mean(966,9)in(752,8)our boats. Look ye,
(1004,8)we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was
given(1173,10)eer ye(477,9)Nantucket.”

So down we went(926,10)cabin, and to my great joy(1977,10)was soon
enrolled among the sam(297,9)company to which I myself belonged.

When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess(1373,8) there don’t know
how to write, does he?(1427,16)blast ye! dost thou sign thy name
or make thy mark?”

But at this question(1376,12)who had twice or thrice before taken
part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but(1138,8)the
offered pen, copied upon(1858,10),(1608,8)proper place, an exact
counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattoo(101,8)his arm; so
that through Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touch(1506,8)appellative, it stood something like(1504,9)Quohog. his X mark.

Meanwhile(123,9)Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing(1816,10)
and at last rising solemnly and fumb(1328,12)huge pockets of his
broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tract(1497,8)electing one
entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in
(2033,8)’s hands(1141,8)en grasping them(1940,8) book with both his,
looked(326,11)into his eye(1683,8)aid, “Son of darkness, I must do
my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for
the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,
(1216,8)sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial
bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell(355,9) hideous dragon; turn from the
wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer
clear(1840,9)iery pit!”

S(827,9)of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language,
heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.

“Avast(1853,8)a(13,12)(1930,9)vast now spoiling our(1773,11),”
cried Peleg. “Pious(1806,11)s never make good voyagers—it takes the
shark(1847,8)’em; no(1877,12)is worth a straw who aint pretty
sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out
of all(1977,10)(883,9)Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never
came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he
shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case
he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”

“Peleg! Peleg!” sai(623,8), lifting(1098,9) and(1191,8)“thou thyself,
as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what
it is to have the(229,9)death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this
ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own hear(127,8). Tell me, when this
same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on
Japan, that same voyage(100,8)ou went mate wit(1943,10)Ahab, did’st
thou not think of Death(1555,9)Judgment then?”

“Hear him, hear him now,” (946,11), marching across the cabin, and
thrus(512,9)hands far down(1634,10)pockets,—“(107,8), all of ye.
T(179,8)that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death
(235,22) What? With all(408,13)making such an
everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over
us, fore and aft. (223,9)(402,28) No! no time to
think about Death then. Life was what(523,13) and I was thinking
of; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-mast(22,9)get into the
nearest port; that(132,10)(115,14) of.”

Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where
we followed him(1469,8)he stood, very quietly overlooking some
sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now(2045,8)n he
stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
otherwise might have been wasted.


CHAPTER 19. The Prophet.

“Shipmates, have ye shippe(1103,10)ship?”

Queequeg and I had just left th(1194,8), and were sauntering(1601,10)
the water, for the(906,8)each occupied with his own(930,8)s(1310,9)e
above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but
shabbily apparelled in faded ja(1993,9)patched trowsers; a rag of a
black handkerchief inve(1278,10)neck. A confluent small-pox had in all
directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated
ribbed bed of a torrent(377,10) rushing waters(625,11)dried up.

“H(589,18)her?” he repeated.

“You mean(1404,10)(582,8)I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a little
more time for an uninterrupted look at him.

“Aye,(689,11)—(742,9) there,” he said, drawing back his whole arm,(1555,8)n rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed
bayonet of his pointed finger darted full(651,8)object.

“Yes(280,11)“we have just signed the articles.”

“Anything down there about your souls?”

“About what?”

“Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any(304,10) quickly. “No matter though,
I know many chaps that(77,17)—good luck to ’em;(1749,8)y are
all the better off for it. A soul’s a sort of a fifth wheel to a
wagon.”

“What are you jabbering about, shipmate?(639,8).

“_He’s_ got enough,(224,8) to make up for all deficiencies of that
sort in other chaps,” abruptly said the(1216,11)placing a nervous
emphasis upon the word _he_.

“(1450,8)(546,12)let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from
somewhere; he’s talk(282,9) something and somebody we don’t know.”

“Stop!” crie(211,14). “Ye said true—ye(596,9)seen Old Thunder
yet(1691,9)?”

“Who’s(35,12)(417,9), again rivet(1602,8)the insane earnestness
of his manner.

“Captain Ahab(542,9)! the captain of our ship(1088,12)?”(1108,8)among some of us old sailo(489,8) he goes by that name. Ye
(257,13)him (249,17)No, w(298,9). He’s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
all right again(1809,8)long.”

“A(32,26)!” laugh(463,15), with a solemnly
derisive(904,9)laugh. “Look ye; when (372,12) is (155,9), then
this left arm of mine(201,8)(46,10); not before(985,10)do you know about him?(31,10)id they _tell_ you(39,11) Say that!”

“They didn’t tell much of a(1362,8)(97,9); only I’ve heard that he’s
a good whale-hun(411,9)a good(616,9)to his crew.”

“That’s true, t(13,10)—yes, both true enough. But you must jump when
he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go—(106,8)(1118,8)with
(807,13) But no(259,12)that thing(1503,8)ppened to him off
Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
(120,19)deadly skrimmage(1904,10)Spaniard afore the altar
in Santa?—heard(206,19), eh? N(230,15)e silver
calabash he spat into? An(76,16)his losing his leg last
voyage, according to the prophecy. Didn’t ye hear a word(139,10)m
matters(1425,9)thing more(190,8), I don’t think ye did; how could ye?
Who knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve
heard tell(304,11)leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye ha(820,9)of
that, I dare say. Oh yes, _that_ every one knows a’most—I mean they
know he’s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.”

“My friend(1870,12)what all this gibberish of yours is about, I
(1815,10), and(394,9)much care; for it seems to me tha(967,11)be
a little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of(1383,13),
of that ship there(1741,12), then let me tell you, that I know all
(472,11)oss of(725,8).”

“_All_ about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”

“Pretty sure.”

With finger pointed and eye levelled at(175,16) beggar-like
(1685,8) stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
little, turned and said:—“Ye’ve shipped(1953,10) Names down on the
papers? Well, well, what’s signed, i(11,8); and(30,8)to be, will
be(687,8)en again, perhaps it won’t be, after all. Anyhow, it’s all
fixed and arranged a’ready;(1075,9) sailors or other must go with him,
I suppose; as well these as any(56,8)en, God pity ’em! Morning to ye,
shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I’m sorry I stopped
ye.”

“Look here,(938,19)if you have(1967,10)important to tell
us, out with it; b(848,14)only trying to bamboozle us,(885,8)
mistaken in your game;(1971,8)all I have to say.”

“And it’s said very well(1066,8)like to(1529,8)chap talk up that way;
(1014,8)just the man for him—the likes of ye.(398,15) (398,10)
morning! Oh! when ye get(1064,9)ell ’em I’ve concluded not to make one
of ’em.”

“Ah, my dear fellow, you can’t fool us(203,9)—(27,17). It
is the easiest thing(1279,8)world for a man to look as if he had a
great secret in him.”

“(269,25)(667,8)(38,13)it is(1545,9). “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this crazy
man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?”

“Elijah.”

Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting(1045,8)each
other’s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was
nothing but a humbug,(791,12)e a bugbear. But we had not gone
(1212,8)above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so(1807,8)
said (277,8)to(514,9)(1808,8)being behind, but passed on with my
comrade, anxious to see whether the (1749,9)would turn the same corner
that we did. He did(1595,11)it seemed to me(470,12) dogg(279,8)b(1284,8)what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This
circumstance, coupled(1605,8)s ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,
shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments
and half-apprehensions, and all connect(162,8)the Pequod; and Captain
Ahab(1929,9) leg(1113,8)lost(25,10)Cape Horn fi(23,11)silver
calabash(2029,10)(96,8) Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship
the day previous(152,10)prediction of the squaw Tistig(526,9)
voyage(924,8)bound ourselves to sail; and(930,11)other shadowy
things.

I was resolved to satisfy myself(712,11)(1131,10)Elijah was really
(644,10) or not, an(405,9)(651,10)crossed the way with(1401,10)
and on that side of it retraced our steps. B(1050,10)(917,9),
without seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and
finally as(886,16), I pronounced him in my heart,(1363,9).


CHAPTER 20. All Astir.

A day or two passed,(999,8)re was great activity aboard(731,11).
Not only were the(1533,9)(1204,8)mended, but new sails were coming on
board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything
betoken(1644,8)(745,8)’s preparations were hur(1646,9)a close.
(838,14)seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam
keeping a sharp look-out(1829,8)e hands: Bildad did all the purchasing
and providing (203,8)tore(933,11)men employed in the hold and on
the(304,8) were working till long after night-fall.

On (1048,8)(1768,10)(1679,8)’s signing the articles, word was given at
(214,8)inns wh(543,8)ship’s company were stopping,(439,9)ir chests
must be on board before night,(1605,8)re was no telling how soon the
vessel might be sailing. S(1898,11)and I got down our traps,
resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But(1834,8)s they
always give very long(1043,8)in these cases(903,9) ship did not sail
for several days. But no wonder;(958,11)a good deal to be done, and
there i(307,17)many things to be thought of,(380,8)(1756,10)
was fully equipped.

Every one knows what a multitude of things—beds, sauce-pans, knives and
forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers,(1806,10)not, are
indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,
which necessitates a three-years’(70,13)(1003,10)wide ocean, far
from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, ba(209,10)bankers. And
though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means
to the same extent as(245,10)emen. For besides the great length of
the(291,8) voyage, the numerous(1054,9) peculiar(384,8)prosecution
of the fishery(762,10)impossibility of replacing them(1300,8)remote
harbors usually frequented, it (1093,8)remembered, that of all ships,
(206,9)essels are the most exposed to accidents(64,8)kinds, and
especially(622,8)destruction and loss of the ver(879,9)upon which
the succe(42,11)oyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare
spa(789,8)spare lines and harpoon(30,13)(1864,10)s, almost, but
a spare (1821,8)and duplicate ship.

At the period of our arrival(1729,8)Island, the heaviest storage of the
Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,
fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as(1613,8)hinted, for some time
(1354,12)continual fetching and carrying(1695,10)of divers odds and
ends(1267,10), both large and small.

Chief among those who did this(120,23)was(408,8)
Bildad’s sister, a lean old lady of a(578,8)termined and indefatigable
spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if _she_
could help it, nothing should be found wanting in(1625,11), after
once fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come(399,10)with a
jar of pickles for the steward’s pantry; another time with a bunch of
quill(62,10)chief mate’s desk, where he kept his log; a third time
with a roll of flannel(148,10)mall of some one’s rheumatic back.
Never did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity—Aunt
Charity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity(664,9)
charitable Aunt(101,8) bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn
her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,
and consolation to all(927,10)a ship in which her beloved brother
Bildad was concerned, and(55,10)she herself owned a score or two of
well-saved dollars.

But it was startl(721,9)e this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on
board, as she did the last day,(698,8)long oil-ladle in one hand, and
a still longer(1998,9)lance(912,8)other. Nor was Bildad himself nor
(1560,8)Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him
a long list(1824,8)articles need(390,8)at every fresh(1637,8), down
went his mark opposite that(78,8) upon the paper. Every once in a
while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring(1771,8)men
down the hatchways(39,10)up to the riggers(57,9)ast-head, and
then concluded by(105,9)back into his wigwam.

During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the
craft, and as often I ask(435,9)(498,8)Ahab, and how he was, and
when he was going to(1435,15)his ship. To these questions they
would answer, that(83,9)etting(1269,8)and better, and was expected
aboard every day; meantime, the two captains,(709,8)nd(689,9)could
attend to everything necessary to fit the vess(1488,11)voyage. If I
had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly
in my(1317,8)hat I did but half fancy being committed this way to so
long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the
absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out(901,10)open
sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he
be already involved(1225,8)matter, he insensibly strives to cover up
his suspicions even from(1270,8). And much(341,10)it was with me. I
said nothing, and tried to think(28,8).

At las(1562,9)given out that some time next day(337,10)would
certainly sail. So next morning(1012,17)took a very early
start.


CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.

It was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
drew nigh the wharf.

“There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I to
(1246,8), “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess; come
on!”

“Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner(1518,8)sa(418,8)coming close
behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating
(1898,8)between us, stood stooping forward a little,(1980,8)uncertain
twilight, strangely peering from(1558,10)to me. It was Elijah.

“Going aboard?”

“Hands off, will you(394,9).

“Lookee here(418,8)(413,10)shaking(850,8), “go ’way!”

“Ain’t g(114,11), then?”

“Yes, we a(88,10)I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you
know, Mr. Elijah,(1350,8)consider you(334,9) impertinent?”

“No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of tha(658,9)(95,8)slowly and
wonderingly look(385,9)me to(290,11)with the most unaccountable
glances.

“Elijah(265,12)you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We
are(1959,10)the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be
detained.”

“Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”

“He’s cracked(1200,10)(481,12)come on.”

“Holloa(924,9)stationary(466,9)hailing us(1145,8) had removed a few
paces.

“Never mind him(599,12)(1104,10)(128,11)But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
(1014,8), said—“Did ye see anything(543,9)like men(418,9)wards that
ship a while ago?”

Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes,
I thought I did see four or five men; bu(1720,9)too dim to be sure.”

“Very dim, v(10,8)(800,13). “Morning to ye.”

Once more we quitted him; but o(30,9)he came softly after us; and
touching my(1383,9)(422,8)said, “See if you can find ’em now, will
ye?

“Find who?”

(174,14)!(1894,8) to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off. “Oh! I
was(883,10)warn ye against—but n(660,9),(12,11)—it’s all one,
all(1517,8)family too;—sharp frost this(164,8), ain’t it? Good-bye to
ye. Shan’t see(138,9) very soon(1827,11)unless it’s before the
Grand Jury.” And(1217,9)se(984,8) words he finally departed, leaving
me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.

At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound
quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the
hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Go(2012,11)
to the forecastle(190,11)the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a
light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a
tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The(410,9)est slumber
slept upon him.

“Those sailors we saw(1620,11) where can they have gone to?(1865,9)
(1950,8)dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the
wharf(1741,10) had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I
would have(1424,9)myself to have been optically deceived in that
matter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable(1573,9). But I
beat the thing down; and(1253,8)arking(292,12), jocularly hinted to
(273,9)that perhaps(1954,8)best sit up(1091,9) body; telling him to
establish himself accordingly. He put(1913,10)upon(448,12)’s rear,
as though feeling if(1747,8)soft enough; and then, without more ado,
sat quietly down there.

“Gracious!(642,11)don’t sit there(1808,8)I.

“Oh! perry dood seat(1840,8)(707,10)“my country way; won’t hurt him
face.”

“Face!(725,9) “call th(1340,8)ace? very benevolent countenance then;
but how hard he breathes, he’s heaving(392,8); get of(764,11), you
are heavy, it’s grind(563,8)fac(1217,9)poor. G(70,16)! Look,
he’ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”
(630,10)removed(566,9)to just beyond the head(1357,9)(715,8)and
lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat(1060,8)feet. We kept the pipe passing
over(808,14)from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon(915,9)ing
him(1321,8)broken fashion(1139,11)gave me to understan(1195,8)in his
land, owing(125,8)absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,
chiefs, and great people generally(1154,8)n the custom of fattening
som(1733,9)lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house
comfortably(1276,8) respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy
fellows, and lay them round(187,8)piers and alcoves. Besides, it was
very convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs
which are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief
ca(1332,8)s attendant, and desir(1360,10) make a settee of(1367,8)
under a spreading tree,(1466,9)in some damp marshy place.

While narrating these things, every time(1830,10)r(1727,8)the(868,9)
from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it (864,16)’s head.

“What’s that for(1951,10)?”

“Perry easy, kill-e; o(1425,9)easy!”

He was going on with some wild reminiscences about(1073,13)-pipe,
which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his fo(911,9)othed
his soul, when we were directly attracted(1116,8)sleeping rigger. The
strong vapor now completely fill(2010,8)con(79,8)hole, it began to
tell upon him. H(1578,9)d with a sort of muffledness; then seemed
trouble(876,9)nose; then revolved over once or twic(34,8)sat up and
rubbed his eyes.

“Holloa!”(1730,11)d at last, “who be ye smokers?”

“Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”

“Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain
came aboard last night.”

“What(40,8)?—Ahab?”

“Who but him indeed?”

I(681,11)to ask him some further(1620,9)s concerning Ahab(593,9)
heard a noise on deck(339,11) Starbuck’s astir,” said the(614,9)“He’s a lively chief mate,
that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so
saying he went(169,8), and we followed.

It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and
threes;(227,11)s bestirred themselv(34,8)mates were actively
engaged; and several(1790,8)shore(1858,8)were busy in bringing various
last things(170,9). Meanwhil(596,9) Ahab remained invisibly
enshrined within his cabin.


CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.

At length, towards noon, upon the final dismiss(224,12)ip’s
riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and
(57,10)ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with
her last gift—a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her
brother-in-law(702,8)spare Bible for the steward—after all this, the
two(1023,8)s, Peleg and Bildad, issued(256,10)cabin, and turning to
the(858,12) Peleg said:

“Now, Mr.(944,9), are you sure everything is right?(576,14)is
all ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
Well, call all hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”

“No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said
(338,8)“but away with thee, friend(289,12)nd do our bidding.”

How now! Here(750,10)very point of starting(512,9)voyage,(1511,9)(486,10)(933,8)Bildad we(1592,10)t(1852,8)high hand on the
quarter-deck, just as if they we(388,9)joint-commanders at sea, as
well as to all appearances in port. And, as for(1103,13), no sign
of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was(2016,8)cabin. But
then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in
getting(1123,9) under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,
as tha(1572,8)t at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he
(63,8)yet completely recovered—so(281,10)—therefor(545,10) Ahab
stayed below. And(1082,9) seemed natural enough; especially (362,9)
merchant service many captains never show(1725,11)(2028,8) for a
considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the
cabin table, having a farewell merry-making(919,9)ir shore friends,
before they quit(497,10)for good(980,9) pilot.

But there(470,9)much chance to think(170,9) matter,(757,12)
Peleg was now all alive. He(396,8)to do most(1996,8)talking and
commanding, and not Bildad.

“Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at
the main-mast. “(1521,14)drive(1375,8).”

“Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this
whalebone marquee wa(597,8)pitched except(1111,8); and on board the
Pequod, for thirty years, the order to s(177,15)was well known
to be(186,10)thing to(678,22).

“Ma(1164,8)pstan! Blood and thunder!—jump(276,16)command, and
the crew spra(1524,11)handspikes.

Now in (1191,8)(1182,13)the station generally occupied by(1126,10)
is the forward par(622,9)ship. And here (1773,8)who, with Peleg, be
it known, in addition to his other officers, was one(725,8)licensed
pilots(748,8)port—he being suspected to have got himself made a(210,8)n(480,11)ave the Nantucket pilot-fee(1704,8)(1506,8)s he was
concerned in, for he(640,9)loted any other craft—(284,8)I say, might
now(1724,8) actively engaged in looking(1064,10)bows(2018,8)
approaching(1287,9)and at intervals singing what(1475,8)a dismal stave
of psalmody, to chee(592,11) at the windlass, who roared forth some
sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good
will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that
no profane songs would be allowe(1034,14) (1034,8)particularl(2017,13)(2008,11); and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice
copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.

Meantime, overseeing the other(888,17)(1977,10)Peleg ripped
and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he
would sink(1771,10)(1797,10) anchor c(340,8)got up; involuntarily I
paused on my(1178,10), and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of
the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for
a pilot. I was comforting myself, however,(1998,10)(276,8)that in
pious(632,8)might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundr(419,8)eventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,
and turning round, was horrified(950,8)apparition of(563,15)in
the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my
first kick.

“Is th(1078,8)ay they heave(654,9)archant service?” he roared.
“Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye
(45,8)I say, all of ye—spring! Quohog!(86,9)thou chap(515,10)red
whiskers(127,8) there, Scotch-cap(153,10)thou green pants. (204,8)I
(134,14), and(82,8)your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved
along(1422,15)here and there us(449,12)very freely, while
imperturbabl(1972,8) kept leading off with his(1563,9). Thinks I,
(1146,14)must have been drinking something to-day.

At last(1096,12)was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It
was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into
night, w(962,8)ourselves(1299,8)broad upon(1792,8)try ocean, whose
freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of
teeth(1223,8)bulwarks glistened(1476,10)onlight; and like the white
ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from
the bows.

Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as
the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent(1766,8)vering
frost all over her,(754,8) winds howled(22,10)cordage rang, his
steady notes were heard,—


_“Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living
green. So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.”_



Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They
were full of hope and fruition. S(1694,8)this frigid winter night(1564,8)boisterous Atlantic(1756,11)my wet feet and wetter jacket, there
was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and
meads and glades so eternally vernal,(1652,10)grass shot up by th(1550,10)untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer(1199,11)we gained such an offing(116,11)two pilots were needed no
longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
alongside.

It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and(1505,8)were affected
at this juncture, especially (1502,8)Bildad. For loath to depart, yet;
very(27,10)leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a
voyage—beyond both stormy Capes;(72,8)in which some thousands of his
hard earned dollars were invested(73,8),(74,10)an old shipmate
sailed as captain; a man(1555,8)as old as he, once more starting to
encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw;(346,10)say good-bye to
a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,—poor ol(505,8)
lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down(1445,9)
cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and
looked to windward; (20,9)wards the wide and endless waters, only
bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents(99,20)
lan(124,10)aloft(138,9)right and le(23,11)everywhere and
nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,
convulsively grasped stout Peleg(223,8)hand, and holding up a lantern,
for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,
“Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”

As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
his(29,10)y, there was a tear twinkling(204,8)eye, when the(271,8)
came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from (731,9)deck—now
a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.

But,(531,10)he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about
him,—“(1420,14)—come,(1203,13), we must go. Back the main-yard
there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close (1638,9), now! Careful,
careful!—come, Bildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye,(291,9)—luck to
ye, Mr. Stubb(22,8) (22,8)Flask—(1280,9)and good (40,10)
all—and this day three years I’ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in
old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”

“God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,” murmured old
(292,8)almost incoherently. “I hope ye(180,9)fine weather now, so
that(1933,9)Ahab may soon be moving among ye—a pleasant sun is all he
needs, and(114,12)plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be(515,8)(39,8)hunt, ye mates. Don’t stave the boats needlessly, ye
harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.
within the year(121,8)forget your prayers, either. Mr.(943,11)mind
that cooper don’t waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in
the green locker! Don’t whale it too much a’ Lord’s days, men; but
don’t miss a fair chance either, that’s rejecting Heaven’s good gifts.
Have an eye to the molasses tierc(890,12); it was(1290,10)leaky, I
thought. If ye touch at the islands(941,11), beware of fornication.
Good-bye, (975,8)(283,8)keep that cheese too long down(606,9)old,
(440,12); it’ll spoil. Be (657,8)with the butter—twenty cents the
pound it was, and mind ye, if—”

“Come, come,(878,9)Bildad; stop palavering,—away!” and(123,8)at,
Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into(809,9).

Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate(209,10)lone
Atlantic.


CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.

Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
mariner, encountered in New Bedford(707,9)nn.

When on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive
bows(457,10)cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her
helm but(243,11)! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous
voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another
tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest
things are e(835,8)unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;
this six-inch(608,8) is the stoneless grave of(623,11). Let me only
say that it far(401,8)him as(1146,10)storm-tossed ship, that
miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give
succor; t(33,8)is pitiful;(1970,8)(24,8)safety, comfort,
hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all(1644,8)kind to our
mortalities. But in that gale,(152,9), the land, is(858,9)p’s
direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; on(1655,8)of land,
though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and
through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,
fights ’gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks
all the lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly
rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!

Know ye now,(1383,11)? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is bu(1414,8)trepid
effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the
wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the
treacherous, slavish shore?

But as in(416,15)lone resides highest truth, shoreless,
indefinite as God—so, better is it to perish(858,9)howling infinite,
than be ingloriously dashed upon(1106,8), even if that were safety! For
worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the
terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, t(12,11)O
(1766,12)Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy
ocean-perishing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!


CHAPTER 24. The Advocate.

As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;
and as(33,25) has somehow come to be regarded among
landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I
am all anxiety to convince ye, ye (105,8),(892,8)injustice hereby
done to us hunter(240,9)es.

In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
the fact, that among people at large, the(339,21)is not
accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a
stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,
i(1987,8)but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were
he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation
of the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale
Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure(1790,8)(519,8)
pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.

Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us
whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a
butchering sort of(1012,9); and that when actively engaged therein, we
are surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is
true. But butchers, also, and(20,9)(1860,8)bloodiest badge have been
all Martial Commanders whom(344,11)invariably delights to honor. And
as for the matter(1983,8)alleged uncleanl(1317,9)our(1333,9), ye
shall soon b(636,8)t(874,8)certain facts hitherto pretty(830,8)ly
unknown, and which,(1804,10)whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm
whale-ship at leas(1160,8)the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But
even granti(60,8)harge in question to be true; what disordered
slippery decks of a (157,12)re comparable(1044,8)unspeakable
carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to
drink in all ladies’ plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much
enhances the popular conceit(1643,8)soldier’s(1413,11); let me assure
ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would
quickly recoil at the apparit(299,9)e sperm whale’s vast tail,
fanning into eddies the air over his head. For(1648,10)the
comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked(45,9)and
wonders of God!

But, though(1296,11)scouts at us whale(1975,8), yet does it
unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
adoration! for(2019,8)all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn
round the globe, burn, as before(673,10)hrines, to our glory!

But look at this(1161,8)in other lights; weigh it(722,8)sorts of
scales; see what we (1598,8) are, and(1341,10).

Why did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admiral(1426,8)ir whaling
fleets? (75,8)Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit
out(83,8) ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some
score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket(192,9)
Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her(356,10)in bounties
upwards of £1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it t(433,16)of
America now outnumber(663,9)res(1151,9)banded(138,13)(1791,9);
sail a navy of (155,11)seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen
thousand men; yearly consuming 4(227,8) of dollars; the ships worth,
at the time of sailing, $20(292,8)! and every year import(1203,9)our
harbors a well reaped harvest of $7(371,8). H(359,9)all this, if
there be not something puissant in(740,8)?

But this is not the half; look again.

I(1477,8)assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty
years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken
in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of(1055,8). One way
and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
continuously momentous in their sequential issues, tha(1117,10)may
well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring(148,11)
pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to
catalogue(1643,8)se things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past
the whale-ship has b(1211,8)pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and
least known part(1516,8) earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes
which had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. I(1272,9)n and European men-of-war now(783,9)ly ride in once savage(1059,8), let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the
(334,10)(867,8)originally showed them the way, and first interpreted
(1605,11)m and th(161,8)s. They may celebrate as they will the
heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cook(12,8)Krusensterns; but I
say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out(1825,13),
that were as great, and greater than(142,10) and(144,17).
For(939,11)uccourless empty-handedness, they,(1737,8)heathenish
sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javeli(2040,8)s,
battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines
and muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such a
flourish of(1973,8)old South Sea Voyages, tho(1055,9) were but the
life-time commonplaces of our heroic(458,10)ers. Often, adventur(951,9)(920,10)dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted
unworthy of being set down(453,8)ship’s common log. Ah, the world! Oh,

Until (1248,9) fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
scarcely any intercours(39,15) was carried on (955,8)Europe

coast. It was(212,10)man who first broke through the jealous policy
of the(110,9)crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted,
it might be distinctly shown how from thos(168,8)en at last eventuated
the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia(82,8)e yoke of Old Spain,(351,9)establishment(1665,9)ternal democracy in those parts.

That great America(383,8)other sid(434,9)sphere, Australia, was
given(1560,8)enlightened worl(1123,9)(436,8). After its first
blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all(147,8)hips long shunned
those shores as pestiferously barbarous;(1018,8)(2038,12)touched
there. T(30,14)is the true mother of that now mighty colony.
Moreover(1407,9)infanc(1823,8) first(320,10)n settlement, the
emigrants were several times saved from starvation(1475,10)nevolent

The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do
commercial homage(551,8)(384,10), that cleared the way for the
missionary (1098,8)merchant, and in many case(1160,10)the primitiv(69,11)ies to their first destinations. If that double-bolted land,
Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it(563,8)(611,11)alone to whom
the credit will be due; for already she i(1290,9)threshold.

But if(2016,9)face(407,8)this, you still declare that whaling has no

shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet

CHAPTER 25. Postscript.

In behalf(1903,8)(967,11)whaling, I would fain advance naught but
substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
should wholly suppress a not(555,12)e surmise, which might tell
eloquently(1514,10)cause—such(115,12), would he not be
blameworthy?

It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even
modern ones, a certain curious(1520,8) of seasoning them for their
functions is gone through. T(1457,8)a saltcellar of state, so called,
and there may be a casto(47,10). How they use the salt,
precisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is
solemnly oiled at his(321,11), even as a head of salad. Can it be,
though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run
well, as(63,13)machinery? Mu(587,9)be ruminated here,
concer(420,8) essential(1782,12)this regal(1997,8), because in
common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints
his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man
who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally,(1739,10)has probably got a
quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t amount to
much(1909,8)totality.

But the only thing to be consider(410,8) is this—what kind of oil is
used at(944,11)(703,10)ly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar
(18,9)(820,8)(34,8)bear’s(50,10)train(65,10)cod-liver oil.
What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,
unpolluted(997,8)the sweetest of all oils?

Think(527,8), ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your(1230,10)
queens with(1266,12)stuff!(1620,12)6. Knights and Squires.

The chief mate(1634,8)Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an
icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being
hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indi(72,8)live blood
would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time
of(867,9)drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which
his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those
(27,12)dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his
thinness, so to speak(436,9)no more the token of wasting anxieties
and cares, than it(501,8)the indic(1984,9)any bodily blight. It was
merely the condens(2037,9)the man(649,9)by no means ill-looking;
quite(67,8)trary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and
closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,
like a revivified Egyptian, thi(909,10)(799,8)prepar(795,13)for
long ages to come, an(832,12)always, as now; for be it Polar snow
or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, hi(1994,11)vitality was
warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed
to see there the yet lingering images(832,10)thousand-fold perils he
had calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfa(1203,8)whose life
for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame
chapter of sounds. Yet, for(912,9)hardy sobriety and fortitude, there
were certain qualities(2029,8)which at times affected, and(1191,8)
cases(1394,13)nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly
conscientious for a sea(1512,9)endu(765,8)a deep natural reverence,
the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline
him to superstition; but to that sort of(34,13), which(272,9)organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And
if(448,10)these things bent the welded iron(300,8)soul, much more
did his far-away domestic memorie(358,9)young Cape wife and child,
tend to bend him still more from the original rugged(449,12)nature,
and open(68,11)fur(352,8)those latent influences which,(693,9)honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil da(443,8) often
evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitud(1125,8)e fishery. “I
will have no man in my boat,” said(1466,9), “who is not afraid of a
whale.” By(1898,8)e(1809,9)o mean, not only that(1155,10)reliable and
useful courage was that(1035,8)rises(431,10)fair estim(1848,12)
encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more
dangerous comrade than a coward.

“Aye, aye(292,10)ubb, the second mate, “(317,10)there, is as
careful a man as you’ll find anywhere in this(433,9)” But we shall
ere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a
man like(195,8)or almost any other whale hunter.

(1995,9)was no crusader after perils;(1480,8)(462,12)not a
(1072,9); but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon
all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in
this bus(1456,9)whaling,(647,13)one(830,8)great staple outfits
of the ship, like her beef and her bread(1868,10)to be foolishly
wasted. W(1570,9)he had no fancy for lowering for whales after
sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much(44,8)ed
(43,12)him. For,(320,8)(1036,11)I am (678,13)critical
ocean to kill(166,8)for my living(263,16)killed by them for
theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so(64,8)(665,10)ell knew.
What doom was his own father’s? Where,(1341,8)bottomless deeps, could
he find the torn limb(2015,9)brother?

With(1688,10)like these in(719,9), moreover, given to a certain
(2015,11)usness, as has been said; the(1319,9)of this(254,11)hich
could, nevertheless,(1715,8)lourish, must indeed have been extreme. But
it(955,9)in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; (120,14)nature
(1597,8)se things should fail in latently engendering an element in
him,(1939,8)under suitable circumstances, would break out from its
confinement, and burn all his(1728,9)up. And brave as he might be, it
(1761,9)sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men(197,8)
while generally abiding firm(729,8)conflict with seas, or winds, or
whales, or any(1261,8)ordinary irrational horrors(1296,8)world, yet
cannot withstand those more terrific, becau(23,8)spiritual terrors,
which sometimes menace you(2044,10)concentrating brow of an enraged
and mighty man.

But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance,(48,8)plete
abasement of poor(1298,9)’s fortitude, scarc(494,8)I have the heart
to write it; for it is(1801,9)most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose
the fall of valour(1223,8)soul. Men may seem detestable as joint
stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
men may have mean and meagre faces; but man(1386,9)ideal, is so noble
and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any
ignominious blemish in him(926,9)fellow(1081,9)run to throw their
costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so
far(25,8)us, that it remains intact though all the outer character
seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a
valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at(372,8)shameful sight,
(771,8)ly stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But
this august dignity I treat of, is not the(31,9)of kings and robes,
but that abounding(78,9)which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt
see it shining(1320,8)arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that
democratic(131,14), on all hands, radiates without end from God;
Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all(140,8)cy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!

If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
hereafter ascribe high qualities,(738,8)dark; weave round them tragic
graces; if even the most mournful, perchance(29,10)abased, among
them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if(211,9)touch that workman’s arm with some ethereal light(62,12) spread a
rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then(830,9)all mortal critics
bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality,(774,10)t(141,8)one
royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! B(114,22)
great (757,11)God! who didst not refuse(358,8)swart convict,
Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou(80,11)clothe with doubly
hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old
Cervantes(113,17)pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who
didst hurl him upon a war-horse;(281,11)thunder him higher than a
throne!(250,9), in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest
Thy selectest champions(184,10)kingly commons; (595,19)O
God!


CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.

Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an
indifferent air; and while engaged(1560,8)most imminent crisis of the
chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner(106,8)
for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided(1123,9)
whale-boat as if(1352,10)deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his
crew all invited guests(479,10)s particular about the comfortable
arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about
the snugness(70,8)box. When clo(1130,10)whale,(1992,8)very
death-lock(118,8)fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and
off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum(406,10)old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with(1786,10)exasperated
monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death
into an easy chair. What he thought(45,9) itself, there is no
telling. Whether he ever(62,12)it at all, might be a question;
but, if(59,9)did (2007,8)o cast his mind that way after a
(609,11)(693,9)no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a
sort of call(655,8)watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,
about something(1911,8)(514,8)find out when he obeyed the order, and
not sooner.

What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such(463,8)-going,
unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off(618,10)burden of life in a
world full of grave pedlars, all bowed(2019,8)ground(700,9)ir packs;
what helped to bring(1069,9)at almost impious g(1266,9) of his; that
thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black
little pipe was one(1161,8)regular feature(1127,9)face. You would
almost as soon have expected him to turn ou(1265,9)bunk without his
nose as(20,12) pipe. He kept a whole row of pip(625,8) ready
loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach(1399,8)hand; and, whenever
he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from
the(671,8)o the end(1505,8)chapter; then loading them again to be in
readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his
legs into his trowsers, he p(362,11)(35,10)mouth.

I say this continual smok(631,19)one cause, at least, of his
peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,
whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infecte(881,10) nameless
miseries(1892,8)numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in
tim(799,9)cholera, some people go about with a camphorated
handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal
tribulations, Stubb’s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of
disinfecting agent.

The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A
short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,
who somehow seem(1358,8)ink(542,8)e great leviathans had personally
and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it w(293,12) point of
honor with him, to destroy them(1077,9) encountered. So utterly lost
was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvel(682,8)ir majestic
bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
any possible danger from(196,10)(1166,8); that in his poor opinion,
the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or(1056,9)
water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small
application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This
ignorant, unconscious fearlessnes(1779,9)made him(153,10)waggish in
the matter of whales; he followed these fish(492,9)fun of(1119,10)
three years’ voyage round Cape Horn was(288,8)jolly joke that lasted
that length(275,8). As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought
nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly(70,8). Little Flask
was on(1328,9)wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They
called him King-Post on boar(1875,9)Pequod; because, in form, he could
be well liken(1110,8)e (1205,8)quare timber known by that name in
Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating sid(91,8)s
insert(371,8)it, serves to brace the ship(1541,9)the icy concussions
of those battering seas.

Now these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and(1510,8)were momentous men.
They(1306,8)who by universal prescription commanded thre(1823,8)
Pequod’s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which
Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the
whales,(271,13)(134,8) were as captains of companies. Or, being
armed with their long keen whaling spears, they(89,9)a picked trio
of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.

And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
Knight of old, is always ac(253,8)d by his boat-steerer or(171,11),
who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
and friendliness; it is therefore but meet,(1815,9)this place we set
down who(1173,11)’s(483,17), and to what(426,9) each of
them belonged.

First of all was Queequeg, whom (987,10)the chief mate, had selected
for his squire. But(74,9) is already known.

Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last
remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the
neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring
(924,11). In the(879,10)they usually go(1541,8)generic name of
Gay-Headers.(331,9)’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,
and black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in(1196,8)argeness, but
Antarctic(34,10)gli(1602,8)expression—all this sufficiently
proclaimed him an inheritor(2023,8)unvitiated blood (1706,9)proud
warrior hunters, who, in quest(2001,8)great New England moose, had
scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests(151,8)main. But no longer
snuffing(1113,8)trail(200,8)wild bea(68,11)woodland,(787,9) now
hunt(1182,10)wak(1796,8) great whale(137,9)sea; the unerring(1538,8)
(33,8)on fitly replacing the infallible arrow(81,9)ires. To look
at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have
credited the superstitions of som(225,9)earlier Puritans, and
half-believed this wil(1076,9)to be a son(565,8)Princ(311,9)Powers(272,8)Air(825,10) was Stubb the second mate’(1242,9)

Third among(1892,18)as Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
negro-savage,(1729,8)lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended
from his ea(2012,8)two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called
them ring-bolts, and would talk of secur(551,8)top-sail halyards to
them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been
anywhere(814,9)orld but in Africa,(1438,10), and the pagan harbors
most frequented by whalemen; and(115,8)now led for many years the bold
lif(940,9)fishery(1036,8)ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
manner of men the(326,9);(358,8)retained all his barbaric virtu(1506,8)erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six
feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at
him; and a white man standing before him seeme(39,10)flag come to
beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro,
(862,10)(943,8)was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a
chess-man beside him. As for the residu(1146,10)equod’s company, be it
said, that at the present day not one in two(1650,10)ny thousand men
before the mast employ(1595,10)American whal(658,9), ar(28,10)s
born, though pretty nearly(531,9)officers are. Herein it is the same
with(118,27) as (35,18)army and military
and merchant navies(950,10)engineering forces(244,16)
constructi(1550,10)(264,9)Canals and Railroads. The same, I say,
because(789,11)se cases the(1176,8)(350,9)liberally provides the
brains,(535,8)t(2038,10)rld as generously supply(1946,8)muscles. No
small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the
outward bound(1295,10) whalers(1275,9)ly touch to augment their crews
from(1793,8)dy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the
Greenland(125,9)sailing out of Hull or London, put in(807,8)Shetland
Islands, to receive the full complemen(373,8)ir crew. Upon the passage
homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,
but Islanders seem to make the best(1619,9). They were(873,11)
(63,10)in(1085,11), _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not
acknowledg(1974,8)common continent of men, but each(86,9)_ living on
a separate(58,14)his own. Yet now, federated along one keel,
what a set these (190,9) were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from
(1677,8)isles(1875,8)sea, and(1707,9)end(29,9)earth, accompanying
Old Ahab(338,14) to lay(909,10)’s grievances(1678,8)that bar
from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he
never did—oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim
(1609,9)forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;
prelusiv(1698,9)eternal time, when sent for,(1105,8)great quarter-deck
on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat(140,15) in
glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!


CHAPTER 28. Ahab.

For several days after leaving(1264,10), nothing above hatches was
seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the
watch(1713,8)for aught that could be seen(1451,8)contrary, they seemed
to be the only commander(777,10)hip; only they sometimes issued from
the cab(400,8)orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was
plain they but(141,9)d vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and
dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to
penetrate into the now sacred retrea(1894,9)cabin.

Every time I ascended(1834,8)deck from my watches below, I instantly
gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
disquietude touch(2033,8)unknown captain, now(1542,8)seclusion of the
sea, became almost a perturbation. This was(160,8)ly heightened at
times by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have(1372,8)conceived
of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was
almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicaliti(1617,8)at outlandish
prophe(576,9)wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
uneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look
about me(510,9)hip, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
emotions. For(876,8)the harpooneers, with(1504,11)bod(1748,8) crew,
were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than (1823,10)
tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me
acquainted with, still I ascribed this—and rightly(26,10)it—to the
fierce uniquenes(1362,9)very nature(541,9)wild Scandinavian vocation
in (468,8)had so abandonedly embarked. But(564,8)especially the
aspec(1198,9)three chief offic(1517,15), t(1674,8), which was
most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and
induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentmen(1383,9)voyage.
Three better, more likely sea-(211,9)and men, each in his own
different way,(1079,11)readily be found, and they were every one of
them Americans; a(2044,10)er, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being
Christmas whe(904,10) shot from out her harbor, for a space we had
biting Polar weather(1784,9)all the time running away from it to the
southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude(546,8)e sailed,
gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable
weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey
and gloomy enough morning(903,9)transition, when(1623,8)fair wind the
ship was rushing thr(1251,9)water(1679,8)vindictive sort of leaping
and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck(1623,8)call of
the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the
taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran(1664,11)on;
Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.

There(1615,8)no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor(1492,8)recovery from any. He looked like a man cut(726,11)the stake, when
the fire has overrunningly wasted(807,9)limbs without consuming them,
or tak(834,9)one particle(121,9)ir compacted aged robustness. His
whole high, broad form,(1913,8)made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
unalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out
from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his
tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared(1424,8)clothing, you
saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that
perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a
great tree,(1427,10)upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and
(572,8)wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from
top to bottom, er(1468,10)off into the soil,(1386,11)e tree still
greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or
whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could
certainly say. By some tacit consent,(1369,8)(267,8)voyage little or
no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once
Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,
superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did
Ahab become that way(398,8), and then it came(1363,8)m, not in the
fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this
wild hint(1434,8)inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman
insinuated(325,9)sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out
of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,
the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested
this old(231,8) with preternatural powers of discernment. So(525,8)
white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever(1888,15)hould be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to
pass, so he muttered—then, whoever(92,8)do that last office for the
dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.

So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me(780,9)
livid brand which streaked it, that(169,8) first few moments I hardly
no(941,13)a(1107,9)f this overbearing grimness was owing to the
barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had prev(514,9)me
to (1023,8)this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished
bone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye,(1168,8)dismasted off Japan,” said(824,9)(1281,16)once; “but like hi(71,12)craft, he shipped
another mast (1789,8)coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”

I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of
the Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,
there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so,(1939,9)
plank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elev(1360,8)d
holding by a shroud; (1047,14)tood erect, looking straight out
beyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. T(237,12)infinity of firmest
fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and
fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor
did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest
gestures and express(1579,9)y plainly showed the uneasy, if not
painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not
only that, but moody stricke(479,13)before them with a crucifixion
in his face; in(241,8) nameless regal(1247,13)dig(481,8)some
mighty woe.

Ere long, from his first visit(468,8)air, he withdrew into his cabin.
But after that morning(1168,9)every day visibl(904,9)crew; either
standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or
heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to
grow(1591,10)genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,
when(911,9) had sail(1504,8)home, nothing but the dead wintry
bleak(623,8)the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it
came to pass, that(1578,8)almost continually(500,11); but, as yet,
for all(64,9)said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he
seemed as unnecessary there as (1626,12). But (1505,10) was only
making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling
preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so
that (1599,10)little or(471,8), out of himself, to employ or excite
Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that
layer upon layer were pil(824,8)his brow, as ever all(67,8)choose
the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.

Nevertheless, e(1102,9)the warm, warbling persuasive(721,11)
pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him
(1211,9)mood. For, as (893,9)red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and
May, trip hom(1186,9)wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,
ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some
few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,
in the end,(1225,10)respond(1408,8)playful allurings(1944,10)irlish
air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,
which, in any (988,8)n, would have soon flowered out in a smile.


CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.

Some days elapsed, and ice(8,8)bergs all astern,(1118,12)now went
rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
perpetually reigns(1299,8)threshold(1489,8)eternal August(790,8)Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
up—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights(1513,8)haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely
pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted
suns! For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such wins(599,8)
and such seducing nights. But all the witcherie(848,10)unwaning
(1247,8)did not merely lend new spells and potencies(1165,8)outward
world. Inward they turn(1510,8)the soul, especially(1294,10)still mild
hours of eve came on; then,(366,8)shot her(571,8)s as the clear ice
most forms of noiseless twilights. And(285,8)se subtle agencies, more
and more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.

Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,
the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the
night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he(875,8)so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
were mor(1792,9)cabin, than from(21,10)(1604,11)nks. “It feels
like going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an
old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
grave-dug berth.”

So(1448,8) every twenty-four hours,(813,10)watch(967,8)e night were
set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumber(69,9)band below;
and when if a rope was to be haul(980,12)forecastle, the sailors
flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt
it to its place for fear of disturbing their(212,8)ing shipmates; when
this sort of steady quietud(502,8)begin to prevail, habitually, the
silent steersman would watch(664,10)-scuttle; and ere long the old
(56,10)emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled
way. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like
these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because
to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six in(702,8)his ivory
heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din(1741,9)bony
step(1105,8)heir dreams(85,17)on the crunching teeth of
sharks. But onc(2023,8)ood was on him too deep for common regardings;
and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measur(355,8)ship from
taffrail to mainmast, Stubb,(590,8) second mate, came up from below,
with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if
Captain Ahab was pleased to walk(1393,11), then, no one could say
nay; but there might be some way of muff(619,9)noise; hinting
something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow(1298,9)
insertion into it,(1348,8)ivory heel. Ah!(359,10)ou didst not know
Ahab then.

“Am I a cannon-ball(419,8)” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that
fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;
where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use y(1869,9)filling one at
last.—Down, dog, and kennel!”

Start(1197,11)unforseen concluding exclamation(1701,8)so suddenly
scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,
“I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half
like it, sir.”

“Avast! gritted Ahab(325,9)his set teeth, and violently moving away,
as if to avoid some passionate temptation.

“No, sir; not yet(572,8)Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be
called a dog(202,10)Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,
or I’ll clear the world of thee!”

As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors
in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.

“I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,”
muttere(366,9)as he found himself descend(1799,8)(2023,13). “It’s
very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go
b(1755,8)strike him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for
him? Yes,(777,8)s the thought coming up in me; but it would be the
first time I ever _did_ pray. It’s queer; (253,10); and he(28,8)
too; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about the queerest(1053,8) Stubb
ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is
he mad? Anyway there’s (1630,10)on his mind, as sure as(1719,8)ust be(1678,11)on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either,
more than three hours out(1683,8)twenty-fou(341,9) don’t sleep then.
Didn’t that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell(1644,8) of a morning he always
finds the(1429,8)’s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled(1888,10)sheets down(1568,8)foot(1921,9) coverlid almost tied into knots, and
the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on
it? A ho(587,9)! I guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a
conscience; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a
toothache. Well, well;(1026,9)know what it is, but the Lord keep me
from catching it. He’s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the
after hold for, every night, as(571,10) tells me he suspects; what’s
that for, I should like to know? Who’s made appointments with him in
the hold? Ai(700,9)queer, now? But(923,9)no telling, it’(675,9)
game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be
born(296,9) world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think
of it, that(1232,13)first thing babies do(819,8)at’s(741,10)
queer, too(195,11)but all things are(301,8)come to think of ’em.
But(134,9)gainst my principles. Think not, is my eleventh
commandment; and sleep when you can(52,8)twelfth—So h(390,9)again.
But how(1712,8) didn’t he call me a dog? blazes!(26,8)ed me ten times
a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that!_ He might as
well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he _did_ kick(42,9)I
didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback(748,8)s brow,(2048,8). It
(1709,8)like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I
don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of tha(1868,10)ha(623,8)
of turned me wrong side out. By(1162,9), I must have been dreaming,
though—How? how? how?—(1225,8)only way’s to stash it; s(563,12)to
(1640,8)again; and in the(1704,8), I’ll see how this plaguey juggling
thinks over by daylight.”


CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.

When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the
bulwarks;(1795,8)n, as(1670,10)usual(1277,10)of late, calling a
sailor(2036,8)watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also
his pipe. Lighting the pipe(1928,8)binnacle lamp and plan(43,9)stool
on the weather side(154,8)deck, he sat and smoked.

In old Norse times, the thrones(219,8)sea-loving Danish kings were
fabricated, saith tradition,(284,8)tusk(78,9)narwhale. How could
one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without
bethinking(428,8)the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan(443,8)plank,
and a king(249,11), and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.

Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth
in quick and constant puffs, which blew ba(888,8) into his face. “How
now,” he soliloquized at last, withdraw(625,8)tube, “this smoking no
longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go(1257,8) if thy charm be
gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and
ignorantly(161,9)to windward all the while;(27,12), and with
such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were
the strongest and fullest of troubl(1554,8)business(248,8)with this
pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white
vapors among(24,11) hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like
mine. I’ll smoke no more—”

He tossed the still lighted pipe into(1058,8). The fire hisse(1545,8)
waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe
made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced(982,10)s.(1603,12)1. Queen Mab.

Next(1704,8) Stubb accosted Flask.

“Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the(1977,8)’s
ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to
kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I(81,9)y leg right off! And
then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept
kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask—y(286,8)how
curious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow
seemed to be (1540,9)to myself, that after all, it was not much of an
insult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not
a real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between
a living thump and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the
hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than(66,13)a cane.
The(139,8)member—t(115,10)t(29,10)(320,8)(652,13). And
(311,8)(405,10)(1450,14), mind, while I was stubbing my silly
toes against that cursed(692,8)—so confoundedly contradictory was it
all,(126,16)I say, I was(578,21)(494,8)his leg
now, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes(560,14)it was only a
playful cudgelling—in fact(565,9)(82,8)(1560,9)he gave me—not a
base kick. Besid(115,16)look at it once; why, the end of it—the
foot part—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed
farmer(1226,10), _there’s_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is
whittled down to a point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the
dream, Flask. W(601,11)battering away at the(1272,11)(248,8)
badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the
shoulders, and slews me round. ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid!
man, bu(1276,8)frightened. Such a phiz! But,(1300,8), next moment I was
over the fright(126,9)m I a(123,12)I at last. ‘And what business
is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a
kick?’ By the lor(1194,10)I had no sooner said that, than he turned
round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he
had for a clout—what do you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his
stern(1210,8)ck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on
second thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’
said he, ‘w(23,9);’ and kept mu(772,8)it(1419,9)time(768,12)eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to
stop saying over his(150,12), (12,11)’ I(251,8) I might as
well fall to kicking(949,12) again. But I had only just lifted my
foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop(2047,10)ing!’ ‘Halloa,(796,8),
(2042,12)matter now(399,12)?’ ‘Look ye here(61,8)he; ‘let’s
argue the(1291,9)Captain Ahab(1350,8)ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’
says I—‘right _here_ it was.’ ‘Very good(128,10)—‘he used his ivory
leg(102,28) says I. ‘Well then(208,10), ‘wise
(459,8)hat have you to complain of? D(202,8) kick with right good
will? it(579,8)a common pitch pine leg(64,8)ed with, was it? No, you
wer(34,9)by a great man, and(1469,8)beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It’s
an honor; I consider it (24,8). Listen(706,12). In old England
(1696,13)lords think it great glory to be slapp(183,8)queen, and
made garter-knights of; but, be _your_ boast,(856,8)that ye were
(272,10)old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; _be_(70,11)him; account his kicks honors; and on no(36,9)kick back;
for you can’t help yourself(332,14)Don’t you see that(1959,8)?’
With that, he all of a sudden seemed(1807,10)in some queer fashion, to
swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my
hammock! Now, (1600,17) of that dream, Flask?”

“I don’t know; it seems(1412,10) foolish(1754,8)tho.’”

“May be; may be. But it’s(465,19) me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab
standing there, sideways look(1457,9)the stern? Well, the best thing
you can do(1986,9)is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,
whatever he says. Halloa! W(1389,8)at he shouts? Hark!”

“Mast-head, there! Look sharp,(535,8)ye! There are whales hereabouts!

“If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!

“W(488,25)now(486,8) ain’t there a small drop of
something queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man?
Look ye—there’s (85,10)special in the wind. Stand by(1803,9)Flask.
Ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this way.”


CHAPTER 32. Cetology.

Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost
in its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere
the Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of
the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter
almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative under(952,9)of the
more(493,9)(144,9)ic revelations and allusions of all sorts which
are to follow.

It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,
that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The
classifica(115,12)constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
essayed(1970,8) to what(1226,10)and latest authorities have laid down.

“No branch of Zoology is so much involved (841,8)which is entitled
(788,8),” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.

“It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter(1741,10)inquiry
as to the true method of divi(1541,8) cetacea into groups and families.
* * * Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal”
(sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale(257,9)39.

“Unfitness to pursue our research(1247,8)unfathomable waters.”
“Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge(602,9)etacea.” “A field
strewn(1034,8)orns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to
torture us naturalists.”

Thus speak(848,13), the great Cuvier, and John Hunt(17,8)Lesson,
those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real
(268,10)there be little, yet of books(1741,8)re a plenty; and so in
some(1768,8)egree, with c(760,8) or the science of whales. Many are
the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at
large or in(204,9)writte(1214,14). Run over a few:—The Authors
of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner;
Ray; Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;
Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick
(18,8)(588,11); Owen;(1158,9); Beale; Bennett; J. Ros(214,9)
t(289,9) of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to
what ultimate generalizing purpose a(874,9)have(448,8), the above
cited extracts will show.

Of the names in this list(632,9) authors, only those following Owen
ever saw living whales; and but on(1089,8)m was a real professional
harpooneer and whaleman. I mean(1545,17). On the separate
subject(1912,8)Greenland or right-whale, he is(1759,10)existing
(1757,8)y. But(1651,9) knew(1851,9)and says(1868,9)of(1164,10)
(1470,11), compared with which(154,15)whale is almost unworthy
mentioning. And (1138,8)it said, t(1954,8)(77,20)n usurper
upon the thr(390,10) seas. He(1853,8)even by any means the largest of
(1401,9)s. Yet, owing(1845,8)long priority of his claims,(739,8)
profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the
then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm(489,8)and which(116,11)to
this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats
(678,9)-ports; this usurpation has been every way (1802,8). Reference
to nearly(970,8) leviathanic allusions(1993,8)great poets of past
days, will satisfy you(548,25), without one rival, was
to them the monarch(562,14)But the time has at last come for a
new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the
(805,19)deposed,—(2044,10)(880,11) now reigneth!

T(1928,9)only two books in being which at all pretend to put the
living(100,13)before you, and at the same time,(423,8)remotest
degree succeed(454,8)attempt. Those books are Beale’s and(1629,8)’s;
both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both
exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the(360,13)to
be foun(207,8)ir volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,
it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to(909,11)
description. As yet, however,(185,16),(967,12)or poetic,
lives not(927,9) in any literature. Far above all other hunted
whales, his(1407,8)nwritten life.

Now the various species(1894,9)s need some sort of popular
comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the
present, hereafter to be filled(1267,8)its departments by subsequent
laborers. As no better man advances to take this(584,8)in hand, I
hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise(1908,9)(1335,8);
because any human thing supposed to be(1384,9), must for that very
reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not(1043,12)a minute anatomical(637,12)(1880,8)(479,15), or—in this place at least—to much
of any (714,13)My object here is simply to project the draught of
a systematiza(147,8)cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.

But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the
Post-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom(1635,11)
after them; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations,
ribs, and very pelvis(1735,8)world; t(939,8) fearful thing. What am I
that I should essay to hook the nose of this(1970,10)! The awful
tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he ((2042,13)) make a
covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam
through libraries and sailed (29,8)oceans;(57,8)had to do with
whales(133,9)se visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There
are some preliminaries to settle.

First: The uncertain, unsettled condi(885,10)is science of Cetology
is(1930,8)very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it
still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of
Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the(1569,8)from
the fish.” But of(1349,8)knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,
sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against(171,8)’s express edict,
were still found dividing the possess(1312,11)same sea(586,10)
L(827,8).

The grounds upon which(298,9)would fain have banished(294,21)waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular
heart, their lungs(13,8)movable eyelid(23,9)hollow ears, penem
intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure
meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley
Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and
they united(869,8)opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
insufficient.(162,8) profanely hinted they were humbug.

Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
ground(178,10)whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.
This fundamental thing settled, the nex(1076,8)is, in what internal
respect does(139,11)differ from other fish. Above(1088,10)has given
you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;
whereas, all(119,11) are lungless and cold blooded.

Next: how shall we defin(1220,11), by his obvious externals, so as
conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a
(458,9)_a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.
However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
meditation. A walrus spouts much like(1596,8), but the(41,8)is not a
fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term(1387,8)(165,13)
still more cogent, as coupled(2007,9) first. Almost any one must have
noticed that all (1680,8) familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a
vertical, or up-and-down tail. W(642,9)mong(450,15)the tail,
though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes(509,13)
position.

By the abov(316,13)of what(2021,9)is, I do by no means exclude
from the l(1749,8)ic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
(398,9)whale by the best informed(1470,10)ers; nor, on the other
hand, link with it any fish(116,10)authoritatively regarded as
alien.* Hence,(492,9)smaller,(856,9), and(849,16)ed fish
must be includ(1582,8)is ground-plan of Cetology. Now(968,8)come the
grand divisions(737,8)entir(1463,8)host.

*I am aware that down to the present time,(698,10)styled Lamatins and
Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish(867,8)Coffins(1870,13)) are
(241,9)by many naturalists among(1651,10)s. But as these pig-fish
are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking(1929,8)mouths of rivers,
and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny
their credentials as whales; and hav(353,9)ed them(1110,9)ir
passports to quit the Kingdom(514,13)

First: According to magnitude I divid(1622,11)s into three primary
BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them
all, both small and large.

I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAV(22,11)I. the DUODECIMO WHALE.

Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitan(135,8) globe;
the most formidable of all(901,8)to encounter; (48,9)majestic in
aspect; and lastly, by far(48,10)valuable in commerce; he being the
only(1858,10)from which tha(65,11)substance, spermaceti, is
obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged
upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically
considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was
almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil
was only accidentally (309,8) from the stranded fish; in those days
(371,13)t would seem, was popularly supposed to be deriv(102,8)a
(487,9)identical(1623,9) one then (233,9)England(932,8)Greenland
or (1180,11). It was the idea also, that this same(566,11) was
that quickening humor(909,9)(107,8) Whale(657,9)e first syllable
of the word literally expresses. I(327,8)times, also(706,12) was
exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment
and medicament(278,9)only to be ha(496,11)druggists as you
nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of
time, the true nature of(383,12)became known, its original name was
still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a
notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation
must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whal(1223,15)i(832,12) was really(798,8)(1769,31)I. ((1932,13)).—In one respect this is(1496,10)vener(1495,8)the leviathans,(1404,10) on(722,8)regularly

Some pretend to see a difference between(1836,15)w(502,11)(550,9)(1027,8)right(35,13)(294,9)s. But they precisely agree
in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
determinate fact upon(2007,8)o ground a radical distinction(604,8)by
endless subdivisions bas(1536,12)most inconclusive(312,11)s, that
some departments of(846,8) history become so repellingly intricate.
T(341,15)will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with
re(464,8)to elucidat(1563,8)sperm whale(1696,32)I. (_Fin-Back_).—Under this head I reckon
a monster which,(2008,8)(709,8)names of (78,8), Tall-Spout, and
Long-John,(957,9) seen almost in every sea and is(1710,10)(940,12)ose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
Atlantic,(1052,8)New York packet-tracks. In th(379,8) he attains, and
in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles(834,16), but is of a less
portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great
lips(830,8) a cable-like aspect, form(1319,10)intertwisting, slanting
folds of large wrinkles(107,8)and distinguishing(980,8), the fin,
from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin
is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder
part(1939,8)back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed
end. Even if not the slightest(1472,11)(2045,8)creature be visible,
this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting(216,9)
surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with
spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows
(1337,9)wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery
circle surrounding it somewhat(838,11)a dial, with its style and
wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes
back. The(1217,9) is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some
men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly
rising to the(337,8)(1192,8)remotest and most sullen waters; his
straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear
upon a barr(656,8); gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in
swimming, as to defy all(1192,9)pursuit from man; this leviathan seems
the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark
that style upo(1467,8)ck. From hav(1856,8)baleen in his mouth, the
(538,12)sometimes includ(281,8)(1519,17)among a theoretic
species denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of
these so called (67,16), there would seem to be several
varieties, most of(2013,8)however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales
and beak(18,9); pike-head(20,11)bunch(36,11)under-jawed
whales and rostrat(95,9), are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.

In connection(403,8)is appellative of “(301,17)” it is of
great importance to mention, that(288,8) such a nomenclature may be
convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of(441,9)yet it is
in vain to attempt a clear classification(1766,8)L(830,8), founded
upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that
those(1611,8)parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to
afford the basi(452,8)regular system of Cetology than any other
detached bodily distinctions, which the(896,8)in his kinds,(1147,8)s.
How then? T(1012,9), hump, back-fin, and(275,8)these are things whose
peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed(1037,8)ll sorts(499,11)
without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in
other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the
humpbac(972,9), each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.
Then, this same (84,16)(109,8) Greenlan(108,14)of these
ha(684,8)(117,12)again(123,23) And it is just the
same(1436,10)other parts above(986,8)ed. In various(416,18)they form such ir(690,8)combinations; or,(1966,8)case of any one of
them (705,8), such an(77,11)isolation; as utterly(1853,12)
general methodization formed upon(1173,8)basis. On this rock every one
of(805,10)-naturalists has split.

But it may possibly be conceived that(240,9)internal(1051,8)f the
(903,14)anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
right(1263,15). Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the
(619,15)’(139,9) more striking than(1317,11)? Yet we have
seen that by(1354,11) it is impossible correctly to(1448,8)y(136,20). And if you descend into the bowel(330,8)(667,8)
l(1506,8)s, why there you will not find(1305,13) a fiftieth part as
avail(364,8)the systematizer as those external ones already
enumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold(1702,8)whales
bodily(818,8)ir entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.
And this is the Bibliographical(1621,8)here adopted; a(1067,9)the only
one that can(754,10)succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.

BOOK I. (_Folio_) CHAPTER IV. (_Hump Back_).—This whale is often seen
on the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,
and towed into harbor(62,9)a great pack on him like a peddler; or
you might call him the Elephant and Castle(729,9)t any rate, the
popular name for him does not sufficient(2004,9)guish him, since the

valuable(325,10)aleen. He(581,8)most gamesome and light-hearted of
all(718,11), making more gay foam and white water generally than any
other of them(575,20),(576,9)V. (_Razor(576,9)Of t(579,10)little is
known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a
retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no
coward, he has never yet shown any part of him(179,9)back, which
rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know(263,8)more of him, nor
does anybody else(367,31)I. (_Sulphur Bottom_).—Another (286,8)
gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings(690,8)seldom seen;
(1879,8)(495,8)never(501,10)except(1975,8)remoter southern seas, and
then always at too gre(564,14)to study his countenance. He is
never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are
told of him. Adieu, (407,14)! I can say(1663,9)more that is true
of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.

Thus ends (909,19)and now begin(34,8)I. (_Octavo_).

OCTAVOES.*—These embrace(1792,11) of middling magnitude, among which
present may be numbered:—I., the _Grampus_; I(20,9)Black Fish_;
I(24,10)Narwhale_; IV(65,8)Thrasher_; (20,9)Killer_.

*Why this book of(189,8)is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
Because, whil(260,16)this order,(1476,8)(1474,8)than those of
the former(47,8)nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them
in figure, yet the bookbinder’s(195,8)volume in its dimensioned form
(1723,9)preserve the shape of the Foli(72,8), but the Octav(95,8)
does(1524,9)(581,13)(1526,10)I. ((488,9)).—Though this fish, whose
loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to
landsmen, is so well known a denizen(227,8)deep, yet is he not(2026,8)ly classed(722,9)ales. But possessing (1863,8)grand
distinctive featur(549,8)e leviathan, most naturalists have recognised
him for on(1164,8) of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to
twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding(549,10)s round the
waist. He swims in herds; he i(1808,8)regularly hunted(779,9)his oil
is considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some
fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory(710,8)advanc(725,8)

Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and
suggest another. I do so now, touching the (1390,10), so-called,
because blackness is the rule among almost all(798,9)So, call him the
Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is(939,11), and from the
circum(1973,8)hat the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale
averages some sixteen or eighteen(875,15)(958,8)found in almost
all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin
in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
profitably employed, the(805,12) hunters sometimes capture(484,11)whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic
employment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and
quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.
(1694,9)eir blubber is very thin, som(1829,8)se whales will yield you
upwards of thirty gallons of oil(1143,34)I. (_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril

speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out(1144,9) jaw
in a line a little depresse(1186,10) horizontal. But it is only found
on the sinister side(948,8)has an ill effect, giving its owner
(978,10)analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What
precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to
say. It does not seem to be used like the blad(1914,8) sword-fish and
bill-fish;(491,13)sailors tell m(1517,11)(778,8) employs it for
a rake in turning over the bottom(128,9)ea for food. Charley Coffin
said it was used for an ice-piercer; for(139,13), rising to the
surfac(241,9)Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his
horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either(1174,9)
surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided
horn may really(483,9)by(405,13)—(63,10)at may be—(572,8)
certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.
T(518,12)I have heard called the Tusk(1260,10)the Horn(1278,9)

against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.
It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same
way(1008,10)horns(1084,8)male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.
O(1711,10)it(278,8)itself accounted an object of great curiosity.
Black Letter tells(1163,9)Sir Martin Frobisher on his return(1598,8)at
voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him
from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the
Thames; “when(195,12)return(1736,10)at voyage,” saith Black
Letter, “on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long
horn(1552,8)(1350,10)which for a long period after hung in the castle
at Windsor.” An Irish author avers(1592,10)Earl of Leicester, on

and he is seldom hunted(1356,8)mostly(1311,10)the circumpolar seas.

BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER IV. (_Killer_).—Of this whale(143,8)is

naturalist. From what(1643,8)seen of him at a distance, I should say
that he was about the bigness of a grampus(1655,8)very savage—a sort of
Feegee fish. He sometimes take(1489,12)Folio whales(1946,8)lip, and
hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.

To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
feet(1204,8)be marshalled among WHALES—a word, which,(1925,8)popular
sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down
above as (433,9)es are infallibly whales,(1244,8)terms of my
definition of what a whale is—_i.e._ a spouting fish, with a horizontal
tail(1679,10)(578,16)(1683,10)1. (_(536,14)(1023,9)is the
common porpoise found almost all over the globe. T(1279,8)is of my own
bestowal; for there are more than one(1387,9)(110,8)s, and something
must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always

themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their
appearance is generally hailed with delight(1794,8)mariner. Full of
fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.
They are the lads that(776,8)live before the wind. (52,9)accounted
a lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding
these vivacious fish, then(358,8)help ye; th(255,8) of godly

you one good gallon of good oil(1025,10)fine and delicate fluid

gentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other(1972,10)
have),(370,8)a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel
hue. But his m(586,10) spoils all. Though his entire back down to his
side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as(1915,8)k
in a ship’s hull, called the “bright waist,” that line streaks him from
stem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.
The white comprises part of his head, and the whole(27,8)mouth, which
makes him look as if he had just escap(1737,8)a felonious visit to a
meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like(884,8)
the common(586,9).

Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the

Leviathans of not(1734,10)re are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,
half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by
reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their
fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
future investigators, who may complete what(1656,8)here but begun. If
any(1395,9)ollowing(275,9)shall hereafter be caught and marked, then
he can readily be incorporated into this System, according(1067,8)Folio, Octavo, or (1758,9) magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk

(787,12)(762,9)blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I
omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them
for mere sounds, full of (994,9)ism, but signifying nothing.

Finally: It was stated at the outset, that(1186,13)would not be

CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.

Concerning the officers(1737,13)-craft(1828,8)eems as good a place
as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising
from the existence(1875,8)harpooneer class of(174,9), a class unknown
of course in any other marine than(223,11)fleet.

The large importance attached to(136,15)’s vocation is evinced
by the fac(954,8)originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries
and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the
person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
officer(63,12)(577,12) Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;
usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief H(497,9). In
those days,(197,12)’s(1598,9)y was restrict(434,10)navigation
and general management(1107,8)vessel; while over(772,11)hunting
department and all its concerns,(291,16) or(209,17)
reigned supreme. In the British Greenland(544,10)under the corrupted
title of Specksioneer, this(611,11)official is still retained, but
his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as
senior(436,11); and as such,(1251,8)on(976,9)(448,10)more
inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as(1545,10)good conduc(447,8)
(1058,10)s the success(818,10)ing voyage largely depends, and since
in the American(930,8) he is not only an(1062,9)t(1335,8)(887,8)boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on(167,10)
ground)(1018,16)the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand
political maxim(68,9)ea demands, that he should nominally live apart(1432,10)men b(102,10)mast, and be in some way distinguished as their
professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as
their social equal.

Now,(250,10) distinction drawn(1246,9)(1235,8)and man at sea, is
this—the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and
merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with(1434,12); and
so, too, in mos(1191,9)(666,9)whal(749,8)(765,12)are(1544,10)
the after par(1260,9)ship. That is to say, they tak(162,8)meals(69,8)(1394,10)cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with
it.

Though the long period of a Southern(945,16)(by far(53,9)est
of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and
(1887,8)unity of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high
or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but(1242,9)ir
common luck, together(548,9)ir common vigilance, intrepidity, and
hard work(860,11)l these things do(945,9)cases tend to beget a
less rigorous discipline than in (744,12)generally; yet, never mind
how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may,(1108,8)
primitive instances, live(290,9); for all that, the punctilious
externals, at least,(2042,8)quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,
and in no(138,9) done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in
which you will see the skipper parading his(158,14)with an elated
grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as
much outward homage as if he w(1619,8)imperial purple, and not the
shabbiest of pilot-cloth.

And(1506,8)of all men the moody(1270,8)(1761,8)Pequod was the least
given to that sort of shallowest assumption; a(113,10)the only homage
he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience(1698,9)he
required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping(1001,9)
(628,12)(179,16)re were times when, owing to(1226,9)
circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he
addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in
terrorem_, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means
unobservan(1757,9)paramount forms and usages(1722,9)ea.

Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind
those(103,17), as it were, he sometimes masked himself;
incidentally making use of them f(276,8) and more private ends than
they were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of
his brain, which had(401,10) in a good degree remained unmanifested;
through (284,12)that same(114,11)became incarnate in an
irresistible dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what
it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over
other men, without the aid of some(1096,9)(1564,8) arts and
entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.
This it is, that for ever keeps God’s true princ(740,10)Empire from
the world’s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can
give, to those men who become famous more (515,10)eir infinite
inf(420,9)to the choice hidden handful(1875,8)Divine Inert,(747,8)(90,12)undoubted(511,13)over the dead leve(82,9)mass.
Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political
superstitions invest them, that in some royal(2024,9)s even to idiot
imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, a(167,8) case of
Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an
(1947,9)brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the
tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would
depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,
ever forget a hint, (1386,13)so important in his art, as the one
now alluded to.

But Ahab, my(1685,8), still moves(268,8)me in all his Nantucket
grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and
Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old
whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings
and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be gr(233,9)ee, it
must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for(770,8)deep, and
feature(93,8) unbodied air!


CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.

It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale
loaf-of-bread face(187,10)cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord
and master; who, sitting(1005,8)lee quarter-boat, has just been taking
an observation(1547,8)sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on
the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reser(402,8)that daily purpos(72,9)upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the
tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But
presently, catching hold(1564,9)izen shrouds, he swings himself(143,8)deck,(947,8)an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr.
Starbuck,” disappears in(1810,8)abin.

When the last echo(320,8)sultan’s step has died away, and (98,9)
the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then(176,9) rouses f(436,8)quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,
and, after a grave peep(249,10)binnacle, says, with some touch of
pleasantness(342,14) Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second
Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the
main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that(1659,10)
rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and(1485,8)rapid(597,9)
Mr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors.

But the third Emir, now seeing(748,9)all alone on th(1149,10)deck,
seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
sorts of knowing winks(1851,8)(30,9)directions, and kicking off his
shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
over the Grand Turk’s head;(522,9), by a dexterous sleight, pitching
his cap u(731,11)mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so
far at least as he remains visibl(1639,11)deck, reversing all other
processions, by bringing(607,8)rear with music. But ere stepping into
(1740,9) doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,
then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence,
in the character of Abjectus, or the Slav(2009,12)t the(334,8)m(1178,8)strange things bred by the intense
artificialness of sea-usages, that while(1959,8)open air(1914,8)deck
some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
very(134,10)the next moment go dow(1907,8)ir customary dinner in that
same(115,10)’s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say
deprecatory and humble air(221,9)him, as he sits at the hea(1971,8)
table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this
difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of
Babylon; and t(46,24)not haughtily but courteously,
therein certainly must(122,11)(1803,13) mundane grandeur. But he
who(654,8)rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
private dinner-table of invited guest(771,8)man’s unchallenged power
and dominion of individual influence for the time;(81,12)royalty
of state transcends(391,11)’s, for(409,11) wa(1013,10)greatest.
Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Cæsar.
It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.
Now, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a
ship-master,(1695,10)inference, you will derive the cause of that
peculiarity(1246,8)life just mentioned.

O(542,8)ivory-inlaid table, Ahab(585,8)d like a mute, maned sea-lion
on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still
deferential cubs. In(691,8) proper turn, each(1396,8) waited to be
served. They were a(1664,9)children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,
there seemed(1238,8)lurk the smallest(534,8)arrogance. With one mind,
(1315,8)tent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife(1302,8)carved
the chief dish(187,8)him. I do not suppose that(881,9)world they
would have profaned tha(1567,9)with the slightest observation, even
upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his
knife and fork, between(852,10) slice of beef was locked, Ahab
thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate(1634,14)the mate received his
meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little
started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed
it noiseless(99,8)swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like
the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor
profoundly dines(527,11)even Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals
were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence(892,9) at table old
Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief
it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket(1887,8)hold
below. And poor(1098,8)Flask, he was the youngest son, and(1141,8)boy
of this weary family party. His w(410,8)shinbones of the saline beef;
his (971,11)been the drumsticks. For Flask to(1010,8)esumed to help
himself, this must hav(1265,9)to him tantamount to larceny in the
first degree. Had he helped(408,9)at th(473,8), doubtless, never
more(207,8)e(210,11)able to hold his head up in this honest world;
nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never(594,9)him. And had Flask
(186,14), the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.
Least of all, did Flask(386,8)(385,8)(698,9)to butter. Whether he
thought the owner(525,10)hip denied it to him, on account of its
clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or w(119,9) deemed that, on so
long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and
therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was,(868,8)alas!
was a butterless man!

Another thing. Flask(915,9)last person down at the dinner, an(512,8)is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly
jammed in point of time.(1695,9) and Stubb both had the start of him;
(1297,8)they also have the privilege of lounging(1197,8)rear. If Stubb
even, who is but a peg higher than(1219,9)appens(1070,9)but a small
appetite, and soon shows symptoms of conclud(622,8)repast, then Flask
must bestir(867,10)he will not get more than three mouthfuls that
day; for it is(1879,9)holy usage for Stubb to precede(1290,10)the
deck. T(655,9)(1569,8)hat Flask once admitted in private, that ever
since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he
(1100,10)known what(145,9)o be otherwise than hungry, more or less.
For what he ate did not(1185,9)relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal
in him. Peace and satisfaction, (1172,8)(565,9)ve for ever departed
from my stomach. I am(267,11); but, how I wish I could fish a bit of
old-fashioned beef(1940,8)forecastle, as I used to when I was before
the mast. There’s the fruits of promotion now; t(37,11)vanity of
glory:(29,13)ins(31,8) life! Besides, if it were so that any
mere sailor(2007,8)Pequod had a grudge(724,9)Flask in(1132,8)
official capacity, all that(87,8)had to do, in order to obtain ample
vengeance,(614,8)go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep (798,8)
through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered(405,8)awful Ahab.

Now, Ahab and his(1019,8)ates formed what may be called(1451,11)table
in(340,11)’s cabin. After thei(675,8)ure, taking place in inverted
(310,9)their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was
restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the
three harpooneers were bidd(1130,10)fe(1381,8)y being its residuary
legatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’ hall(670,8)high and
mighty cabin.

In strange contrast(1275,8)hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
invisible domineerings(792,8)captain’s tabl(682,8)he entire care-free
license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior
fellows(190,8)(366,8). While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid
of the sound(320,10)nge(212,8)ir own jaws,(109,16) chewed
their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined
like lords; they fi(818,8)ir bellies like Indian ships all day loading
with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that
to fill out the vacancies made(782,9)revious repast, often(809,8)e
Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly
quarried out(1413,8)solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he
(1889,8)go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then(275,9) had an
ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,
harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized(161,8)sudden humor, assisted(343,10)’s memory by snatch(135,8)up bodily, and thrusting his head
into(387,9)empty wooden trencher, while(540,11)knife in hand,
began laying(555,9)circle preliminary to scalping him. He was
naturally a very nervous, shuddering(1275,9)little fellow, this
bread-face(1428,9); the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital
nur(395,8)what with the standing spectacle(1382,8)black terrific Ahab,
and the periodical tumultuous visitation(1330,8)se three savages,(472,13)whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after
seeing(1199,17)furnish(604,9)ll things they demanded, he
would escape from their clutches into his(404,8)pantry adjoining, and
fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was
over.

It was a sight to see(1221,10)seated over against(1237,11)opposing
his filed teeth(1942,8)Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo(98,9)n
the floor, for a bench would have brought(878,8)rse-plumed head to the
low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, mak(481,8)low
cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in
a ship. But for(546,8)s, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,
not to say dainty. It(1912,8)hardly possible that by such comparatively
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused(600,9)so
broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this nobl(919,8)
fed strong and drank deep(1676,8)abounding element of air;(1401,8)ough
his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime lif(1131,9)worlds. Not by
beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But(2024,9), he had a
mortal, barbaric smack(1886,8)lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so
much so, that the trembling (2041,10)almost looked(949,8)whether any
marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms(1444,8)en he(877,8)ear
(1961,9)sing(1675,8)for him to produce himself, th(1940,8)ones might
be picked, the simple-witt(1629,10) all but shattered the crockery
hanging round him(475,8)pantry, by his(2009,8)fit(1550,8) palsy. Nor
did the whetstone which(1492,17)carri(575,9)ir pockets, for
their lances and other weapons; and with which(109,10)s, at dinner,
they would ostentatiously sharpe(123,8)knives; that grating sound did
not at all tend to tranquillize poor(566,10). How could he forget
that(537,8)Island days,(737,11)for one, must certainly have been
guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas!(723,10)!
hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin
sh(221,8)carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his
great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to
his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling
in them(1735,10)step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.

But(220,8) these(1179,8)ans din(1317,10)cabin, and nominally lived
there; still, being anything but sedentary(819,10)habits, they were
scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
when they pas(1693,12)it to their own peculiar quarters.

In this one matter, Ahab(1867,8)no exception to most American whale
captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion(1942,9)rights
the ship’s cabin belongs to them(1767,8)at it is by courtesy alone that
anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,
the mates and(1294,13)of the Pequod might more properly be said to
have lived out(1995,8)cabin than in it. For (457,10)did enter it, it
was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a
moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,
residing(1647,8)open air. Nor did they lose much hereby;(853,13)
was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though(910,10)
includ(947,11)ensus of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He
liv(1015,10)world, as the las(437,9)Grisly Bears (52,9)settled
Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer ha(1299,8)ed, that wild Logan
of the woods, burying himself(2020,8)hollow of a tree,(609,11)the
winter there, sucking his own paws; so,(1763,8)inclement, howling old
age, Ahab’s soul, shut up(1313,10)ved trunk of his body, there fed
upon the sullen paws of its gloom!


CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.

It was during the more pleasant weather, (1972,8)due rotation with the
other seamen my first mast-head came round.

In(1254,20)men the(53,10)s are manned almost
simultaneously(128,9) vessel’s leaving her port; even(1681,8)she may
have fifteen thousand mil(1550,8)more, to sail ere reach(90,9)roper
cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she
is drawing nigh home with(1781,10)empty in her—say, an empty vial
even—then, her(325,16)kept(330,8)to(889,9); and not till her
skysail-poles sail in among the spire(1443,9)port, does she altogether
relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.

Now(1046,9)business of standing(537,11), ashore or afloat, is a
very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate
here. I take it, that the earliest standers of(686,12)were the old
Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior(1936,8).
For(698,8)their progenitors, the buil(139,8)Babel, must doubtless, by
their tower, have intended to rear the loftie(952,13)in all Asia,
or Africa either; yet ((247,8)final truck was put to it) as that great
stone m(1530,10)irs ma(2007,12) have gone by the board, in the
dread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel
(313,9)priority over the (443,9). And(512,10)(467,9) were a
nation(518,13)(540,9), is an assertion based (1457,9)general
belief among archæologists(635,11)first pyrami(618,8)founded for
astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported(345,8)peculiar
stair-like form(221,9)all four sid(1019,8)ose edifices; whereby, with
prodigious long uplifting(1079,8)ir legs, those old (193,8)ers were
wont to mount(1204,8)apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the
look-outs of a modern ship(63,14)a sail, or a whale just bearing
in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,
who built him a lofty stone pillar(2040,8)desert and spent the whole
latter por(635,8)his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the
ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a
dauntless(1290,8)-of-(1975,10); who was not to be driven from his
place by fogs or frosts, rain, h(401,8)sleet; but valiantly facing
everyth(522,8)(1752,11), literally died at his post. Of modern
(1481,8)(192,14)(259,9)but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,
and bronze men; who,(1462,8)well capable of fac(697,8)a stiff gale,
are still entirely incompete(768,10)(1815,13)ing(773,8)upon
discovering any strange(700,8)There is Napoleo(170,8)(1169,9)top of
the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and
fifty feet(724,8)air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;
whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, o(32,8)the Devil. Great
Washington, too(191,9)high aloft on his towering main-mast in
Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars, his(307,8)marks that
point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral
Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal(222,11)s(1979,13)
Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscur(1552,8)at London smoke,
token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
smoke, must be fire. But neither great (437,12)nor(681,9), nor(269,9)will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to
befrien(1790,8)ir counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;
(95,8)it may be surmised(1973,10)ir spirits penetrate through the
thick haze of the futu(628,8)descry what shoals and what rocks(336,8)
shunned.

It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the(564,10)(1297,9)(145,8)la(1576,8)thos(168,9)sea; but that in truth it is not
so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole
historian of Nantucket(1158,9)accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,
(158,9)he early time(221,9)whale fishery, ere ships were regularly
launched in pursuit(433,8)game, the people of that island erected
lofty spars along(327,8)-coast, to(613,10) look-outs ascended by
means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.
A few years ago this same plan was adopt(1041,8)e Bay whalemen of New
Zealand,(1604,11)descrying(282,11)gave notice(1952,8)ready-manned
boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we
then(2048,8)one proper(1292,10), that of a whale-ship at sea. The
thre(778,11)s are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set;(786,8)men
taking their(578,8) turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other
every two hours. In the serene weather(1077,8)tropics it is exceedingly
pleasan(997,15); nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is
delightful. There you stand, a(2031,9)feet above the silent decks,
striding(757,11)deep, as if(1149,9)s were gigantic stilts, while
beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters
(1213,10), even as ships once saile(94,10)the boot(1292,9)famous
Colossus at old Rhodes(291,19)los(1150,9)infinite series of
(139,9)with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship
indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you
into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime
uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
with startling(1511,8)s of commonplaces never delude you into
unnecessary excitements(130,11)of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt
securities; fall of stocks; are never trouble(1822,9)e thought of what
you shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three(1434,8)nd more
are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.

In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’
voyage, as often happens, the sum(1874,8)various hours you spend at the
(1424,9) would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be
deplored that the place(1859,10)you devote so considerable a portion(1037,8)whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of
anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a
comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,
a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any o(1610,10)ose small
and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your
most usual point of perch is the head(1735,9)’ gallant-mast, w(1652,8)
stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)
called(104,15) cross-trees. Here, tossed about by(1585,10)the
beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns. To
be sure, in cold(2002,9)you may carry your house aloft with you, in
the shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest
(47,10) is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul
is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about
in it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing
(like an ignorant pilgrim cross(262,8)snowy Alps in winter); so a(281,17)t so much(285,12)as it is a mere envelope, or
additional skin encasing you. You(264,8)put a shelf or chest of
drawers in your body, and(424,9)can you make a convenient closet of
your(534,11).

Concerning all this,(1375,17) (1375,18)(1463,9)s of a
(1602,14) ship are unprovid(1813,10)ose enviable little tents or
pulpits, called _crow’s-nests_,(1136,10)the look-outs of a Greenland
whaler are protected from the inclement(867,9)of the frozen seas. In
the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the
Icebergs, in quest(1818,8)(177,9) Wha(784,8)incidentally for the
re-discovery(1880,8)Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old(270,10);” in this
admirable volume, all standers of(471,12)are furnish(445,8)a
charmingly circumstantial accoun(220,9)then recently invented
(464,12)_(264,9)lacier, which was the nam(365,18)’s
good craft. He(554,8)it the _Sleet’s (105,12), in honor of
himself; he be(1286,8)original inventor and patentee, and free from all
ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children
after(23,9)names (we fathers(164,28)s and
(165,8)s), so likewise should we denominate (110,9)selves(2033,10)
apparatus we may beget. In shape, the(390,8)(352,12) is something
like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however(2011,8)it is
(632,16) movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head
in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summi(913,9)mast, you ascend into
it through a(1201,9)rap-hatch in the bottom. On th(359,8)side, or
side next the stern(1142,8)ship, is a comfortable seat,(255,8)locker
underneath for umbrellas,(58,8)ers, and coats. In front is a leather
rack(1355,12)o keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and
other nautical(1645,10)ces. When(1315,14) in person stood his
(1603,9)(1184,8)(596,13)of his, he tells us that he always had a
rifle with him (also fixed(411,8)rack), together(596,8)powder flask
and shot,(1396,8) purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or
vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for y(2037,9)
successfully shoot at them(1718,10)deck owing to the resistance of the
water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it
was plainly a labor of love for(474,15)to describe, as he does,
all th(2019,9)detailed(556,13) of (505,15); but though he
so enlarges upon man(1796,8)se, and(46,10) treats us to a very
scientific(1701,12)his experiments(644,20)(895,9)small
compass he kept there(559,20)counteract(1629,8)errors
resulting from what is(1730,8)the “local attraction” of all binnacle
magnets; an error ascribable(539,8)horizontal vicinit(307,8) iron in
(1147,8)’s planks, an(819,9)Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having
been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, tha(490,8)
the(2025,9)is(674,8)screet and (454,11)here, yet, for all his
learned “(299,8) deviations,” “azimuth (456,8)observ(32,9)and
“approximat(437,8),” he knows very well,(1247,14),(1178,9)was
not so much immers(1163,8)ose profound magnetic meditations, as to fail
being(523,8)ed occasionally towards that well replenished little
case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side(907,14) (768,10)in
easy reach(945,8)hand. Though,(1119,9) whole, I greatly admire and
even love the brave, the honest, and (452,8)Captain; yet I take it
very ill of him(1553,9)should so utterly ignore that (263,12)
seeing what a faithful friend and(1868,10) it must have been, while
with mittened fingers and hooded head he was study(1034,8)mathematics
alof(1095,8)in that bird’s nest within three or four perches(1523,8)pole.

But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
(1969,14)and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is
(501,8)counter-balanced by the widely contrasting sere(1182,10)ose
seductive seas in which(219,9) (210,8)mostly float. For one, I used
to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting(1273,8)top to have a
chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;
then ascending a(1811,8)way further(1736,8)rowing a lazy leg over the
top-sail yard, take a preliminary view(1511,8)watery pastures, and so
at last mount to my ultimate destination.

Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept
but sorry guard. With the problem(1688,8)universe revolving in me, how
could I—being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering
altitude—how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all
whale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out
every time.”

And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
Nantucket! Beware of enli(735,9)your vigilant fisheries any lad with
lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable(1725,9)veness; and who
offers to ship w(502,8)Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware
of such an(990,8)say; your whales must be seen before they can be
killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes
round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor
are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the(1481,13)y
furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded
young men, disgusted(420,10)carking cares of earth, and seeking
sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently(1732,8)
himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed (901,10),
and in moody phrase ejaculates:—


“Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand
blubber-hunters sweep(1430,9)e in vain.”



Very often do the captains (714,8)ships take those(410,14) young
philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
“interest”(1754,8)voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost
to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would
rather not see(952,8)than otherwise. But all(337,8); those young
(930,9)s have a notion(193,9)ir vision is imperfect;(220,9)
short-sighted; what use, then, to stra(300,8)isual nerve? They have
lef(110,8)opera-glasses at home.

“Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been
cruising now hard(806,8)ree years, and thou hast not raised a whale
yet. Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.”
Perhap(463,8)ere; or p(22,10)re might have been shoals of them in
the far horizon; but lulled into(1509,10)pium-like listlessness of
vacant, unconscious reverie is this(844,18)th by the blending
cadence of waves(1692,8)oughts, that at last he loses his identity;
takes the mystic ocean at his feet for(587,8)ible image of that deep,
blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,
half-seen, gliding, beautiful th(1002,9)eludes him; every
dimly-discovered, uprising fin(1415,9)undiscernible form, seems to him
the embodiment of those elusive(352,9) that only people the soul by
continually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit
ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused(93,9)time and space;
like Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming(565,9)a part of
every shore the round globe over.

There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea;(793,8)sea, from
the inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on
ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your
(873,8) comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And
perhaps, at mid-day,(1806,8)fairest weather, with one half-throttled
shriek you drop(561,10)hat transparent air into the summer sea, no
more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye(605,10)s!


CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.

(_Enter Ahab: Then, all._)

It was not a grea(444,8)after the affair of the pipe,(925,8)e morning
shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that
hour, as country gentlemen,(208,11)same meal, take a few turns(1667,8)garden.

Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that(1865,10) all over
dented, like geological stones,(1697,8)e peculiar mark of his walk. Did
you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,
you would see still(1641,8)r foot-prints—the(16,12)(143,8)one
unsleeping, ever-pacing(1893,8).

But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his
nervous step that(698,8) left a deeper mark. And, so full of his
thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the
main-mast and(25,11) binnacle, you could almost see(531,8)ought
turn in him as he turned, and pace(30,14)paced; so completely
possessing him, indee(637,8)it all but seemed the inward mould(1718,10)outer movement.

“D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s(213,8)pecks
the shell. ’Twill soon be out.”

The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, (618,9)e
deck(829,11)same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.

It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the
bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg(1586,10)auger-hole there, and
(1686,11)nd grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody
aft.

“Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
ship-board except in some extraordinary case.

“S(139,13) aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”

When the entire ship’s compan(1360,8)ssembl(816,8)with curious and not
wholly unapprehensive faces, were eye(828,9)for he(1152,8)not unlike
the weather horizon when a storm is coming up(1837,9)fter rapidly
glancing over the (560,14)then da(563,10)eyes among the crew,
started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him
resumed his heavy turns(1592,8)(1971,8)With bent head and half-slouched
hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering(1085,8)ing among
the men; till Stubb cautiously(1133,11)to Flask, that Ahab must have
summoned them there for the(1010,9)of witnessing a pedestrian feat.
But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—

“What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”

“Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
voices.

“Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval(1268,8)tones; observ(1343,8)hearty animation into which his unexpected(1975,9) had so magnetically
thrown them.

“And w(283,10)next(265,10)Lower away, and after him!”(59,12)tune is it ye pull to(335,10)A dead whale or a stove boat!”

More and more strangely and fiercely glad an(301,8)ing, grew the
countenance(723,8)old man at every shout; while the mariners began to
gaze(1187,8)ly at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
themselves became so excited at such seemingly(1774,8)less(439,9)s.

But, the(1356,8)ll eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
pivot-hole, (1724,14)reaching high up(1732,11)and tightly,
almost convulsively(1784,10)it, address(987,10)us:—

“All ye m(1610,8)ers have before now heard me give orders about a white
whale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a
broad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye
see it? Mr.(2011,9), hand me yon top-maul.”

W(615,11)te was getting the hammer(1674,8)without speaking, was
slowly rubb(55,8)gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if
to heighten its lustre(1939,10)out using any words was meanwhile lowly
humming to himself, producing a sound so(960,11)muffled and
inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical (106,8)(1692,8)heel(221,8)
vitality in him.

Recei(1318,8)(388,9) from(424,12)e advanced towards the main-mast
with(412,11) uplifted in(822,9), exhibi(456,9)gold (58,8)
(1065,8)nd(1503,8)high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises
me(767,8)-heade(1340,8)(1588,8)rinkled brow and a crooked jaw;
w(87,21) me that(90,19),(196,8)ree holes
punctured(1685,8)starboard fluke—look ye, (110,25)
that same white(1895,8)he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”

“Huzza! huzza(1857,9)the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
hailed the act of nail(849,13)to the mast.

“It’s(1151,8)(287,8)I say,” resum(1988,9)as he threw down the
topmaul: “(68,13). Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for
white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”

All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of
the(678,19)(676,11) they had started as if each was
separately touched by some specific recollection.

“Captain Ahab,” said(265,11)“(764,10) whale must be the same that
some call Moby Dick.”

“(14,9)?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know th(749,13) then, Tash?”

“Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir,(1828,8)he goes down?” said the
Gay-Header deliberately.

“And has he a(85,8) spout, too(280,8)(535,8)“very bushy, even for a
parmacetty, and mighty quick, (362,12)?”(118,8)e have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
Captain,(996,8)(683,9)disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like
him—him—” faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and
round as though uncorking a bottle—“like (110,9)

“Corkscrew(1190,9)Ahab, “aye,(889,9), the harpoons lie (209,8)ted
and wrench(1399,8)m; aye(966,10)his spout is a big one, like a whole
shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the
great annual sheep-shearing; aye,(1123,11)and(724,12)s like a
split jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is(884,10) ye have
seen—(907,9)(10,10)!”(1011,23)(2037,10)who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
been eye(529,8)superior with increasing(1286,9), but at last seemed
struck(2042,8)thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. (1215,8)
Ahab, I have heard of(1165,10)—but it was not(306,11)that took off
thy leg?”

“Who told thee that?(679,12); then pausing, “Aye,(328,9); aye, my
hearties all round;(138,8)(134,15)dismasted me;(163,15)
brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he(1402,8)
(358,8)errific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;
“(95,8)!(340,8)that accurse(824,8)(1484,8)at razeed me; made a poor
pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with
measureless imprecations(251,11) out: (184,11)and I’ll chase him
round Good Hope, (1250,10)the Horn(20,16)Norway Maelstrom,
(1302,10)perdition’s flames(1697,8)I give him up. And this is what ye
have shipped for, men! to chase (1943,17)on both sides of land,
and over all(28,10)earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin
out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do
look brave.”
(580,11)”(421,9)(1512,11)eers and seamen, running closer to the
excited old man: “A sharp eye for the(656,12); a sharp lance for
(1310,14)God bless (831,9)eemed to half sob and half shout. (54,14)
men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long
face about, Mr.(1116,11)wilt thou not(531,9)(233,13)? art not
game for(1575,10)?”

“I am (28,9)his crooked jaw, and(320,9)jaws of Death too, (1400,14)if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I
came here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many
barrels will thy(37,10) yie(1475,8)even if thou gettest it(205,14)? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”

“(21,16)! Hoot! But come closer(1572,12)thou requirest a
little lower layer. If money’s to be the(578,8)r, man, and the
accountants have comp(860,8)ir great counting-house the globe, by
girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,
let me tell thee, that m(410,12)will fetch a great premium _here!_”

“He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “(830,9)at for? methinks it
rings most vast, but hollow.”

“V(559,9)on a dumb brute!(2034,8)(2008,8), “that simply smote thee
from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with(107,8)thing,
Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”

“Hark ye yet again—the (567,20)All visible objects, man,
are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the
undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth
the mouldings of its features from behind the un(75,10)mask. If man
will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach
outside except by thrusting(73,13)wall? To me,(1630,16) is
that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes(1821,9)there’s naught beyond.
But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous
strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That(37,12)
thing is chiefly what I hate; and(1168,8)(261,12)agent, or be the
(290,12)principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me
of(783,9)y, man; I’d(493,10)e sun if it insulted me. For could the
sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of
fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my
mast(1475,9)is even that (94,9). Who’s over me? Truth hath no
confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is
a doltish stare! So, so(1698,9)ddenest and palest; my heat has melted
thee to anger-glow. But look ye(1787,10), what is said in heat, that
thing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small
indignity. I meant(583,8)incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder
Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living, breathing pictures painted by
the sun. The Pagan leopards—(1231,8)cking and unworshipp(1322,9)s,
that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!
The crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this
matter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! S(332,9) Chilian! he
snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one
tost sapling cannot(604,10)! And(608,9)it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to
help(1579,8)a fin; no wondrous feat for(2044,9). W(85,9) more? From
this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely
he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a
whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize the(1582,8)! the billow lifts thee!
Speak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence(225,8)_that_ voices thee.
(_Aside_) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in
his lungs.(1079,9) now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without
rebellion.”

“God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured(1181,11)lowly.

But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence(795,8)mate, Ahab
did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the
hold(37,14)presaging vibrations(923,9)inds in the cordage; nor
(99,8)hollow flap(976,8)sails against the masts, as for a moment
their hearts sank in. For again(1512,9)’s downcast eyes lighted up
with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the
winds blew on;(197,11)filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as
before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?
But rather are ye predictions than(75,9), ye shadows! Yet not so
much(55,13)from(722,8), as verific(492,14)forego(1588,10)
with(401,8)with little external to(1058,10) us, the innermost
necessities in our being, these still drive us on.

“The measure! t(13,11)” cried Ahab.

Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
ordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him
near the capstan, (656,8)ir(113,8)(832,8)ir hands, while his three
mates stood at his side(76,12)lances, and the rest(880,9)hip’s
company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant
searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his,
as the bloodshot eye(1105,9)prairie wolves meet the ey(1268,8)ir
leader, ere he rushes on at(347,8)ead(1175,8)trail(1329,8)bison; but,
alas! only to fall in(525,8)idden snar(1389,9)Indian.

“Drink and pass!” he cried, hand(630,8)heavy charged flagon to the
nearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short
draughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it goes
round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this
way it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
(998,9)life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!

“Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all(813,9)is(979,8); and
ye mates, flank me with you(925,8); and y(1129,15)stand there
(50,10)iron(49,9), stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some
sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers(1204,8)me. O men,
you will yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.
(459,10). Why, now, this pewter had run(1444,10)again, wer’t not
thou St. Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!

“Advance, (397,8)! Cross(389,12) full(238,12)(683,9)! Let me
touch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three
level, radiating(126,8)(1185,9)crossed centre; while so doing,
suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from
Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some
nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked(1358,9)m the
same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar(1623,8)own
magnetic life. T(365,8) mates quailed(1918,10)s strong, sustained,
and mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest
eye of (351,9)fell downright.

“In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did y(213,8)but
once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, _that_
had perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped
ye dead(47,11) ye need it not. Down lances! A(1365,8)(1307,10)I do
appoint(234,10)cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three
most honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant(1398,12). Disdain
the task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using
his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension,
_that_ shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your
seizings and draw the poles,(1657,15)!”

Silently obeying the order,(1227,10)(1710,12) now stood with the
detached iron part of their(1769,8)s, som(942,8)feet long, held, barbs
up,(955,10)m.

“Stab me not(111,8)at keen steel! Cant them; c(11,8) over! know ye
not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so;(690,9)cup-bearers,
advance. The irons!(919,9)m; hold them while I fill!” Forthwith,
slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed th(438,9)
sockets(379,9) fiery waters from the pewter.

“Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow
them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!(1669,9)! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
it. Drink(718,17) drink and swear, ye men that man the
deathful whaleboat’s bow—Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do
not hunt(46,10) to his death!” The long, barbed steel goblets were
lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the
spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.(1716,10)pal(1811,8)turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished
pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free
hand to them, they all dispers(298,8)Ahab retired within his cabin.


CHAPTER 37. Sunset.

_The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out_.

I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I
sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them;
but first I pass.

Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like wine.
The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes
down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then,
the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it
bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but
darkly feel(133,12) that, that dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that
I know—not gold. ’Tis split, too—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me
so, my brain seems to beat(1081,13)solid metal; aye, steel skull,
mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!

Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred
me, so(33,8)set soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not
me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted
(1898,9)high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most
subtly and most malignantly! damned(352,9)idst of Paradise! Good
night—good night! (_(1345,11)hand, he moves from the window_.)

’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder(1563,10)
stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the
match itself mus(765,8)be wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and
w(34,9)willed, I’ll do! They think me mad—(1923,9)does; but I’m
demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild(28,9)that’s only calm to
comprehend itself! The prophecy was(1346,8)should be dismembered;
and—Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophes(1417,10)ill(66,10) my
(79,10)r. Now, then, be t(140,9)t(529,8) fulfiller one. That’s
more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye
cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I
will not say as schoolboys do to bullies—Take some one of your own
size; don’t pommel _me!_ No, ye’ve knocked me down, and I am up again;
but _ye_ have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your cotton bags!
I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab’s compliments to ye; come
and see if ye can swerve me. S(11,8)? ye cannot(32,10), else ye
swerve yourselves! man has ye ther(77,14)The path to my fixed
purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.
Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under
torrents’ beds, unerringly I rush! Naught’s an obstacle, n(22,10)
angle to the iron way!


CHAPTER 38. Dusk.

_By the Mainmast; (1117,9)leaning against it_.

M(258,10)(864,10)matched; she’s overmanned; and by a madman!
Insufferable sting, that sanity(1108,8)ground arms on such a field! But
he drilled deep(755,11)blasted all my reason out of me! I think I
see his impious end; but feel(1254,8)must help him to it. Will I, nill
I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have
no knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who’s over him, he cries;—aye, he
w(1427,8)a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below!
Oh! I plainly see my miserable office,—to obey, rebelling; and worse
yet, to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid wo(212,8)shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow
wide. The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the
small gold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God
may wedge aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole
clock’s run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, (1470,10)key to
lift again.

[_A burst of revelry from the forecastle_.]

Oh, God! to sail with(942,8)heathen crew that have small(521,9)
human mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white
whale is their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that(230,9)is
forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life.
Foremost(1535,13)sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled,
bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods
within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake,
and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills
me(1802,8)! Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! Oh, life! ’tis in
an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,—as wild,
untutored things are forced to feed—(125,15)now(1551,8)do feel
the latent horror in thee! but(55,8)t me! tha(38,8)’s(1675,11)
and with the soft feeling(390,8)human in me, yet will I try to fight
ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye
blessed influences!


CHAPTER 39. First Night-Watch.

Fore-Top.

(_Stubb solus, and mending a brace_.)

Ha! ha! h(8,8)em! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it ever
since, and(1111,8), ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a
laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer(1845,8)that’s queer; and come what
will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing(37,8) is, it’s all
predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor
eye(29,9) then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure
the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the
gift, might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon
his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, _wise_ Stubb—that’s my title—well,
Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know(377,9)that may be
coming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,
skirra! W(241,9)juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes
out?—Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as
a frigate’s pennant, and so am I—f(191,13) (191,8)Oh—


We’ll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love, as gay and fleeting
As bubbles that swim,(1884,8)beaker’s brim, And break(1916,8)lips while
meeting.



A brave stave that—who calls? Mr.(910,9)? Aye, aye, sir—(_Aside_)
he’s my superior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—(79,13),
just(1855,8)(1582,8)is job—coming.(1452,11)40. Midnight, Forecastle.

HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.

(_Foresail rises and discovers(1941,10) standing, lounging, leaning,
and lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus_.)


  Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!(43,27)
  ladies of Spain! Our captain’s commanded.—



1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don’t be sentimental; it’s bad for the
digestion! Take a tonic, follow me!

(_Sings, and all follow._)


(167,12) stood upon the deck, A spy-glass in his hand, A viewing of
 those gallant whales That blew at every strand. Oh, your tubs in your
 boats, my boys, And by your braces stand, And we’ll have one of those
 fine whales, Hand(345,8)over hand! So, be cheery, my lads! may your
(1037,8)never fail! While the bol(1191,10)r is striking the whale!



MATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!

2ND(557,19)Avast the chorus!(69,18)! d’ye hear,
bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me
call(920,10). I’ve the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So,
so, (_thrusts his head down the scuttle_,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!
(312,17) below! Tumble up!

DUTCH(869,9)Grand snoozing(1535,9), maty; fat night(196,9). I mark
this in our old Mogul’s wine; it’s quite as deadening to some as
filliping to others. We sing; they sleep—aye, lie(272,9)re, like
ground-tier butts. At ’em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail
’em(1499,9)it. Tell ’em to avast dreaming of their lasses(44,10)
it’s the resurrection; they must kiss(61,10)t, and come to judgment.
Tha(74,8)way—_that’s_ it; thy throat ain’t spoiled with eating
Amsterdam butter.

FREN(502,11)Hist, boys! let’s have a jig or two before we ride to
anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other(799,8)Stand
by all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!

PIP. (_Sulky and sleepy._) Don’t know where it is(252,18)Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I
say; merry(412,8)ord; hurrah! Damn me, won’t you dance? Form, now,
Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves!
Legs! legs!

ICELAND(1842,9)I don’t like your floor(973,8)it’s too springy to my
taste. I’m used to ice-floors. I’m sorry to throw cold water on the
subject; but excuse me.

MALTESE(2005,9)Me too; where’s your girls? Who but a fool would take
his left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d’ye do? Partners!
I must have p(22,9)

LONG-IS(419,13)Well, well, ye sulkies, there’s plenty more of us.

TASHTEGO. (_Quietly smoking._) That’s a white man; he calls that fun:
humph! I save my sweat.

OLD MANX(1349,11)wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what
they are dancing over. I’ll dance over your grave, I will—t(2032,9)
bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round
corners. O Christ! to think of the green navies(926,8) green-skulled
crews!(1196,11); belike the whole world’s a ball, as you scholars
have it; and so ’t(1459,8) to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads,
you’re young; I was once.

3D NANTUCKET(2014,9)Spell oh!—whew! this is worse than pulling after
whales in a calm—give us a whiff, Tash.

(_They ceas(485,9)(1990,8)ther in clusters. Meantime the sky
darkens—(1284,8) rises_.)

LASCAR(1990,9)By Brahma! boys, it’ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born,
high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!(1970,18)(_Reclining and shaking his cap_.) It(1501,8)aves—the
snow’s caps turn to jig it now. They’ll shake their tassels soon. Now
would all(94,10) were (778,9)en I’d go drown, and chassee with
them evermore! There’s naught so sweet on earth—heaven may not match
it!—as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the
over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.

SICILIAN(402,20)_.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad—fleet
interlacings(1035,8)limbs—lithe swayings—coyings—flutterings! lip!
heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,
else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (_Nudging_.)

TAHIT(250,22) on a mat_.) Hail, holy nakedness of our
(1424,8)girls!—the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I
still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven
in the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn
and wilted quite. Ah me!—not thou nor I can bear the change! How then,
if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from
Pirohitee’s peak of spears(758,10)y leap down the crags and drown the
villages?—The blast! t(11,10)Up, spine, and meet it! (_Leaps to his
feet_.)

CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.

I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;
my oath had been welded(39,9)irs; and stronger I shouted, and more
did I hammer and clinch my oath, because(903,8)dread in my soul. A
wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud
seemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history(313,9)murderous
monster against whom I an(774,9) others had taken our oaths of
violence and revenge.

For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
frequented(1661,8)Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of
his existence; only a few(42,8), comparatively, had knowingly seen
him; while the number who as yet had actually an(65,12)given
battle to him, wa(903,8)indeed. For, owing to the larg(108,9)of
whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire
watery circumference, man(1657,8)m adventurously pushing their quest
along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth
or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any
sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity
of the times of sailing from home;(1620,8)se, with other circumstances,
direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole
world-wide whaling-fleet(1170,8)special individualizing tidings
concerning(1414,11) It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels
reported to have(405,10)ed, at such or such a time, or on(27,8)
such a meridian, a(965,13)of uncommon magnitude and malignity,
which(2040,8)after doing great mischief to his assailants, had
completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair
presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other
than(396,12)Yet as of late(1243,23)y(1769,10)marked
by various and not un(1318,8) instances of great ferocity, cunning, and
malice in the (1599,9)ttacked; therefore it was(244,9)ose who by
accident ignorantly gave (1258,10)(637,9); such hunters, perhaps,
for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,
more, as it were,(1348,8)perils(1995,8)(356,20)at large,
than(1404,8)(859,10) cause. In that way, most(1780,8)disastrous
(1205,10)between Ahab and(560,11)had hitherto been popularly
regarded.

And as for(376,10), previously hearing(1045,8)(1891,11), by chance
caught sight of him;(505,8)beginn(68,11)t(1512,8)y had every one
(1835,9)almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him,(196,8)any
other w(1017,8)that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue
in these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken
limbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal(1935,10)st degree of
fatality; those repeated(528,11) repulses, all accumulating and
pil(1880,10)terrors upo(1067,11)(94,8)things had gone far to shake
the fortitude of many brave(884,10)to whom the stor(2030,8) White
W(668,9)eventually come.

Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
horrify the true historie(929,8)se deadly(2047,10)s. For not only do
fabulous(139,8)naturally grow ou(1833,9)very body(175,9)urprising
terrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in
maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma,(329,12)
abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.(1069,8)the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so(1731,11)fishery
(56,10)every other sort of (235,15)in the wonderfulness and
fea(16,9)of the(565,8)which sometimes circu(1794,8)re(491,14)
are whalemen as a body unexempt from tha(1667,9)ce and
superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but(716,9)ailors, they
are by all odds(1703,10)directly brought into contact with whatever is
appallingly astonishing(1917,8)sea; face to face they(752,10)eye its
greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, gi(1919,13)them. Alone, in such
remotest water(2010,11)ugh you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a
(29,9)shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or
aught hospitable beneath that par(969,9)sun;(195,8) latitudes and
longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does,(1933,10)man is
wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many
a mighty birth.

No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume(718,8)e mere transit over
the wid(438,9)y spac(201,8)outblown(1434,11)(1495,9) Whale did in
the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and
half-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which
(1628,11)invested(1772,10) with new(1804,10)nborrowed from anything
that visibly appears. So that in many cases(520,8)panic did he finally
strike, that few who by(2003,8)umors, at least, had heard(1853,19), few of thos(1913,9) were willing to(1754,10) the perils of his
jaw.

But there were still other and more vital practical(695,13)t work.
Not even at the present day has the original prestige(1851,8)Sperm(217,8)as fearfully distinguish(408,9)(161,9)spec(2000,10)
leviathan, died(1948,12)mind(1568,9)(1511,18). There are
those this day among them, who,(1214,8)intelligent and courageous
enough in offering(1320,14) Greenland or Right whale, would
perhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
timidity, decline a contest(902,9) Sperm Whale; at any rate, there
are plenty of(1822,9), especiall(287,10)ose whaling nations not
sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely(699,10)ed
(173,15), but whose sole knowled(593,10)(523,9) is
restricted(385,8)ignoble monster primitively pursued(1843,8)North;
seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
fireside interest and awe,(533,8)wild, strange tales of Southern
whaling. Nor is(869,8)-eminent tremendousnes(1433,9)great(489,12)
anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on bo(1152,9)ose prows
which stem him.

And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
naturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declaring(755,16) not only to
be a consternation to every other creature(537,8)sea, but also to be
so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.
Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost
similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron
himself affirms that at sigh(1367,9)(916,13)all fish (sharks
included) are “stru(1912,8)the most lively(1924,8),” and “often in the
precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with
such violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however the general
(1399,10)s(1057,8)fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in
their full terribleness, even(1570,8)bloodthirsty item of(723,9), the
superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitud(1835,9)ir
vocation, reviv(1265,10)(1835,13)hunters.

So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few
of(308,11)men recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days(71,8)(973,12)fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
practised(1925,12)men to embark(1542,8)perils of this new and daring
warfare; such men protesting that although other(1695,10)(1299,8)be
hopeful(1666,10), yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
as(1255,17)was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be
inevitab(1198,9)torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are
some remarkable documents that may be consulted.

Nevertheless, some there were, who ev(1051,9) fac(2035,8)se things
were ready to give chas(597,14); and a still greater number who,
chancing(1571,8) hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
specific details of any certain calamity, and(58,9)(982,13)
accompaniment(1517,8)sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offered.

On(304,8) wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
(1477,9)White Whal(1817,9)(1089,13)(1190,13)ly inclined, was
the unearthly conceit that(1023,10) was ubiquitous; that he had
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
instant of time.

Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this(191,8)
altogether(470,10)ome faint show of(489,14) probability. For as
the secret(1423,9)current(1660,9)seas have never yet been divulged,
(1622,12)most erudite research; so the hidden way(1535,9)Sperm
Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to
his pursuers; and from time to time have originated(182,10)curious
and contradictory specula(708,8)garding them, especial(606,8)rning
the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he
transports himself with such vast swiftness(377,13)widely(1083,8)
points.

It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and
as well(73,9)placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,
that some whales(748,10) captured far north(1824,8)Pacific, in whose
bodi(61,13)found the barbs of harpoons darted(1901,8)Greenland
seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in som(1544,11)instances it has
been declared that the interval(1018,8) between the two assaults could
not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been
believed by(356,11)men,(151,10)Nor’ West Passage, so long a
problem to man, was never a (28,11)the whale. So(1330,8)re, in the
real living experience of(21,8)men, the prodigies related in old
time(1511,9)inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there
was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the
surface); and that still more wonderful story(1793,8)Arethusa fountain
near Syracuse (whose waters were (447,9)to have com(1906,11)Holy
Land by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost
fully equalled by the realiti(376,10)(575,8).

Forced into familiarity, then,(1187,11)(466,10)as these; and
knowing that after repeated, intrepid(788,9),(2047,17)had
escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise (1137,15)men
should go still further in their(1854,12)ns; declaring Moby Dick not
only ubiquitous, but immortal (for(14,9)ity is but(49,8)y in
time);(1076,8)ough groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he
would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he(84,8)ever be made to
spout thick blood, such a sight w(138,8)but a ghastly deception; for
again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied
je(113,8)once more be seen.

But even stripped(1441,10)supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
the earthly make and incontestable character(1167,8)monster to strike
the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his
uncommon bulk(692,8) much distinguished him from other sperm whales,
but, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled
forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent
features; the tokens whereby, even(2009,8)limitless, uncharted seas, he
revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.

The rest of his body was so streaked, and spott(13,8)marbled with the
same shrouded hue, that(1778,8) end, he had gained his distinctive
appellation(1752,8)(1248,11); a name, indeed, literally justified by
his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spang(275,9)golden
gleamings.

Nor was it his(765,10)magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
deformed lower jaw,(783,14)invested(1697,10) with natural
terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
specific accounts(478,9)over an(9,8)gain evinc(1433,10)(1733,8).
More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than
perhaps aught else. For(503,8)wimming before his exulting pursuers,
with every apparent symptom of alarm(704,9)several times been known
to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their
boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to(1952,8)hip.

Already(177,9)fatalities had attended his chase. Bu(1897,9)similar
disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual(1608,8)fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed(1024,16)’s
infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death
that he caused,(1644,9)wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
un(811,12)agent.

Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of
his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed
boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the
white curds(2014,8)whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating
sunlight(1196,8)miled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.

His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
dashed at(1373,10), as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly
seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life(402,10)ale. That(202,8) was Ahab. And then it was(1564,8)uddenly sweeping
his sickle-shap(1616,12) beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away
Ahab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk,
no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming
malice. Small reason was there to doubt(923,9)(1062,8) since that
almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness
agains(539,14)ll the more fell for that(1803,8)frantic morbidness
he at last came to identify wi(408,8)not only all his bodily woes, but
(25,8)intellectual and spiritual(932,11)ons. T(1395,14) swam
(1849,9)m as the monomaniac inca(1662,8)of all those malicious
agencies which some deep men feel eat(938,10)m, till they are left
living on with half a heart and(17,8)lung. That intangible malignity
which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern
Christians ascribe one-half(1315,9)orlds; which the ancient Ophites of
the east reverenced in(1986,8)tatue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and
worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the
abhorred whit(1239,9)he pitted himself, all mutilated, (753,8)it. All
that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;
all truth with malice in it(67,11)cracks(1752,8)ews and cakes the
brain(115,8)e subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy
Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby
Dick. He piled upon(1869,13)white hump the sum(848,10)e general
rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down;(2048,8)(1900,8)
his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it.

It is not probable that this(1058,10) in him took its instant rise at
the precise time of(1230,12)dismemberment. Then, in darting at the
monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,
corporal animosity; and when he received the strok(246,8)ore him, he
probably but felt the agonizing(1450,8)laceration, but nothing more.
Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long
months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in
one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian
Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one
another; and so interfusing, made him mad(1539,8)t was only then, on
the homeward voyage, after the(2041,12)that the final(1782,10)
seized him, seems all but certai(1625,11)fact that, at intervals
during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a
leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was
moreover intensified(1113,8)delirium(432,11)mates were(650,10)
lace him fast,(1845,9)re, as he sailed,(222,8)in his(600,8). In a
strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings(1899,8)gales. And, when
running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails
spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,
the old man’(332,10) seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn
swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and
air;(404,9)n,(1233,9)bore that firm, collected front, however pale,
and issued his calm orders once again; and(553,11)thanked God the
direful madness was now gone(165,13)Ahab,(553,9)idden self,
raved on. Human(75,9)is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.
When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigur(1174,8)some
still subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly
contracted; like the unabated Hudso(439,8)that noble Northman flows
narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in hi(70,8)-flowing(1996,10), not one jot of(229,8)broad(462,9)had been
(733,11); so in that(47,14)(84,17)his great natural
intellect had perishe(1507,8)before living agent, now became th(29,8)
instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his specia(450,8)
stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its
concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost
his(1507,9)(803,8)to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold
more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one
reasonable object.

This is much; yet(775,8)larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.
But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding
far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where
we here stand—(1297,8)grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your
way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;
where far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root
of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique
buried(138,9)antiqu(414,11)throned on torsoes! So with a broken
throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he
patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of
ages. Wind ye down there, ye proud(439,16)! question that
proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young
exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old
State-secret come.

Now(1858,10)eart, Ahab had some glimpse(777,8), namely: all my means
are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or
change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind(305,8)long
dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing(1624,8)(58,8)ing
was only subject to his perceptibility, no(27,9)will determinate.
Nevertheless, so well did he succeed(1784,9)(126,11), that when
with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him
otherwise than bu(1855,9)ly grieved(918,8)at to the quick, with the
terrible casualty which had overtaken him.

The repor(1974,9)undeniable delirium at sea was(481,10)popularly
ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which
always afterward(1359,8)e very day of sailing in the Pequod on the
present voyage, sat broo(1094,12)brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,
(1973,14)distrusting his fitness for another whaling(120,9)on
account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent
isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for(1664,8)ery reasons
he was(383,9)better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full
of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed(1973,8)and
scorched(1121,8)(696,10) infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable
idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem(585,10)man to dart
his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.
Or, if for an(375,8)(985,9)to be corporeally incapacitated for that,
yet(210,12)(190,12)superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
(967,8)rlings(1063,8)attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,
that(415,10)mad secre(1067,11)abated rage bolted up and keyed in
him(1709,11)purposely sailed upon the (956,14)(534,10)one
only and all-engrossing(1717,8)of hunting the White Whale. Had any one
of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking
in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have
wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on
profitable cruises, the profi(624,10)unted down in dollars from the
mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural
revenge.

Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses
a Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made
up of mongrel renegades, and castaway(15,9)nnibals—morally enfeebled
also, by the in(887,8)ce of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and reckless(71,10)ubb(2048,8)e pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such(292,9)so
officered, seemed specially picked and packed by(1394,8)fernal fatality
to help him to his monomaniac (532,8) How it was that they so
aboundingly responded(2026,8)old man’s ire—by what evil magic their
souls were possessed, that at times his hate(237,8)almost theirs; the
(1065,11) as much their insufferable foe as his; how(1338,10)came to
be—what(1149,16) wa(1405,8)m, or how to their unconscious
understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have
seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,—(1538,9)to
explain(1842,8)be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean
miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by
the ever shifting, muffled sound(1666,8)pick? Who does not feel the
irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand
still? For one, I gave myself up(1885,9)bandonment(365,8)time(940,8)
place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see
naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.


CHAPTER 42. T(1812,8)ness(523,8)Whale.

W(697,8)white w(697,12)Ahab, has been hinted; what,(873,9), he
was to me, as yet remains unsaid.

Aside(1663,8)ose more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there
was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,
which(1138,10)by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest;
and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost
despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. I(1430,8)e w(535,11)

whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an
elusive something(1346,8)innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more
of panic(1978,8)soul than that redness which affrights in blood.

This (143,8)quality it is(113,8)causes the thought of(1972,10), when
divorced from more kindly(321,15)and coupled with any object
terrible in itself, to heighten that terror(1606,8)furthest bounds.
Witness(1407,11)bear(1550,8)poles(636,10)white shark of the
tropics; what but(948,8)mooth, flaky(1818,11)makes them the
transcendent horrors they are? That ghastl(69,12)it is which
imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,(1301,8)dumb gloating(1418,10)aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged
tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage a(377,11)-shrouded
bear or shark.*

*With reference(1673,8)Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is(238,8)
(708,11)separately regarded(881,8)(639,8)s the intolerable
hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that(712,9)ed (58,11),
it might be said, only rises(1670,10)circumstance, that the
irresponsible feroci(148,13)e(1877,10)stands invest(1531,9)
fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together
two such opposite emotions in our minds,(492,15) fr(353,8)us
with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;
yet, were it not for(1042,10)ness, you would not have that intensified
terror.

As(67,14) shark,(1126,11)gliding ghostli(532,8)repose in that
(395,8), when beheld(866,8)ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
sam(1454,11)n(830,11)quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly
hit by the Frenc(2007,9)name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish
mas(285,10)dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence
_Requiem_ denominating the mass(1552,9)and any other funeral music.
Now, in allusion(1815,8)white, silent still(949,8)death in this shark,
(1568,8)mild dead(465,10)his habits,(313,12)call him _Requin_.

Bethink thee(1665,8)albatro(1847,8)ce come those clouds of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’s great,
unflattering laureate, Nature.*

*I remember th(90,8)(241,9) I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
gale, in waters hard(639,8)e Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
below, I ascended(1634,8)overclouded deck; and there, dashe(109,10)
main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted(1126,12)and
with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its
vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous
flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered
cries, as some king’s ghost in super(1465,8)distress. Through its
inexpressible(1253,9) eyes, methought I peeped to secrets(750,8)ook
hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself;(1544,10)
thing was so(1060,8)its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled
waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of
towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only
hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and
turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!
never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious
thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I
learned that goney w(713,8)seaman’s name for(1450,10). So that by no
possibility could(1358,10)’s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with
those mystical impression(740,8)were mine, when I saw t(382,9)upon
our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to
be an(238,12)Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a
little brighter the noble merit(1789,8)poem(1393,8) poet.

I assert, then, that in the wondrous(1170,8)(1368,9)(1870,8)bird
chiefly lurks the secre(118,9)spell; a truth the more evinced in
this,(484,9)a solecism of terms there are birds called grey
(2004,9)es(1616,9)se I have frequently seen, but never with such
emotions as(497,8)beheld(1782,15)fowl.

But how had th(586,8) thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will
tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.
At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern
tally round its neck, with the ship’s time and place(1981,9)n letting
it escape. But I doubt not, that(113,9) tally, meant for man, was
taken off in Heaven, when(1594,10)(269,8)ew to jo(688,8)ing-folding,
the invoking, and adoring cherubim!

Most famous in our Western annals and Indian(1591,12)is tha(858,8)
White Steed(877,8)Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and(405,10)dignity of a
thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the
elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures(1951,9)
days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains(1163,9)Alleghanies. At
their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
every evening leads(824,8)hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his
mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more
resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A
most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western
world, which to the eye(1491,9)old trappers and hunters revived the
glori(52,8)ose primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,
bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid
his aides and marshals(1729,8)van of countless cohorts that endlessly
streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or wheth(1599,8)his
circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White
Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through
his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to
the bravest Indians h(1066,9) object of trembling reverence and awe.
Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this
noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly(740,8)so
cloth(925,12)divineness(1732,8)at this(26,11) had that in it
which, though commanding worship,(476,8)same time enforced a certain
nameless terror.

But there are other instances where this(226,11)loses all that
accessory and strange glory which invests it(794,8)(1713,12)and
Albatross.

What is it(256,9)the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is
that(480,11)(211,14)him, a thing express(1650,10)name he
bears. T(199,10)is as well made as other men—has no substantive
deformity—and yet this mere(854,8)of all-pervading(660,11)makes him
more(420,8)ly hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be
so?

Nor, in quit(569,8)aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not
the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this
crowning attribute(1613,8)terrible. From its snowy aspect, the
gauntleted ghost(1674,8)Southern Seas has been denominated(1342,12)quall. (277,8)some historic(848,10), has the art of human malice
omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of
that passage in Froissart, when, masked(1700,8)snowy symbol of their
facti(1569,8)desperat(951,8)Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the
market-place!(564,10)some thing(556,8)the common, hereditary experience of all
mankind(539,9)bear witness to the supernaturalism(1484,8) hue. It
cannot well be doubted,(1416,8)e one visible quality(2004,8)(877,9)
the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
there; as if indeed that(42,8)were as much like the badge of
consternation(1373,8)other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And
from(117,13)of (221,8), we borrow the(1251,8)ive hu(873,8)
shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail
to th(106,8)sam(670,8)mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in
a milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that
even the king of(52,8), when personifi(1518,10)evangelist, rides on
his pallid horse.

Therefore, in hi(1531,9)oods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
thing he will by(1951,10), no man can deny(1862,9)its profoundest
idealized significance it calls up a(1897,9) apparition(871,9)oul.

But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is(659,8)man to
account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by
the citation of some of those(1416,10) wherein this thing of
(2021,9)—though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,
but nevertheless, is found to exert over us(814,11)orcery, however
modified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
to the hidden cause we seek?

Let us try. But in a matter(1203,8)is, subtlety appeals to(20,9),
and(575,9)imagination(717,12)follow another into these halls. And
though, doubtless, some at lea(2015,10)(100,9)ve impressions about
to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
entirely conscious of them at(602,9), and t(1046,8) may not be able
to recall them now.

Why(1775,8)man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
acquainted with the(1008,10)characte(1551,10)ay(1965,11)bare
men(874,8)Whitsuntide marshal(1843,8)fancy such long, dreary,
speechless proc(387,8)of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded

Friar or(17,8) Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue(1971,8)soul?

Or what is there apart from the tradit(293,8)dungeoned warriors and
kings (which will not(1207,8)(1384,14)) that makes the White Tower
of London tell so much more strongly on(846,14)on of an
untravelled(337,9), than those other storied structures, its
neighbors—the Byward Tower, or (1949,9)Bloody? And those sublimer
towers,(216,11)Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in(1779,9)
moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over(1809,9)(985,8)(800,16)that name, while the thought of Virginia’s Blue Ridge is
full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all
latitudes and longitudes(978,11)na(1836,8)(520,8)Sea exert such a

reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does “the tall pale man”
of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides
through the green(1773,8)groves—why is this phantom more terrible than
all the whooping imp(1721,8) Blocksburg?

Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
earthquakes; nor the stampedoes(58,8)frantic sea(40,10)
tearlessness of arid ski(941,8)never rain(92,11)ight(145,8)wide
field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop
(like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of
house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;—it
is not these things alone which make (315,8) Lima, the strangest,
saddest city thou can’st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and
there is a higher horror in this white(444,8)her woe. Old as Pizarro,
(43,15)keeps her ruins for ever new; admit(256,9) cheerful
green(551,8)complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid
pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.

I know that,(1093,8)common apprehension,(922,8)enomenon of(294,10)(473,8)conf(1167,9)be the prime agent in exaggerat(1175,8)terror of
objects otherwis(1020,10); nor(1251,8)un(2002,9)ve mind is there
a(1715,8)te(464,10)ose appearances whose awfulness to another mind
almost solely consists(540,9)one(264,11), especially when
exhibited under any form at all approaching to mu(618,8)r
universality. What I mean by(822,8)wo statements may perhaps be
(1885,10)ly elucidat(1676,10)following examples.

First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if
by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels
just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under
precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to
view his ship sailing (1734,8)a midnight sea of milky(1080,10)—as if
from encircling headlands shoal(1012,8)bed white bears were swimming
round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded
(1876,8)of(1298,10)ned waters is ho(1897,8)o him as a real ghost; in
vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm
they both go down; he(1809,8)ests till blue water is under him again.
Yet w(1479,8)t(700,10) who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much
the fear of striking hidden rocks, as (38,12)that hideous
(1575,10)that so stirred me?”

Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual si(1219,8)he
snow-howdahed Andes conveys n(1261,9)dread, except,(1040,8), in the
mere fancying(513,8)eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
altitudes, and(210,8)ural conceit of what a fear(1377,8)it would be to
lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the
backwoodsman(725,8)West, who with comparative indifference views an
unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig
to break the fixed trance(1828,13). Not so the sailor, beholding
the scenery(932,8)Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal
trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and
half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his
misery, views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with
its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.

But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about(1466,10) is
but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a
hypo, Ishmael.

Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
Vermont, far remov(1730,8)all be(1955,8)prey—why is it that upon the
sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behi(1672,8)so that
he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why
will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in
phrensies of affright? T(1565,8)no remembrance in him of any gorings of
wild creatures in his green northern home(255,9) the strange
(212,9) he(248,8)cannot recall(1880,9)nything associa(1135,9)the
experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt,
of the black bisons of distant Oregon?

No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinc(1702,9)knowledge(1629,8)demonism(1149,8)world. Though thousands of miles from
Oregon, still when(331,11)that savage musk, the rending, goring
bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal(1903,8)prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.

Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rust(36,8)
the festooned frosts of mountains;(200,8)olate shift(97,8)the
windrowed snows of(1761,8)s; all these, to(1184,8),(303,8)the shaking
of that(1031,14)to the frightened colt!

Though neither knows where lie the nameless th(272,8)(361,8)e mystic
sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as(824,9) colt, somewhere
those(103,8)must exist(644,9)in many of its aspects this visible
world seems formed in lov(775,9)visible spheres were(43,10)
fright.

But not yet have we solved the incantation of this(1680,10), and
learned why it appeals wi(289,8)power(738,8)soul; and mor(1187,10)and far more portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most
meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very vei(866,9)Christian’s Deity; and yet should be as it is(1134,8)tensifying agent
in(578,8)(151,8) appalling to mankind.

I(1789,10)by its indefin(2030,9)t shadow(623,8)the heartless voids
and immensitie(871,8) universe, and thus stabs us from(1843,8)(1502,9)thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depth(113,9)milky
way? Or is it, that as in essence(573,10) is not so much a colour as
the(747,8) abs(1652,8)colour; and (1763,8)ame time the concrete of all
colours; is it for these reasons(1835,9)re is such(1620,9)lankness,
full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—(200,8)less, all-colour
of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory(1857,8)natural philosophers(370,8)ll other earthly hues—every stately
or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,
and the gilded velvets of butterflies(646,8)e(21,9)y cheeks of
young girl(1539,12) are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent
in substances, but only laid on from without; so(299,10)deified
Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover
nothing but the charnel-house within; a(488,11)proceed further, and
(509,14)(1665,10)al cosmetic which produces every one of her
hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless
in itself, and if operating(334,8) medium upon matter, would touch all
objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all
th(1404,8)palsied(1258,9) lies before us a leper; and like wilful
travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring
glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at
the monumental white shroud that wraps(786,8) prospect around him. And
of(822,11)(1661,11)Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then(143,8)fiery hunt?


CHAPTER 43. Hark!

“HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”

It(116,9)middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in
a cordon, extending from(748,8)the fresh-water butts in the waist, to
the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the
buckets to fill (84,16). Standing,(1643,8) most part, on the
hallowed precinct(1972,9)quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak
or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the (186,8)went in the
deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail(1489,9)
steady hum(398,8)unceasingly advancing keel.(534,9)in(537,8)st of this repose, that Archy,(486,12)cordon,
whose post was(457,10)after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a
Cholo, the words above.

“Hist! d(736,34)“Take(350,11), will ye, Archy? w(792,9) d’ye mean?”

“There it is again—under the hatches—don’t(868,10)it—a cough—it
sounded like a cough.”

“Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.(141,10)again—t(153,10)!—it sound(1792,8)wo or three sleepers turning
over, now!”

“Caramba! have done, shipmate(296,9)? It’s the(85,8)oaked biscuits
ye eat for supper(110,8) over inside of ye—(1914,8)else. Look to(950,11)!”

“Say what ye will(149,10); I’ve sharp ears.”

“Aye, you are(2000,8)p, ain’t y(682,8)heard the(773,12)old
Quakeress’s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re
(121,8).”

“Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark y(1421,9), there is somebody
down(1317,8)after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I
suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell
Flask, one morning watch, that there wa(81,15)that sor(1225,9)wind.”

“Tish!(1264,11)!”(1732,12)4. The Chart.

Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
took place on the night succeedi(889,8)wild ratification of his
purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker(1485,8)transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea
charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating
himself(59,8)it(201,26)intently study the various
lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady
pencil trace additional courses over spaces that(239,8)were blank. At
intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein
were set down the seasons and places in which, on(270,8) former
voyages of(26,9)ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.

While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
head, continually rocked with the mo(739,8)the ship, and for ever
threw shifting gleam(499,10)ows of lines upon his(707,10)brow, till
it almost seemed that while he (656,8)was mark(790,8)(610,9)
(527,9)n th(807,11)(785,9)ome invisible pencil was also tracing(691,11)(608,8)upon the deeply mark(88,8) of his forehead.

But it was not this night in particular that,(1467,8)solitude(1100,8)cabin, Ahab thus pondered(444,9) charts. Almost every night they were
brought out;(352,8)(42,12)som(267,9)marks were effaced, and
others were substituted. For(553,10)charts of all four oceans before
him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to
the more certain accomplishment(1624,9)monomaniac though(427,9)soul.

Now, to any one not fully acquaint(775,12)ways(773,8)leviathans,
it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
creature(1993,8)unhooped(322,8)of this planet. But not so did it seem
to Ahab, who knew the se(407,10)tid(733,8)urrents; and thereby
calculating the drifting(252,9)(1186,11)’s food; and, also, calling
to mind the regular, ascertained(1331,9)for hunting him(803,14)
latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,(1089,8)approaching to
certainties, concern(225,8)timeliest day to be(1008,8)is or that
ground in search(1014,8)prey.

So assured, indeed, is the fact(116,16)periodicalnes(598,8)
(346,14)resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe
that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;
were the logs for one voyage(1543,8)entire whale fleet carefully
collated, then the migratio(715,8)(584,13) would be found to
correspond in invariability to thos(140,9)herring-shoals or the
flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct
elaborat(196,8)ory(1258,11)(786,15).*


  *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by
  an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury,(1956,8)National
  Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that(107,12)t
  appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and
  por(510,9)it are presented(1794,8)(228,8). “T(1759,9) divides the
  ocean into districts of five degrees of (1080,8) by(28,16)
  longitude; perpendicularly(787,8) each of which(108,11)are twelve
  columns for th(25,8) months; and horizontal(93,24)
 (95,16)hree lines; one to show the number of days that have
  been spent in each month in every(307,9),(1523,8) two others to
 (104,25)in which whales, sperm or right,(835,10)
  seen.”




Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another,(1307,16)s, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret
intelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in _veins_, as they are called;
continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating
exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one
tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the
direction taken(103,8)on(1500,8)be straight as a surveyor’s parallel,
and though the line of advanc(69,8)ictly confined to its own
unavoidable,(111,10)wake, yet the arbitrary _vein_(659,10)at these
times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width
(more or less(513,8) vein is presumed to expand or contract); but
never exceeds the visual sweep(635,10)whale-ship’s mast-heads, when
circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at
particular seasons within that breadth and(86,9)at path,(1968,8)ng
whales may with great confidence be looked for.

And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
(1039,14)s, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his
art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be
wholly without prospect of a meeting.

There was a circumstance(743,10)first sight see(648,8)ntangle his
delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so(1918,8)reality,
perhaps(1080,8) the gregarious (1419,12) have their reg(619,12)
for (642,11)(458,9)yet in(914,8) you cannot conclude that the
herds which haunted such an(9,8)(2026,10)or(2008,10) this year,
say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were
found there the preceding season;(1277,11)re are peculiar and
unquestiona(1702,8)ances w(83,9)contrary of this has proved true. In
general,(175,10)remark, only(990,8)a less wide limit, applies to the
solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged(499,13). So that
though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what
is called the Seychell(911,8)(669,8)Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on
the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow,(470,10) the Pequod to
visit either of those spots at any subsequent correspon(518,11), she
would infallibly(1192,13)m there. So, too, with some other feeding
(1274,9)where he had at times revealed(1159,8). But all these seemed
only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his
places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of accomplishing
his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to
whatever way-side, antecedent, extra(1378,9)s were his, ere a(1812,14)t time or place were attained, when all possibilities
would become proba(27,8), and, as Ahab fondly thought, every
(77,10)y the next thing to a certainty. That(1348,12)(178,9)and
(179,11)conjoine(815,9)one technical phrase—the
Season-on-the-Line. For(1208,8)nd th(939,8)several consecutive years,
(1012,14)been periodically descried, lingering i(1897,8)waters for
awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loi(53,8) a predicted
interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of
the dead(943,12)s(1548,8)e white whale had taken place;(1559,10)
waves were storied with his deeds(45,8)also was that tragic spot
(1553,10)monomaniac old man had (1675,9) awful motive to his
vengeance. But(2011,8)cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering
vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
hunt, he would not permit(1201,8) to rest all his hopes upo(707,9)
crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those
hopes; nor(1615,8)sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.

Now,(1642,12)had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of (953,24)No possible endeavor then could enable her
commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and
then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive(1984,8)equatorial
Pacific in time to cruise(1819,8)Therefore, he must wait for(1329,9)
ensu(1914,10). Yet the premature hour(1031,8)Pequod’s sailing had,
perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view (750,8)very
complexion of things. Because, an (1186,9)of three hundred and
sixty-five days and nights was before him;(76,13)which, instead
of impatiently enduring ash(327,8)would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;
if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote
from his(1556,11) feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow
of(444,8)rsian Gulf, (964,10)Bengal Bay, or China Seas(37,8)any
other(1650,8)haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,
Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,
might blow (1848,10)into the devious zig-zag world-circle(1021,8)(703,9)circumnavigating wake.

But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it
not but a mad idea, this; tha(1612,9)broad boundless ocean, one
solitary whale, even if(1874,10)ed(504,9)be thought capable of
individual recognition (593,9)hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti
in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar
snow-white brow of(448,10), and his (38,11)hump, c(1777,9)but be
unmistakable. And have I not tallied the(311,8)Ahab would mutter to
himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he
would throw(1927,9)back in reveries—(146,8)him, and shall he escape?
His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear!
And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a
weariness and faint(1998,8)pondering came(291,8)m; and(1682,8)open air
of the deck(1321,11)eek to rec(353,9)strength. Ah, God! what
trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one
unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes
with his own bloody nails in his palms.

Often, when forced(867,11)ammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
dreams(1893,8)night,(1692,8)resum(1582,8)own intens(1015,9)s through
the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them
round and (10,10)round(255,8)blazing brain, till the very throbbing
of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was
sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up
from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked
flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap
down among them; when this hell in(1102,9)yawned beneath him, a wild
cry w(1532,8)heard(514,8) the ship; and with glaring eyes(1298,11)
burst(1553,10)state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on
fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms
of some latent weakness, or fright at(913,9)resolve, were but the
plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the
scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter(938,8)white whale; this Ahab
that had gone to(1040,12), was not the agent that so caus(563,9)(418,12)it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living
principle or sou(610,8)(1472,9)sleep, being for the time dissociated
from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its
outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape (126,8)
scorching contiguity(1331,8)frantic thing, of(1342,8)(213,12), it
was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless
leagu(1653,8)the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s
case, yielding up all hi(888,8)t(1931,8)ncies(577,8)one supreme
purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced
itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent
being(879,8)own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common
vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken(541,10)unbidden and unfathered birth. T(414,8), the tormented spirit that
glared out of bodily eyes, when what(1589,8)Ahab rush(2035,12)room,
was(844,14)but a vacated(675,8)a formless somnambulistic being,
a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and
(665,10)a blankness in itself. God help thee, old man, thy(656,9)
have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus
makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that
(45,8)the very(141,10)h(163,8)s.


CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.

So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,
as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious
particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in
its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found(216,8)
volume;(1865,8) leading matter of it requires(639,8)till further and
more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,
and moreover to take away any incredulity(1653,8) profound ignorance of
the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity
of the main points of this affair.

I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from
thes(86,11), I take it—the conclusion aimed at will(311,8)ly
follow of(1116,8)

First: I have personal(146,10)hree instances where(159,8), after
receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
interval (in on(115,10) of three years), has been again struck by the
same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same
private cypher, have been ta(1746,12) body. In th(175,11)where
(178,11) intervened between the flinging of(155,9)harpoons; and I
think it may(137,11)something more than that; the man who darted
them happening,(1225,8)(369,8), to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far
into(130,10)ior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,
often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with
all the other common perils incident to wandering(1546,9)eart of
unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had(686,8)must also(607,10)
on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,
brushing with its flanks (229,8)coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.
This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the
other. I say I, myself, have(1118,23)similar to this;
that is in two of them I saw(349,10)s struc(2046,8)upon the second
attack,(52,9)(1029,9) with the respective marks cut in them,
afterwards(1028,16)dead fish(1033,9)three-year(1334,9), it so
fell out that I was(910,8)boat both times, first and last(360,9)
last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the
whale’s eye, which I had observed there(1402,12) previous. I say(1252,12), but I am pretty sure it was(1189,15). Here a(94,8)
(1629,9), then(144,10)(1677,15) the truth of; but(1718,8)heard
of many othe(381,10)s from persons whose veracity(1293,8)matter there
is no good ground to impeach.

Secondly: It is well known(1371,8)Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
the world(1357,8)may be of it, that there(1529,12)everal memorable
historical(1957,19)particular whale(1532,8)ocean(1864,11)t
distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became
thus(1876,8)was not al(1070,8) and originally owing to his bodily
(702,8)ities as distinguished from other whales; for(349,9)(764,8)
in that(984,8) any chanc(1423,8)may be, they soon put an end to his(140,15)by killing him, and boi(17,8) down into(900,11)ly
valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that(1111,10)fatal experiences
of the fishery(537,8)ung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
(434,13)as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most
fishermen were content to(1159,10) him by merely touching their
tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them (1493,9)a,
without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some
poor devils(900,8)that happen to know an irascible great man, they
make (830,8)unobtrusive salutations to him(1516,8)street, lest if they
pursued th(176,14) further, they might receive a summary thump
for their presumption.

But not only did each of these famous(1867,8)enjoy great individual
celebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown;(117,10)was he
famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and(1843,9)ions
of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it not
so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so
long did’st lurk(1689,8)Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was
oft seen(1098,10)palmy b(497,8)Ombay?(193,11) so, O New Zealand
Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the
vicinity of the Tattoo Land(124,19)Morquan! King of Japan,
whose lofty jet they say a(1704,9)ssumed the semblance of a snow-white
cross against the sk(260,20)Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale,
mark(451,11)old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In
plain prose, here are fou(1748,8) as well known to the students of
Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla(55,8)classic scholar.

But this i(1953,8)l.(513,12) Tom and(273,11), after at various
times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed
by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that
express object(1039,9)in view, as in setting out through the
Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture
that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the
Indian King Philip.

I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness(229,8)whole stor(1127,9)White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For
(775,8)one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full
(1596,8)bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of
the plainest and most palpable wonder(256,8) world, that without some
hints touching (86,9) facts, historical and otherwise,(575,8)fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still
worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.

First: Though most men have some vague flitting idea(285,9)general
peril(22,10)rand (223,9)y(1620,8)have nothing like a fixed, vivid
concep(761,8)those perils, and the frequency with(773,8)hey recur.
On(715,8) perhaps is, (1010,8) one in fif(1849,10)actual disasters
and deaths by casualti(1914,9)(221,10)ever finds a public record at
home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you
suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment(252,9)caught by
the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to
the bottom(1038,8)sea by the sounding leviathan—do you (195,12)
(195,16)’s name will appear(360,8)newspaper obituary you will
read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very
irregular between here and(268,11). In fact, did you ever hear what
might be called (85,8)news direct or indirect from(365,11)? Yet I
tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific,
among many others we spoke thirty different ships, every(1435,8)which
had had a death by a whale,(1351,8) them more than one(933,8)ree that
had each lost a boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your
lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of
man’s blood was spilled for it.

Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that(283,8)
is an enormous creature of(21,10)power; but I have ever found that
when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold
(126,8)ness,(1399,11)significantly complimented me upon my
facetiousness; when, I declar(39,9) soul, I had no more idea of
being (73,9) than Moses, when he wrote the histor(1416,9)plagues of
Egypt.

But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
malicious, as with(1065,8)aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy,
and sink a large ship; and what is more, t(191,8) Whale _has_ done it.

First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,
was cruising(1832,8)Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her
boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of(1774,10)s were wounded(725,8)suddenly, a very large whale escaping
from the boats, issued (23,9)shoal, and bore directly down upon the
ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that
in less than “ten minutes” she settl(1962,8)and fell over. Not a
surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest
exposure, part(2047,8)crew reached the land in their boats. Being
returned home at last(600,17) once more sai(1448,8)(1766,11)
in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon
unknown rocks and breakers;(112,9)second time his ship was(908,8)
lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since.
At this day(270,17)is a resi(1194,8)(883,9).(1603,8)seen
Owen Chace, who was chief mat(1970,8) Essex at the ti(1995,9) tragedy;
I have read his plain and faithful(1694,8)ve;(1733,8)conversed with his
son; and all this within a few miles(1528,8)scen(163,9)catastrophe.*

*The following are extracts from Chace’s(150,10): “Every fact seemed
to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
directed his operations; he made two(1154,9)attacks(1028,9) ship, at
a short interval between them, both of which, according to their
direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made
ahead, and thereby combin(693,9)peed(539,9)wo objects(907,8)
shock; to effect(176,8)the exact manœuvres which(294,9)were
necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated
resentment and fury. He cam(1413,11)(1447,14) which we had just
before entered, and in(41,14)struck three of his companions, as
if fir(764,8)revenge(1205,8)ir sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the
whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes,
and producing,(1003,12), impressions in my mind of decided,
(590,8)ing mischief, on the(1529,13)whale (many(688,9)
(97,12)I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am
correct in my opinion.”

Here are his reflections some time after quitt(1410,9)hip, during a
black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
hospitable shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the
fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon
hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the
dismal looking wreck, and _the horrid(997,8)and(804,9)(587,12)_,
wholly engrossed my(486,12), until day again made its appearance.”

In another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “_the mysterious and mort(1470,9)
of the animal_.”

Secondly: The ship Union, also(1950,13), was in the year 1807
totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic
particulars of this(1844,12)(1939,8)never chanced to encounter,
though(1313,10)whale hunters(65,9)ow(1570,8)n heard casual
allusions to it.

Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then
commanding an American sloop-of-war(1677,8)first class, happened to be
dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a(432,10) ship in
the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,
the(237,11)was pleas(174,8) sceptical touch(1915,8)amazing strength
ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily
denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout
(394,13)as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very
good;(719,8)re is more coming. Some weeks after, (321,14)set
sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on
the way by a portly sperm wha(277,9)begged a few moments’
confidential business with him. That(24,10)consisted in fet(485,9)
(773,9)’s craft such a thwack, that(1483,10)his pumps going he made
straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not
superstitious, but I consider(385,14)’s interview with that whale
as prov(283,8). Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a
(1274,8)fright? I tell you, the(421,12) will stand no nonsense.

I will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance
in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof.(102,11), you
must know(949,8)way, was attach(982,9) Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s
famous Discovery Expedition(1635,8)beginning(1878,8)present century.
Captain(267,11) thus begins his seventeenth chapter:

“By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail,(1596,8) next day
we were out(1816,8)open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was
very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that (118,9)bliged to
keep(113,8)fur clothing. For some days we had very(549,8)wind; it was
not till the nineteen(793,8)a brisk gale(1898,10)northwest sprang up.
An uncommon large(1162,10)e body of which was larger than the ship
itself, lay almost at the surface(1857,8)water, but was not perceived
by any one(1828,10)(226,9)moment whe(120,10),(152,11)in full
sail, was(137,8)upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its
striking against him. We were thus placed(767,8)most imminent danger,
as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised(342,9) three
feet at least out(332,13). The masts reeled(764,10)sails fell
altogether, while we who were below all(536,8)instantly upon the deck,
concluding(736,9)had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw
the monster sailing off(1496,8)e utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain
D’Wolf applied immediately(1312,8)pumps to examine whether or not the
vessel had received any damag(828,11)shock, but we found that very
happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”

Now, the(202,8) D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding(535,10)in
question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual
adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides(1508,8)village of
Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I
have particularly (215,8)ed him concerning this passage (1606,13).
He substantiates every word. T(1067,9)however, was by no means a large
one: a(1804,9)craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my
uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.

In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned (464,9), so full,
too, of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
Dampier’s old chums—I found a(1684,8)matter set down so like that just
quot(224,8)(2046,10), that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a
corroborative example, if such be needed.

Lionel, it seems, was on his(2020,8)“John Ferdinando,” as he calls the
modern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four
o’clock(1574,10)rning, when we were about one hundred and fifty
leagues(1986,10)Main of America, our ship felt a terribl(1200,9)which
put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where
they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death.
And, indeed,(1368,10) was so sudden and violent,(1640,9)took it for
grant(1835,12)(1669,11)(1972,8)a rock; but when the amazement was
(709,9)over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * *
* * * The suddenness(1957,8)shock made the guns leap in their
carriages, and several(2021,8)men were shaken(2048,11)ir hammocks.

cabin!”(1045,8)then goes on to impute(437,11)to an earthquake, and
seems to(1429,13) the imputation by stating that a great
(77,12)somewh(803,10)that time, did actually do great mischief
along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the
dark(453,10)at early hour(408,9)(972,8)(708,14)after all
caused by an unseen whale vertically bump(2012,8)hull from beneath.

I might proceed with(546,9)mor(1289,9)s, one way or another known to
me,(657,8)great power and malice at time(696,10)perm whale. In more
than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
boats back to their ships, but to pursu(618,8)ip itself, and long
withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship
Pusie Hall can tell a story (1301,8)head; and, as for his strength, let
me say,(1350,9)re have been(419,9) where the lines attached to a
running(378,12) have, in a calm, been transferred to(1285,9)(895,8)cured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a
horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if
(587,15), once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,
not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of
destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent
indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will
frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for
(1570,8)consecutive minutes(1251,8)must be content with only one more
and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,
by which you will not fail to see, that(1044,10)is the most marvellous
event in this book corroborated by plain fact(1885,9)present day, but
(896,8)se marvels (like all(18,8)) are mere repetition(1968,9)ages;
so that for the millionth time we say am(655,8)Solomon—Verily there is
nothing new under the sun.

In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a(37,11)magistrate
of Constantinople(1734,8) days when Justinian was Emperor and
Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history(763,8)own
times, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he
has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating
historian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting
the matter(606,8)ly to be mentioned.

Now,(687,9)(278,14),(437,10)(51,8)s that, dur(2030,8)term
of his prefecture at(462,17)a great sea-monster was captured
in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed
vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty
years. A fact thus set down in substantial(589,9)cannot easily be
gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species
this(311,16), is not(462,11) But as he(269,10) ships, as
well(2042,8)other reasons, he must(2028,11)a whale; and I am strongly
inclin(1971,8)ink a(2028,12). And I will tell you why. For a long
time I fancied (1264,8)(1892,12) had been(848,8)unknown in the
Mediterranean and the deep(484,8)connecting with it. Even now I am
certa(1700,8)those seas are not, and perhaps never can b(1181,9)
(1467,8)constitu(1874,8)things, a place for his habitual gregarious
resort. But further investigations have recently proved to m(1689,8)in
modern time(619,8)(465,10)isolated instance(1661,15)ce of the
(387,12)in the (363,13). I am told, on good(1287,9)y, that on
the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davi(1793,9)British navy found the
skeleton of(613,16)Now, as a vessel of war readily passes
through the Dardanelles, hence(698,14) could, by the same route,
pass out(1969,8)(636,14)into the(1199,10)(1815,10)(1218,11)as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar
substance called _brit_ is to be found, the alimen(157,9)right whale.
But I have ever(1146,9)to believe(893,10)food(534,8)sperm
whale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom(198,9)sea, because
large creatures, but by no means the largest(66,10)ort,(1168,10)
found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements
together, and(1408,8)upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,
according to all human reasoning(1845,11)’(1460,13), that for
half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all
probability(1457,13)(1412,12)


CHAPTER 46. Surmises.

Though, consumed with the hot fire (1998,8)urpose, Ahab in all his
thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate(2020,8) of Moby
Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that
one passion; nevertheless it ma(288,12)that he was by nature and
long(1431,8)tion far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, al(599,8)
to abandon the collateral prosec(1562,11)e voyage. Or at least if
this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more
influential with him. It would be refining too much,(1763,8), even
considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all(1679,12)s, and(1200,10)more monsters he slew by so much(37,10)he
multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would
prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be
indeed exceptionabl(485,14)still additional (399,8)ations which,
though not so strictly (1185,10)(985,9)wildness(985,8)ruling
passion, yet were(1429,13)incapable of swaying him.

To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in
the shadow(1878,8)moon, men are most apt to get(1919,8)order. He knew,
for example, that however magnetic his ascendency(616,9)respects was
over Starbuck, yet that(56,12)did not cover the complete spiritual
man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual
mastership; for to the purely(107,10), the(58,13) but stand in
a sort of(125,11)relation.(235,9)’s body and(20,12)coerced
will were Ahab’s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at(92,13)rain;
still he knew(1802,9) all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred
his captain’s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself
from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would
elapse ere the (1261,12)was seen. During that(69,15)(619,8)
would ever be(752,8)fall into open relapses of rebellion against his
(279,10)leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial(1597,8)ces were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle
insanity of Ahab(876,8)ing Moby Dick was noways more significantly
manifested than(532,9)uperlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing
that, for the present, the hunt should(1660,9)way be stripped of that
strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it;(1713,9)
full terror(1268,8)voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
background (for few men’s courage is proof(543,9)protracted
meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night
watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of
than(527,10). For(1469,9)eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had
hailed the announcement(1776,8)quest; yet all sailors(1685,8)sorts are
more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer
weather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any
object remote and blank(111,8)pursuit,(1768,9)promissory of life and(2016,8)(166,8)end, it is above(1405,8)ngs requisite that temporary
interests and employments(824,10)tervene and hold them healthily
suspended(901,9)final dash.

Nor w(1612,8)unmindful of anoth(569,8). In times of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
The permanent constitutional condition(954,8)manufactured man, thought
Ahab, is sordidness. Grant(1549,9)(1587,16)fully incites the
hearts of this my(759,12), and playing roun(934,8)savageness even
breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for
the love of it they give chase to(1493,10), they must also have food
for their more common, daily appetites. F(1944,8)the high lifted and
chivalric Crusaders of old tim(1720,8)not content to traverse two
thousand miles of land to fight(1580,8)ir holy sepulchre, without
committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious
perquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final
and romantic object—that final (31,19), too many would have
turned from in disgust. I will not strip these me(747,10) Ahab, of
all hopes of cash—aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some
months go by, and no perspective promis(646,9)o them(1385,9)n this
same quiescent cash all at once mutinying(752,10)this same cash would
soon cashier Ahab(1197,11)there wanting still(1199,9)precautionary motive more related
to Ahab personally. Having impulsively(1453,8)probable, and perhaps
somewhat prematurely revea(1802,8)prime but private purpose of the
Pequod’s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he
had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From
(1209,9)barely hinted imputa(1599,8)(245,10)(702,9) possible
consequences of such a suppressed impression(1119,9)ground, Ahab must
of course have been most anxious to protect(432,8). That(22,8)ion
could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,
backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute
atmospheric influence which it was(321,9) for(538,9) to be
subjected to.

For all these reasons then, and others(877,8) too analytic to be
verbally developed her(837,8)plainly saw that he must still in a good
degree continue true(817,8)natural, nominal(960,15) (960,8)
voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force
(945,8)to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general
pursuit of his profession.

Be all this as it may, his voice(1147,9)often heard hailing the three
mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out(1619,8)t omit
reporting even a porpoise. This vigilan(152,9)t long without reward.


CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.

It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.
Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,
for an additional lashing to our boat. So(1816,9)d subdued and yet
somehow preluding was(914,8) scene, and such an incan(1344,10)reverie
lurked(645,8)air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into(1225,8)
invisible self.

I(2023,8) attendant or page of (332,8), while busy at the mat. As I
kept passing and re(14,8)the filling or woof of marline between the
long yarns(1017,8)warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as(506,9), standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
(148,11) threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly
and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess
did there then reign all ove(259,8)ip and(22,15)ea, only
broken by the intermitting dull sound(1385,8)sword, that it(586,8)as
if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a(412,8) mechanically
(887,8)an(899,10)awa(595,9)Fates. There lay the fixed(394,8) of
(539,8) subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging
vibration, and that (20,9) merely enough to admit(1675,8)crosswise
interblending of other(167,9)with its own. This warp seemed
necessity; an(1874,8)thought I, with(755,13)I ply(773,8)shuttle
(327,8)e(798,8)destiny(1314,9)se unalterabl(718,9). Meantime,(1325,9)’s impulsive, indifferent(533,8)sometimes hitt(1706,8)woof
slantingly, or crookedly, or stro(27,9)weakly, as the case might be;
and by this (128,8)ce(1914,8)concluding blow producing a corresponding
contra(1972,10)final aspec(457,10)ompleted fabric; this savage’s
(779,9)(403,10)hich thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and
woof; this easy(346,19) must be chance—aye, chance, free
will, and (566,9)—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working
together. The straight warp of(88,10), not to be swerved from its
ultimate course—its every alternating(842,10), indeed, only tending
to that; free will still free to ply her(1089,9)(1571,8)given(1425,8);
and(295,9)though restrained in its play within the right lines of(902,10), and(1580,9)(62,8)motions directed by(182,10)(943,8)
thus prescribed to by both(456,8) by turns rules either, and has the
last featur(738,9)at events.

Thus we were(1339,10)(1351,16)when I started at a sound so
strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of
(441,10)dropp(547,8)my hand(1550,8)stood gazing up(1506,8)clouds
whence that voice(76,9)like a wing. High alof(972,9)cross-trees
was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly
forward, his hand stretched out(140,9)(215,9)at brief sudden
intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound (190,8)
very moment perhaps being hear(2010,18)s, from hundreds of
whalemen’s look-outs perched as high(1353,8)air; but from few of those
lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous
cadence as from(396,9) the Indian’s.

As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have(1892,9)him some
prophet or seer behold(1760,8)shadows of Fate, (1700,9)ose wild cries
announcing their coming.

“There she blows! there! there(14,9)(32,11)(43,10)”

“Where-away?”

“On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”

Instantly all was commotion.

The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with(715,10)undeviating and
reliable uniformity. And thereby (681,8) distinguish this fish from
other tribes of his genus(334,10)go flukes!” was now the cry(631,14); and the whales
disappeared.

“Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”

Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced(1252,8)watch, and reported the exact
minute to Ahab.

The ship(201,9)kept away from the wi(1370,8)she went gently rolling
before it.(883,10)reporting(1477,10)whales had gone down heading to
leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by t(645,14)
when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
concealed benea(704,8)urface, mills rou(355,9)wiftly swims off in
the opposite quarter—this deceitfulnes(688,9)could not now be in
action; for there was no reason to suppose(1909,10)fish seen by
(1356,9)had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our
vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not
appointed to the boats, by this time relieved(1529,11) at the
main-mast head. The sailors(836,8)fore and mizzen had come down; the
line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out;(140,9)yard was backed,(1076,9)three boats swu(1698,8)the sea like three
samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outsid(373,9)bulwarks their eager
crews with one hand clung(362,8)rail, while one foot was expectantly
poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about
to throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.

But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
every eye(1277,11)hale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was
surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.


CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.

The(85,9), for so they then seemed, were flitting(412,8)other side
of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the
tackles and bands(621,9)oat which swung there. This boat had always
been deemed o(1062,10)spar(1003,9)though technically called the
captain’s, on account of its hanging(1757,10)starboard(1368,8). The
figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart,(828,10)white
tooth evilly protrud(125,9)its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese
jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black
trowser(397,9)same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness
was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and
coiled round an(10,8)upon(1879,9). Less swart in aspect, the
companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion
peculiar to som(1670,9)aboriginal native(702,9)Manillas;—a race
notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white
mariners(1912,8)d to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents
on the water(1875,8)devil, their lord, whose counting-room they(2037,8)
to be elsewhere.

While yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these
strangers, Ahab cried out(1975,8)white-turbaned old m(1958,9)ir head,
“All ready there, Fedallah?”

“Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.

“Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across(1287,9). (56,11)
there, I say.”

Such(117,9)thunder of his voice, that spit(1909,8)ir amazement the
men spra(2010,12)rail; the sheaves whir(825,10)in the blocks; with
a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while(1506,8)
dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the
sailors, goat-like, leaped down the roll(572,11)side(149,10)tossed
boats below.

Hardly had they pulled out from under the(656,8)lee, when a fourth
keel, com(1522,13)windward side,(89,8)round(86,12)tern, and
showed the five(1326,8)rs rowing(2045,10), standing erect in the
stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves
widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their
eyes again riveted(949,9) swart(864,9) and his crew, the inmates of
the other boats obeyed not the command.

“Captain Ahab?—” sai(252,10).

“Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou,
Flask, pull out more to leeward!”

“Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his
great steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing(312,9).
“There!—there!—there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay
back!”

“Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”

“Oh, I don’t mind ’em(250,8)said Archy; “I knew it all before now.
Didn’t I hear ’em(1147,8)hold? And d(35,8)tell Cabaco here of it?
What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”

“Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive;(28,10)children(19,11)little
ones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to(747,11)some of whom
still showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones,
my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in(481,8)boat? Tut! They
are only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the more
the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; (65,11)the brimstone—devils are
good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for a
thousand pounds(41,20)to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the
gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts alive!
Easy, easy; don’t be in a hurry—(20,19). (516,14)snap
your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,
then:—softly, softly! That’s it—t(10,8)! long and strong. Give way
there, (1345,8)! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are
all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull(594,8)will ye? pull,
can’t(16,10) wo(16,8)Why(1119,8)name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes
don’t ye pull?—pull and break(345,10)! pull, and start your eyes out!
Here!” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; “every mother’s
son of ye draw his knife(269,10) with the blade between his teeth.
(470,19). Now ye do(556,10); that looks like it, my
steel-bits. Start her—s(10,8), my silver-spoons!(39,10),
marling-spikes!”

Stubb’s exordium(1312,12) is given here at large, because he had
rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this
specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief
(271,8)ity. He would say the most terrific things(1694,14)in a
tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury,(147,8) fury seemed so
calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear
such queer invocations without pulling for dear l(796,9)ye(31,9)
for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy
and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so
broadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—that(177,10)sight of such a
yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon
the crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,
whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all
inferiors on their guard(1455,8)matter of obeying them.

In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now(557,9)obliquely
across (1167,8)bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
pretty near to each other(331,8)hailed(205,8)e.

“Mr.(158,9)! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
please!”

“Halloa!” returned(251,9), turning round not a single inch as he
spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging(1451,9); his face set
like a flint from(345,8).

“What think y(600,11)yellow boys, sir!”

“Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
boys!)” in a(198,8)(1258,14)then speak(1951,8)loud again: “A sad
business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, (12,12)my lads!) but never mind,
(62,9), all (1170,8)best. Let all your crew pull(203,8) come what
will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.
(136,8)nd that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’s the
play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”

“Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized(313,8)when the boats
diverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em(97,12)so. Aye(253,12)
what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at the bottom
of it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men!
It ain’t t(113,14) to-day(48,10)!”

Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
as the lowering(1891,8)boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
awakened a(1648,9)superstitious amazement in som(1996,9)ship’s
company; but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got
abroad among them, though indeed not credited then(212,11)in some
small measure prepared them(1024,9)event. It took off the extreme edge
of their wonder; and so what with all this and(1742,9)confident way of
accounting(1151,8)ir appearance, t(700,9)(1183,8)time freed from
(395,14)surmisings;(287,8)the affair still left abundant room
for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in
the matter(606,10)beginning. For me, I silently recalled the
mysterious shadows I had seen creeping(1667,9) the Pequod during the
dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the
unaccountable Elijah.

Meantime, Ahab, out of hea(858,8)his officers,(717,9)ided the
furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead(938,8)other boats; a
circumstance be(1833,9)how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger
yellow creatures(190,8)seemed all steel and whalebone; like five
trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which
periodically started(1615,9) along the water like a horizontal burst
boiler(403,8)a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen
(300,8)the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and
displayed his naked chest with the whole part(564,8)body above the
gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depression(704,8) watery
horizon; while(1749,8)other en(609,9)boat Ahab, with one arm, like a
fencer’s,(255,8)half backward(1947,11)ir, as if to counterbalance
any tendency to trip; Ahab(385,9) steadily managing his steering oar
as in a thousand boat(1757,9)s ere(1886,17)had torn him. All
at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained
fixed, while(1876,9)’s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat
and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats(1402,8)rear paused on(1697,8)ay. The whales had irregularly settled bodily
down(470,10)blue, thus giving no di(143,8)discernible token(1348,8)movement(1955,9)from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.

“Every man look ou(1038,8)his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,
stand up!”

Nimbly springing up(357,8)triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
spot wh(691,8)chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme
ster(374,8) boa(84,8)it was also(223,11)ly platformed level with
the (1144,9)(337,8) himself(932,10)coolly and adroitly balancing
(47,8)to the jerking toss(1888,8)his chip of a craft, and silently
eye(1415,8)vast blue eye(1809,8)sea.

Not very far(656,8) Flask’s boa(254,11)lying breathlessly still;
its commander reck(32,9)anding(367,10)top(1938,8)loggerhead, a
stout sort of post rooted(575,8)keel, and rising some two feet above
the level(230,9)tern(428,9). It is used for catching turns(1628,9)
whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand,
and(261,15)such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the
mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little
King-Post was small and short, an(114,8) same time little (59,9)
was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this(488,11)
stand-poin(1972,9)did by no means satisfy(116,10).

“I can’t se(1462,9)eas off; tip us up an oar(1100,12)let me on to
that.”

Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand(1055,10)gunwale to steady his way,
swiftly slid (896,9)then erecting(1017,9)volunteered his lofty
shoulders for a pedestal.

“Good a (510,10)as any, sir. Will you mount?”

“That I will(138,8)ank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
fifty feet taller.”

Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks(1738,8)boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
(1181,8)foo(371,12)putting(1212,9)hand on his hearse-plumed head
and bidding him spring as he(1455,9)should toss, with one dexterous
fling landed th(816,9)man high and dry(136,8)(496,9). And here was
Flask now(1329,9)(667,8)(118,10)lifted arm furnish(187,8)with a
breastband to lean(406,9)and(702,10)mself by.

At any time it is a strange sight(1666,8)tyro to see with what wondrous
habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously
perverse and cross-running seas. Still more(229,9)to see him giddily
(1406,8)(1714,9)(1703,10) itself, under such circumstances. But the
sight of(1346,8)Flask mount(92,8)(774,9)(490,8)as yet more
curious; for sustain(1104,12)with a cool, indifferent, easy,
unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every rol(1852,8)
sea harmoniously roll(915,8)ine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired
(1758,13)a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler(1880,10)rider.
Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious(377,14)would now
(1443,9)stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby
give(797,8)negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity
stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her
tides and her seasons for that.

Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing
solicitudes. T(970,8)s might have made one of their regular soundings,
not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,
Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the
languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,
where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed
home the loading(137,10)thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his
match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his
harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed
stars, suddenly dropped like ligh(324,11)erect attitude to his seat,
crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down all, and give
way!—there they are!”

To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over(567,8)
suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
rolling billows. The air around(456,10)vibrated and tingled, as it
were(109,11)air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this
atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of(342,9)lso, t(1189,10)were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
indications, the(405,16)they spouted,(1745,8)their forerunning
couriers and detached fl(733,8)riders.

All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of(617,9)
water and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as
a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
hills.

“Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
intensest concentrated whisper(1082,8)men; while the sharp fixed glance
(1147,10)yes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost(479,8)as two(1022,9)needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He(1967,9)say much
to his crew, though, nor did(26,9) say anything to him. Only the
silenc(1904,8) boat was at(1746,9)s startlingly pierced by(1960,8)his
peculiar(338,8)s, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.

How different the loud little King-Post. “S(1498,8)and say something,
my hearties. Roar and(575,10)thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on
their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you
my Martha’s Vineyard plantation(86,8)including wife and children,
boys. Lay me on—l(10,8)! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring
mad! See! see that white water!” And so shouting, he pulled his hat(764,10)head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up,
flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and
plunging(1003,8)boat’s stern like a crazed colt(1102,9) prairie.

“Look(1913,9)chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a
short distance, followed after—“He’s got fits, that Flask has. Fits?
yes, give him fits—that’s the very word—pitch fits into ’em. Merrily,
merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;—merry’s the word.
Pull, babes—pull, suckling(16,8)all. But what the devil are you
hurrying about? Softly, softly(629,8)eadily, my men. Only pull, and
keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your
kniv(1435,9)(339,8)all. Take it easy—why don’t ye t(26,11), I
say, and burst(117,10)liv(2002,8)lungs!”

(276,9)it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
his—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed
light(1738,8)evangelical land(1599,10) infidel sharks(1922,8)audacious
seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of
red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leap(830,8) his prey.

Meanwhile, all(1767,9)s tore on. The repeated specific allusions of
Flask to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he
declared to be incessantly tantalizing his(1241,8)bow with its
tail—these(155,13) his were at times so vivid and life-like, that
they would cause some one or two(83,8)men to snatch a fearful look
over the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must
put out their ey(904,8)ram a skewer through their necks; usage
pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but
arms, in these critical moments.

It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the
omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled
along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless
bowling-green; the brief suspended agony(1013,8)boat, as it would tip
for an instant on the kn(612,8) edge(1080,8)sharper wave(1729,8)almost
seemed threatening to cut it in two(291,8)dden profound dip into the
watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the
top(1258,8)opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other
side;—all these(1237,8)he crie(520,8) headsmen and harpooneers, and
the shuddering gasp(58,9)oarsm(1326,10)he wondrous s(1455,11)
ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like
a wild hen(1363,8)er screaming brood(240,8)is was thrilling.

Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom(1222,9)ife(478,9) fever
heat(1254,8)first battle; not the dead man’s ghost encountering the
first unknown phantom(1709,8)other world;—neither of(1038,8)an feel
stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who(1271,9)first
time finds himself pulling(247,10)charmed, churned circl(853,8)
hunted sperm whale.

The dancing white water made by(88,8)se was now becoming more and
more visible, owing to the increasing darknes(719,9)dun cloud-shadows
flung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted
everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.
T(2028,9)were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to thre(103,8)
running dead to leeward. Our sail(344,9)set, and(1023,11)still
rising wind, we rushed along;(1394,9) going with such madness(1797,8)
the water,(1777,9) lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to
escape being torn(915,10)row-locks.

Soon we were (262,8)(1937,8)a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither
ship nor boat to be seen.

“Give way, men,” whispered(409,9), drawing still further aft the
shee(1057,9)sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall
comes. There’s(837,13)again!—close to! Spring!”

Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
(456,9)ot(1436,10)had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when
with a lightning-like hurtling(347,8)(754,10)said: “Stand up!” and
Queequeg,(1693,8) in hand, sprang to his feet.

Though not on(2043,9)oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril
so (353,8) them ahead, yet(1865,9)ir eyes on the intense countenance
of the mate(1504,8)stern(2017,8)boat, they knew(836,10)imminent
instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of
fifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile(1027,10)was still
boom(881,12)the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like
the erected crests of enraged serpents.

“That’s his hump. _There_, _there_, give it to him!(947,11)
(1356,8).

A short rush(285,10)leaped out(400,12); it(553,8) darted iron of(654,9). Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
astern, while forward(1397,10)(1606,8)triking on a ledge; the sail
collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;
something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole
crew were half suffocated as the(1059,8)ossed helter-skelter into the
white curdling cream(2004,8)squall. Squall, whale, and(1044,9)had all
blended together; and(1953,10), merely grazed by the iron, escaped(1092,10)completely swamped,(790,14)nearly unharmed. Swimming round
it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
(404,8)back to our plac(1570,9) we sat up(31,8)knees(1139,9)ea,(1962,10) covering every rib and plank, so that(104,8)downward gazing
eyes the suspended craf(693,9)a coral boat grown up to us(2003,9)
botto(480,9)ocean.

The wind increased to a howl;(1123,11)dashed their bucklers(499,10)
t(668,8) squall roared, forked, and crackled(1181,15) a white
fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal
in these jaws of death! In vain we hailed(1906,16); as well roar
to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those
boats in that storm(1523,16)driving scud, rack, and mist, grew
darker(1799,9) shadows of night; no sig(1766,9)ship could be seen.
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out(1838,9). The oars were
useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.
So, cutting the(914,9)of (823,9)proof match keg, after many
failures (1651,8) contrived to ignite the lamp(919,8)lantern; then
stretching it on a waif pole, handed it to (1670,8) as the
standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up
that imbecile candle(1090,8)heart of that almighty(97,8)nes(1162,8),
(96,14)the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly
(151,10) hop(135,9)midst of despair.

Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold,(53,8)ing of ship or boat,
we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over
(1389,8) the empty(485,8) lay crushed(1431,8)(1286,14)boat.
Suddenly(484,10)started to his feet, hollowing his han(32,9)ear.
We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled
by the(1063,8)The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were
dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the
sea(398,8)ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us
within a distance of not much more than its length.

F(1969,9)n(1668,11)we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
tossed and gaped benea(1346,9)ip’s bow(1670,9)chip at the base of a
cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no
more till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were
dashed against it (555,8)eas, and were(421,9)taken up and safely
landed on board. Ere th(1972,9)came close to,(1822,16) had cut
loose from their fish and returned to(1669,10)in good time. The ship
had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon
some token of our perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.


CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.

There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed
affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast
practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more
than suspects that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own.
However, nothing dispirits, and(23,9)seems worth while disputing. He
bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all
hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich
of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for
small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril
of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,
good-natured h(411,9)jolly punches(1994,8)side bestowed(1087,8)unseen
and unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am
speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation;
it com(180,10)very midst of(1901,8)nestness, so that what just before
might have seem(1996,8)m a thing most momentous, now seems but a part
of the general joke. There is(791,9)like the perils of whaling to
breed this free and easy(333,9)genial, desperado philosophy; and with
it I now regard(84,8)whole voyage of the Pequod,(1712,8) great White
Whale its object.

“Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the
deck, and I(1476,11)shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the
water; (141,10) my fine friend, do(1339,8)(648,8)thing often
happen?” Without much emotion(1348,9)soaked through just like me, he
gave me to understand that such(1154,8)did often happen.

“Mr. Stubb(327,11)turning t(680,8)orthy, who, buttoned up in his
oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe(982,8)rain; (126,11) I
think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
squall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”

“Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off
Cape Horn.”

“Mr. Flask(485,22)little King-Post, who was standing
close by; “you are experienced in these things(853,8)am not. Will you
tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, (195,10)
for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into
death’s jaws?”

“Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I
should like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to(524,8) face
(164,8). Ha, ha! the(619,8)ould give them squint for squint, mind
that!”

Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statemen(1618,9)entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings
in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of
common occurrence(555,9)kind of life; c(159,10) that at the
superlatively critical instant of going on to(379,11)I must resign
my life into the hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow
who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of
scuttling the craft with(781,9)frantic stampings(283,18)
the particular disaster to our own(31,12)boat was chiefly to be
imputed to(1399,9)’s driv(335,10)his whale almost(1550,8)teeth of a
squall,(542,9)(452,13)(1488,10)notwith(1184,8), was famous for
his great heedfulness(1661,8)fishery(549,19)I belonged to
this uncommonly(1574,8)(224,12)boat; and finally(633,13)in
what a devil’s chase I was implicated, touch(455,8)White Whale: taking
all(1991,8)together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make
a rough draft of my will. “Queequeg(1573,11)“come along, you shall be
my lawyer, executor, and legatee.”

It may seem strange(1994,13)men sailors should be tinkering at
their last wi(1106,8)testaments, but there are no people(602,8)world
more fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical
life(550,8)had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded
(963,10)resent occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled
away from my heart. Besides,(64,9)days I(345,8)now liv(1604,8)be as
good as(47,10)that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a
supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks(109,8)case might
be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.
I looked round me tranquilly(1643,8)tentedly, like a quiet ghost with a
clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.

Now then,(918,10), unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
here goes for a cool, collected dive at(294,11)destruction, and the
devil fetch the hindmost.


CHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.

“Who would have(1139,9)it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg
you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole
with my timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”

“I don’t think it so(1174,8), after all, on that account(1294,8)Flask.
“If his leg were off at the hip, now, it(872,11) different thing.
Tha(33,8)disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other
left, you know.(230,12)know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”

Among whale-wise(1359,9)t has often been argued whether,(1965,12)
the paramount importance of his life to the success(217,8)voyage, it
is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that lif(1530,9)active
peril(94,9)chase. So Tamerlane’s soldier(223,8)(218,8)ith tears in
their eyes,(244,8) that invaluable lif(227,9)ought to be carried
into the thickes(462,9)fight.

But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. C(378,10) that
with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
(461,11) that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed
man to ente(586,8)e-boat(557,8)hunt? As a general thing, the
joint-owner(680,9)Pequod must have plainly(1525,9)not.

Ahab well knew that although his friends at hom(1951,8)think(950,8)of
his entering a (187,8)certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
(770,9), for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving
his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have(177,8)actually
apportioned to him as a regular headsman(414,12)—above all for
(104,16)be suppli(953,8)five extra men, as that same boat’s
crew, he(417,16)such generous conceits never entered the heads
(1427,8)(544,19). Therefore he had not solicited a(140,12) from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires(1711,9)head.
Nevertheless(114,8)taken private measures(1193,9)wn touching all that
matter. Until Cabaco’s published discovery, the sailors had little
foreseen it, though(426,9)re when(1912,8)being a(1703,8)while out of
port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the
whaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then
found bestirring himself(1652,8)matter of making thole-pins with his
own hands for what was(1080,9)to be one(2027,8)spare boats, and even
solicitously cu(236,9) small wooden skewers, which when the line is
running out are pinned over the groov(1875,9)bow: when all this was
observed in him, and particularly his(756,8)ude in having an extra
coat of sheathing(116,10)ttom(1984,8)boat, as if to make it better
withstand the pointed pressur(1946,9)ivory limb; and also the anxiety
he evinced in exactly shap(356,8)thigh board, or clumsy cle(159,8)t
is sometimes called, the horizontal piec(350,11)at’s bow for bracing
the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whal(730,8)it(416,14)how often he stood up in that boat(678,9) solitary knee
fixed(1837,8)semi-circular depressio(1455,9)(263,8)nd with the
carpenter’s chisel gouged out(1018,10)here and straightened it a
little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and
curiosity(304,8)time. But almost everybody supposed that this
(726,10) pre(1908,8) heedfulness (1789,8)must only be with a view to
the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for(1584,8)already revealed his
intention to hunt that mortal monster(1952,10). But such a supposition
did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any(685,8)crew
being assigned to(592,10).

Now,(520,9) subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
away; for in a whaler wonders(41,10). Besides,(1463,13) such
unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up(1939,9) unknown
nooks and ash-hole(2036,9)earth to man these floating outlaws of
whalers;(1624,8) ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway
creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,
oars, (1821,10), canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that
Beelzebub(1807,9)might climb up the sid(986,8)ep down into the cabin
to ch(1155,8)the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable
excitement(1937,8)forecastle.

But be(1724,10)as it may, certain it is that while(692,16)
(692,8) soon(380,8)heir place among the crew, though still as it were
somehow distinct(616,9)m, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah(802,10)a
muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like
this, by what sort of (816,14)tie he soon(1821,9)(494,8)to be
linked with Ahab’s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort
of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even
authority over him(1587,8)is none knew. But one cannot sustain an
indifferent air concerning(393,9). He was(1369,8)(916,8) as
civilized, domestic peopl(2031,9)temperate zone only se(31,8)ir
dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom(1268,14)glide
(655,10)unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles
to the east(1261,8)continent—those insulated, immemorial, unalterable
countries, which even i(1324,8)modern days still preserve much of the
ghostly aboriginalness of earth’s primal generations, when the memory
of the first man was a(912,10)recollection, and all men his
descendants, unknowing w(882,13), eyed each other as real(1094,9), and asked(1604,8)sun(1560,9)moon why they were created and
to what end;(224,8)ough, according to Genesis, the angels indeed
consort(951,8)the daughters of men, the devils also, add the
uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.


CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.

Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly
swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off
the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being(72,9)mouth of
the Rio de la Plata(2037,10)Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery
locality, southerly from St. Helena.

It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;
and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery
silence, not a solitude; on(1385,8)silent night(58,10) jet was seen
far in advance(1205,8)white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by(890,9), it
looked celestial;(177,8)some plumed and glittering god uprising from
the sea.(1988,10)first descried this jet. For of(1298,9)onlight
nights, it was his wont to mount(2042,8)main-mast head, and stand a
look-out there,(1012,10)same precision as if it had been day. And yet,
though herds of whales were seen by(582,8)not one whaleman in a
hundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what
emotions, th(1189,8)seamen beheld this old(1739,10)perched aloft at
such unusual hours; his turba(1415,14), companions in one sky. But
when, after spending his uniform interval there fo(1172,10)successive
nights without u(592,8)a single sou(1515,8)(111,8)all this (823,8)
his unearthly voice was heard announcing that(886,8), moon-lit jet,
every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit
had lighted in the rigging, and haile(1770,8)rtal crew. “There she
blows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered
more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was
a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
(810,8).

Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
t’gallant sails and royals to be set, and(167,8)tunsail spread. The
best man(494,8)ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head
manned, the piled-up craft(1664,8)down before the wind. The strange,
upheaving, lifting tendency(1546,8)taffrail breeze fill(327,8)hollows
of so many sail(1720,8)the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air
beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic
influenc(1383,9)truggling in her—one(1549,10)direct to heaven, the
other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched
Ahab’s face that(1514,8)you would have thought that in him also two
different things were warring. While his one live leg made lively
echoes alo(762,11),(668,9)roke of his dead limb sounded like a
coffin-tap. On life and death(1599,10)man walked. But(1043,8)(736,8)
so swiftly sped, and(1080,8)from every eye, like arrows, the eager
glances shot, yet the(1435,8) jet was no mo(1891,8)(379,10). Every
sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.

This midnight-spout had(1171,8)grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again(1672,8)ed: again it
was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after
night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted
into the clear moonlight, or starlight, (1584,8)ase might be;(201,10)ing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and
somehow seeming a(1637,8)distinct repetition to be advancing still
further and (12,8)in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever
alluring us on.

Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance
(66,9)preternaturalness, as i(137,8), which in many(1138,8)invested
the Pequod, were there wanting some(1587,8)seamen who swore that
whenever and wherever(712,9); at however remote times, or in(28,8)
far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by
one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there
reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as
if it were treacherously beckon(529,9) and on, in order that the
monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest
and most savage seas.

These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a
wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity(579,8)weather, in
which, beneath all its blue blandness, som(1871,12)ere lurked a
devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so
wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful
errand,(1027,8)vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.

But,(458,8), when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began
howling around(549,9)we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas
that a(1036,8); when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the
blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of
silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this
desolate vacuity(390,9)went away, but gave place to sights more
dismal than before.

Clos(513,9)bows, strange forms(903,8)water darted hi(1612,9)thither
before us; while thick(1635,8)rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and
spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clu(671,10)hemp,
as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a
thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for
their homeless selves. And heaved a(11,9), still unrestingly heaved
the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscienc(1655,9)e great
mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for(921,9) sin and suffering
it had bred.

Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called
of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that(1227,8)had
attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where
guilty beings transform(57,10)ose fowls(517,8)se fish(1400,8)
condemned to swim on everla(474,8)without any haven in store, or beat
that black air(51,14)orizon. But calm, snow-white, and
unvarying; still direc(1551,8) fountain of feathers(1507,8)sky; still
beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be
descried.

During(1305,9) blacknes(1042,8) elements, Ahab,(962,8)assuming(850,8) time the almost continual command(2029,8)drenched and dangerous
deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever
addressed his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything
above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but
passively to await the issue(340,8)gale. Then Captain and crew become
practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg insert(836,8)its
accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for
hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an
occasional squall of sleet or snow(666,8)ll but congeal his very
eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of
the ship(1207,11)ilous sea(1201,8)ur(1502,8)broke over its bows,
stood in a line along the bulwark(2010,11)ist(1510,10)better to
guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
sort of bowline(659,8)(1895,8)rail, in which he swung as in a loosened
belt. Few or no wo(2037,10)poken(1704,10)silent ship(1765,8)manned by
painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift
madness and glad(1149,12)demoniac waves. By night the same muteness
of humanity(1664,8)the shriek(1230,9)ocean prevailed(1414,8)in(1730,8)
the men swung(470,8)bowlines(1462,8)wordless Ahab stood up to the
blast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not
seek that(30,8)in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old
man’s aspect, when one night going down(1917,8)e cabin to mark how the
barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his
floor-screwed chair;(694,8)n and half-melted(1065,8)f the storm from
(730,9)had some time(498,8)emerged, still slowly dripping(1059,9)
unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of
those charts of tides and currents(903,8)ave previously been spoken
of. His lanter(630,8)from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body
was erect, the head was thrown back so that the(431,13)were
pointed towards the needl(1715,9)tell-tale that(168,12)a beam in
the ceiling.*

*T(593,8)-compass is called(84,14), because withou(668,8)to
the (62,8)at the helm, the(1853,8)(1653,8)below, can inform(1343,8)
of the cours(1926,9)ship.

Terrible old man! thought(854,10)with a shudder, sleepi(1055,8)is
gale(629,8)thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.


CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.

South-eastward(1753,10)Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising
ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney ((143,9))
by name. As she(853,10)ew nigh, from my lofty perch at the
fore-mast-head, I had(169,8)view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
in the far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.

As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her side(84,8)spectral
appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust(744,8)all
her spars and her rigging were(174,9) thick branches of trees furred
over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it
was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three (533,9)s. They
seemed clad(1911,8)skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched(1605,8)ment
that had survived nearly four years of(804,9). Standing in iron hoops
nailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and
though, when(1139,9)(1686,8)glided close under our stern, we six men(764,8)air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped
(1095,9)(378,10) of one ship to tho(1311,10)other; yet, those
forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not
one word to our own(549,10)(1482,8)the quarter-deck hail was being
he(1305,9)below.

“Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”

But as the strange c(1611,8)leani(471,8)the pallid bulwarks, was(1774,8)act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell(2018,9)
hand into the(570,9) the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to
make(1774,8) heard(1867,9)it. Meantime his ship was still increasing
(1623,10)ce between. While in various silent ways(182,8)men of the
Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident(1593,9)irst mere mentio(96,8)(460,12)’s name to another ship, Ahab for
a moment paused; i(796,9)seemed as though he would have lowered a
boat to board(565,12)r, had not the threatening wind forbade. But
taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized(599,12),
and knowing by her aspect that(159,13) vessel was a Nantucketer
and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is(486,11), bound rou(693,8)orld! Tell them to address all future letters
to the Pacific ocean! and this tim(1584,8)years, if I am not at home,
t(110,20)(126,8)——”

At that(526,8)the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,
in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,
that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side,
darted away with wha(723,9)shuddering fins, and ranged themselves
fore and aft(204,9)(732,9)’s flanks. Though(1941,8)cours(703,8)
continual voyagings Ahab must often(220,10)ve noticed a similar
sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously
carry meanings.

“Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gaz(1520,9)(1417,9)water.
There(1066,8)but little(267,8)words, but the tone conveyed more of
deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever(529,8)evinced.
But turning (1582,8)teersman, who thus far(581,10)holding the ship(1719,8)wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion
voice,—“Up helm! Keep her off(1032,17)”

R(1051,17)here is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;
but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through
numberless perils(327,8)very point whence we started, where those that
we left behind secure, were all the time(979,8)us.

Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
ever reach new(1964,9)s, and discover sights more sweet and(1718,8)
than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise
in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in
tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims
before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they
either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.


CHAPTER 53. The Gam.

The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
spoken was this: (973,9)and sea betokened storms. But even had this
not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
her—judging by his subsequent(894,8) on(1507,8) occasions—if so it had
been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer
to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not
to consort, even for five minutes, with any(1830,9) captain, except he
could contribute som(728,10)informa(169,8)so absorbingly sought. But
all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said
here(590,8)peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other
in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.

If two(310,9)s cross(1691,8)Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering
(212,10) in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of
them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment
to interchange the news; and(892,11)sitting down for a while and
resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the
illimitabl(390,15)and(351,16)s(1172,8)sea, two(572,8)
(572,8)descry(569,14) at the end(65,9)earth—off lone
Fanning’s Island(497,8) far away King’s Mills;(217,22),
I say, that under such circumstances these ships sh(1267,9)only
(396,12)hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and
sociable contact. A(805,14)would this seem to be a matter of
course, i(1438,10) of (926,8)owned in one seaport, and whose
captains, officers, and not a few(1624,8)men are personally known to(802,11); and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to
talk about.

F(835,8)ong absent ship, the outward-bounder(1657,13)s letters on
board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and
thumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy(228,19)
ship would receive the latest(1430,8) intelligence from the
(1376,15) to which she may be destined, a thing(1540,8)utmost
importance to her(198,9)degree, (1663,9)will hold true concerning
(167,8)(1597,8)(1494,9)(1593,10)’s track on the(1564,16)
itself, even though they are (1522,8)(565,12)from home. For on(1426,9) may have(338,8)d a transfer of(584,9)from some third(803,8)w
far remote vessel; and(1984,11)ose(654,9)may be(1564,9)peopl(1566,8) ship she now meets. Besides, the(1036,8)ex(1533,11)(502,8)news,
and have an agreeable chat. For(1208,9)(1110,9)ey meet with all the
sympathies of sailors, but likewise(49,13) peculiar
congenialities arising from(2027,10)pursuit and mutually shared
privations and perils.

Nor would difference of country make any very essential(46,11);
that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is(1368,9)
with Americans and English. Though, to(1110,8),(896,9) small number
of(54,8) whalers, such meetings do not very often occur(1464,8)en
they do occur there is too apt(1575,9)sort of shyness between them;
for your(197,8)man is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not
fancy that(110,9)thing in anybody but himself(725,14)(319,8)
whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the
(410,8)(343,8); regarding(1610,9), lean Nantucketer, with his
nondescript provincialisms, as(336,12)ea-peasant. But where this
(155,12)in(230,12) whalemen does really consist, it would be
hard to say, seeing that the Yankees(2006,8)day, collectively, kill
more whales than(945,9)English(53,16)in ten years. But this
is a harmless little foible(224,21)-hunters, which the
(367,11)(570,9) take much to heart; probably, because he knows
that he has a few foibles(603,9)

So, then, we see that of all ships separately sail(540,8)sea, the(650,9)have most reason(985,8)ociable—and(1655,10)so. Whereas, some
merchant ship(1768,24)wak(324,9)mid-Atlantic, will
oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
(1379,9)cutt(1897,14)(1889,8)high seas, like a brace of dandies
in Broadway; and(1532,9)time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism
upon(2026,14)rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at
(427,8)y first go through such a string of silly bowings and
scraping(1397,8)a ducking of ensigns,(876,9)r(1258,10) seem to be
much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As
touching Slave-ships(1543,8), why,(612,10)in(223,8)prodigious hurry,
they run away from(488,12)as soon as possible. And as for Pirates,
(374,20)cross(695,14)cross-bon(1478,8)first hail
is—“How many skulls?”—the same way that(1786,8) hail(50,10)
barrels?” And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer
apart, for(318,12)fernal villains on both sides, and don’t like to
see overmuch of(955,14)villanous likenesses.

But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable,(1114,9),
free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another
whaler in any(1947,9)decent weather? S(1361,9)“_Gam_,” a thing so
utterly unknown to all other ships(1685,9)y never heard of the name
even; and if b(977,10)hey should hear of it, they only grin at it,
and repeat gamesome stuff about “spouters” and “blubber-boilers,” and
such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and
also all(825,8) and Ma(1214,8)’s (43,8)(984,11) sailors, cherish
(1197,8)cornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a(784,10)it
would be hard to answer. Because,(1954,8)case of(821,8), say, I should
like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory
(1250,8). It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at
the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion,
he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I
conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,
(156,8)assertion the pirat(161,9)solid basis to stand on.

But what is a _Gam?_ You might wear out your index-finger running up
and down the columns of dictionari(1280,8)never find the word. Dr.
Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster’s ark(1857,9)
hold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years
been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees.
Certainly, it needs a definition, and(1184,8)be incorporated into the
Lexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.

GAM. NOUN—_A social(2037,8) of two_ (_or more_) _Whaleships, generally
on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they(23,8)e
visits by boats’ crews: the two captains remaining(1878,9) time, on

There i(1717,9) little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten
here. All(1198,11)s have their own(91,8)(1203,8)ities of detail; so

captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits(1450,8)stern
sheets on a comfortable,(1367,11)cushioned seat there, and often
steers(1197,9)with a(1785,8)little milliner’s tiller decorated with
gay cords and ribbons. But(298,10)-boat(1228,9)eat astern, no sofa
of that sort whatever, and no(122,8)at all. High times indeed, if
whaling(659,10)were wheeled abo(146,8)ater on castors like gouty old
aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller,(230,16)never
admits of any such effeminacy;(767,8)refore as in gamming a complete
boat’s crew must leave th(839,12)hence as the boat steerer or
harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is(609,8)ersman upon the

from the sid(57,10)two ship(1656,9)(166,8)(949,11)all alive to

is this any very easy matter; for(1051,8)rear(426,8)immense projecting
steering oar hitting him now(1399,8)n(1099,9)mall of his back, the
after-oar reciprocating by rapp(216,8)knees in front. He is thus
(707,8)ly wedged before and behind, and can only expand(1165,8)
sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent
pitch(760,8)boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a
spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,

CHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho’s Story.

(_As told at the Golden Inn._)

The Cape of Good Hope, and all(1977,10)y region roun(2007,11)re, is
much like some noted four corners of a great highway(371,8)you meet
more travellers than in any other part.

It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another
homeward-bound whaleman, t(319,10),* was encountered. She was manned
almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us
strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest(1606,8)White
Whale was now wildly heightened by a circums(1834,9)(238,11)’s
story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain
wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of
God which at times are said to overta(611,8)men. This latter
(227,12), with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may
be(156,8)the secret par(1509,9)tragedy(771,8)o be narrated, never
reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that(111,15)
the story was unknown to(1190,13)(462,14)(1993,8). It was the
private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of
whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of
secrecy, but the following night(69,10)rambled(1623,8)sleep, and
revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could
not well withhold the rest. (1625,12), so potent an influence did
this thing have on(743,8)eamen(942,8)Pequod who came(455,8)full
knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were
they governed in this matter, that they kept(733,12)among
themselves so that it never transpired abaft(208,11)’s main-mast.
Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread(1108,10)story as
publicly(855,9) o(1361,8)ip, the whole of this(288,9)affair I now
proceed to put on lasting record.

*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,
still used by whalemen in hunt(1677,8)famous Gallipagos terrapin.

For my humor’s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once
(298,9)it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one
saint’s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza(1614,8)Golden
Inn. O(1513,8)fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were
on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they
occasionally put, an(1636,9)re duly answered at the time.

“Some two years prior to my first learn(479,8)events(406,9)am about
rehearsing to you, gentlemen,(1928,12), Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,
was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail eastward
(700,9)eaves(830,9)good Golden Inn. She was somewher(1196,8)
northward(1804,8)Line. One morn(559,9)handl(760,8)pumps, according
to daily usage, it was observed(1656,8)e made more water in her hold
than common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her(381,11). But
(1866,11), having some unusual reason for believing that rare good
luck awaited him i(1539,8)latitudes; and therefore being very averse to
quit them,(46,8) leak not being then consid(691,8)all dangerous,
though, indeed, they could not find it after search(1186,8)hold as low
down as was possible in rather heavy weather,(1437,9) still continued
her(696,9)s, the mariners working(887,8)pumps at wide and easy
intervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was
(331,9)yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that
now tak(549,9)alarm, (581,13)making all sail, stood away for the
nearest harbor among the islands, t(888,8)have his hull hove out and
repaired.

“Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
favoured, he did not(611,8)fear that his ship would founder by the
way, because his pumps were(1579,8)best, and being periodically
reliev(1422,9)m, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the
ship free; never mind(250,8)leak should double on her. In truth, well
nigh the whole(1332,9)(351,8)being attended by very prosperous
breezes(1515,13) had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at
her port without the occurrenc(348,9)least fatality, had it not been
for the brutal overbearing of Radney(936,8)te, a Vineyarder(1174,9)
bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from
Buffalo.

“‘Lakeman!—Buffalo! Pray, what is(73,10)(1988,8)ere is Buffalo?’
said Don Sebastian, r(1842,9)his swinging mat of grass.

“On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your
courtesy—may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,
(1681,9), in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as
large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far
Manilla; this(368,10)in the land-locked heart(290,8)America, had yet
been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly
connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,
those grand fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and
Superior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many
of the ocean’s noblest traits;(41,10) of its rimmed varieties of
races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic
isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by
two great contrasting nations,(89,8)Atlantic is; they furnish long
maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,
dotted all round their banks; here(1212,8)re are frowned upon by
batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they
have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they
yiel(194,9)e(277,9)wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash
from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and(12,10)re flanked by
ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried
lines of kings in Gothic genealogies;(2027,8)ame woods harboring wild
Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give
robes to Tartar Emperor(671,8)mirror the paved capitals of(1645,8) and
Cleveland, as well as Winnebago village(759,9)loat alike the
full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser(2013,8)State, the steamer,
and the beech canoe; they are swept by Bore(1925,8)ismasting blasts as
direful(1593,13)lash the salted wav(92,8)know what shipwrecks
are, for(1638,8)sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full
many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, (1864,10)
though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and(21,11)
(1725,8); as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney(132,9)in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket
beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; (107,10)after life he had long
followed our auster(1434,11)and your contemplative Pacific; yet was
he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel(1627,8)backwoods
seaman, fresh(1474,10)latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet
was this(296,10)er a man with some good-hearted(1889,9)and this
Lakeman, a(457,8), who(331,8)a sort of devil indeed, might yet by
inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human
recognition which is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this
(728,10)(495,8) been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he
had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and(136,10)—but(910,12) you shall hear.

“It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her
prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again
increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more(153,8)pumps
every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our
(907,8), for example, some skippers think little of pumping their
whole way across it(1049,9)of a still, sleepy night, should the
offic(1643,10)deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the
probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again
remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.
Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you(64,8)westward,
(700,11)is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their
pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length;
that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other
reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is
in some very(2024,8)the way part of those waters, some really landless
(1524,8),(544,8)r captain begins to feel a(755,8)anxious.

“Much this way had it been with(1018,12); so when her leak was found
gaining once more, there was in tru(1614,8)small concern manifested by
several of her company; especially by(1348,8)the mate. He commanded the
upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way
expanded(786,9)reeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as(1111,11)a
coward, and(27,11)inclined to any(1825,9)nervous apprehensiveness
touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or
on sea that you can conveniently imagine(1652,11). Therefore(509,8)
betrayed this solicitude about the safety(1282,8)ship, some of the
seamen declared that it was only(1203,15)his being a part owner
in her. So when they were working that even(1102,10) pumps(672,11)
on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they
stood(822,9)ir feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear
water; clear(477,8)mountain spring(411,11)—that bubbling from the
pumps ran(1728,8)(1669,8), and poured itself out in steady spouts at
the lee scupper-holes.

“Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional
world of ours—watery or otherwise; that(1339,8)person placed in(1007,8)
over his fellow-men finds on(621,8)m to be very significantly his
superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he
conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a
chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make
(1512,9)heap of dust of it. Be(399,9)ceit of mine as it may(1973,13)at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a
head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled
housings of your last viceroy’s snorting charger; and a brai(108,8)
heart(121,8)soul in him(1250,11), which had made(230,10)
Charlemagne, had he been born son to (37,11)’s father. But(1572,8)
(1705,8), was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.
He did not lov(168,11), and(413,11)knew it.

“Espying(1836,9) drawing near as he was toil(1315,15)(1227,9)
rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with
his gay banterings.

“‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,
one of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I
tell ye what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut
away his part(1796,8)hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that
sword-fish only began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of
ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file(15,11)what not; and the whole
posse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slash(1899,11)bottom;
making improvements, I suppose. If(362,8) were here now, I’d tell him
to jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re pla(761,9)devil with his
estate, I can(93,9). But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad(1215,8)beauty
too. Boys, they say the rest of his property i(576,8)ed in
looking-glasses. I wonder if he’d give a poor devil like me the model
of his nose.’

“‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared(1191,9)pretending(983,8)have heard the sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’(978,14)sir,’ sai(1183,11), merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys,
lively, now!’ And(1166,8)(1185,12)clanged like fifty fire-engines;
the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping
of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s
utmost energies.

“Quitt(1437,8)pump at last,(1403,9)(590,13)band(1415,14)went
forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face
fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wip(172,9)rofuse sweat from his
brow. Now what cozening fiend it was(1912,13)that possess(648,9)
to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated (984,9)know
not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding alo(1070,9)ck,(1841,9)
commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a
shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a
pig to run at large.

“Now(340,13)sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household
work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
founder(1606,11)time. Such(575,13)is the inflexibility of
sea-usages(1740,9)instinctive love of neatness in seamen;(407,8) whom
would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all
vessels this broom business(196,8)prescriptive province of the boys,
if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the
Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns(1994,8)pumps;
and be(1881,8)most athletic seaman of them all,(1526,10)(114,9)
(576,11)ssigned captain of on(248,9)gangs;(788,11)ly he should
have been freed from any trivial(356,10)not connecte(1608,8)ruly
nautical duties, such(223,11)case with his comrades. I mention all
these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair
stood between the two men.

“But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
plainly meant to sting and insult(1956,12)as though Radney had spat
in(1592,9). Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
(268,11)this; and all this and doubtless much more(1782,13)
fully comprehended when(1459,9) uttered(438,8)mand. But as he sat
still for a moment, and(34,8)teadfastly look(800,8)(1557,8)’s
malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him
(1186,8)slow-match silently burn(1692,11)owards them; as he
(1240,11)ly saw(331,9), that strange forbearance and unwillingness
to stir up the deeper passionate(1319,8)any already ireful being—a
repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when
aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling(1780,14)tole over
(1136,9).

“Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that(1934,9)
the deck was not his(1542,9), and he (1650,10)do it. And then,
(1651,8)at all alluding to(1009,11), he pointed to three lads as the
customary sweepers; who, not being billeted(1530,13), had done
little or nothing all day. To this,(1076,8)repli(1396,8)an oath, in a
most domineer(1159,8)outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his
command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated(1095,8),(150,8)
uplifted cooper’s club hammer which he had snatch(1646,9) cask near
by.

“Heated and irritate(1108,8)was by his spasmodic toil(360,15)for
all his first(772,10)feeling of(976,13)the sweating(1905,10)
could but ill brook this bearing i(1331,10); but somehow still
smother(1805,9)onflagration within him, (667,8)speaking he remained
doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed(1653,8)shook the
(398,8)ithin a few inches of(1681,9), furiously(1530,8)ing him to do
his bidding.

“(1777,9) rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
followed(1080,8)mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated
his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his(1492,13)had
not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intim(469,10)
his twisted h(1176,8)arned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it
was to no purpose. And in this way the two went once(378,9)(367,8)
(367,8); when, resolved(564,9)no longer to(434,8), bethinking him
that(961,8)now forborne as much as comport(1196,8)his humor, the
Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke(1426,8)officer:

“‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that(1142,8)away, or look to
yourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
the(1282,8) stood fixed, now(879,10) heavy(1283,9)ithin an inch of
his teeth(1401,12)repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.

with the unflinching poniard(1053,8)glance,(1311,10), clench(1609,8)right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his
persecutor that if the(1604,8)but grazed his cheek he ((1454,9)) would
murder him. But, gentlemen,(891,9) had been branded for the slaughter
by the gods. Immediately(150,12)touched the cheek; the next instant
the lower jaw of(1251,11)as stove in his head; he fell(804,13)
spouting blood like a whale.

“Ere the cry could go aft(1741,10) was shaking one(138,8)backstays
leading far aloft to where two(1572,8)comrades were standing their
mastheads. They were both Canallers.

“‘(14,9)!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in our
harbours, but never heard of your(115,11) Pardon: who and what are
they?’(147,13), Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.
You must have(141,10)it.’

“‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts(1489,9)dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary
land, we know but little(246,9)vigorous North.’

“‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and ere
proceeding further(1417,8)tell ye what (378,13) are; for such
information may throw side-light upon my story.’

“For three hundred and sixty miles(992,15)rough the entire
breadth(889,8)state of New York;(53,9)numerous populous cities and
most thriving villages(61,10)long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and
affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room

arches over Indian river(213,11)sun and shade; by happy hearts or
broken(324,10)all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk
counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires
stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly
corrupt and often lawless life. There’s your true Ashantee(1644,11);
there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;
under the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.
For by some curious fatality, as it is often note(1349,10)metropolitan
freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so
sinner(949,14)most abound in holiest vicinities.

“‘Is that a friar passing?’ sai(1600,11), looking downwards into the
crowded plazza, with humorous concern.

“‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in
Lima,’ laughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’

“‘A moment! Pardon(1823,9)another(1973,8)company. ‘In the name of all
us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by
no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for
distant Venice in your (870,8)comparison. Oh! do not bow and look
surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast—“C(968,8)s Lima.”
It but bears out your saying, too;(821,9) more plentiful than

Venice; I have been there;(1471,9) city(1712,8)blessed evangelist, St.

“Freely depicted in his own vocation(1908,15)e(2033,9) would
make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is
he. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery
Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked
Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,
all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which(352,13)
so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his
grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence(1141,8)villages
(2029,8)which he floa(139,9)wart visage and bold swagger are not
unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond o(634,10)canal,(822,8)received

fain be not ungrateful; but(1816,13)(92,10) prime redeeming
qualities(1847,10)an of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm
to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In
sum(1887,13)what the wildness of this canal life is, is
emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so
many of its most finished graduat(1339,8)that scarce any race of
mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling
captains. Nor does it at all diminish the curious(281,13)matter,
that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its
line,(1712,8)bationary lif(859,9)Grand Canal furnishes the sole
transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and
recklessly ploughing the waters(1646,8)most barbaric seas.

“‘I see! I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spill(1321,8)chicha
upon his silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one Lima. I
had thought, now(857,10)your temperate North the generations were
cold and holy as the hills.—But the story.’

“I left off(854,15)ere the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly
had he done so, when he was surround(873,8)e three junior mates and

the ropes like baleful comets, the two(1342,10) rushed into the
uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.
Oth(634,11)sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted
turmoil ensued; while standing(135,8)harm’s way, the valiant captain
danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling (715,9)officers to
manhandle(1515,8)rocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the
quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up(1961,8)revolving border of
the confusion, and prying(447,9) hear(412,8)with his pike,(462,10)
prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his
desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the
(557,10) deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks
in a line(598,9) windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves
behind the barricade.

“‘Come(752,8)that, ye pirates!’ roared the(623,8), now menacing them
with a pistol in each hand, just br(875,9)him(1068,8)steward. ‘Come

“(427,10)leaped on(209,14), and striding(785,13)there,
defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave(248,12) to
understand distinctly, that his ((590,9)’s) death would be the signal
for a murderous mutiny(208,8)part of all hands. Fearing in his heart
lest this might prove but too true,(193,13)a little desisted, but
still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.

“‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ de(107,10)ir
ringleader.

“‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no(94,8);—to your duty! Do you want to
sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? (118,8)’ and he
once more raised(736,9).

“‘S(99,12)?’ cried(1101,10). ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us
turns to, unless you swear(319,8)raise a rope-yarn against us. What
say ye, men?’ turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was(382,8)esponse.

“The Lakeman now patrolle(1081,15), all the while keeping his eye
on the C(1073,8)and jerk(1748,8)such sentences as these:—‘It’s not our
fault; we didn’t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was
boy’s business; he might have known me before this(95,13)no(1618,11)the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here(431,9)his

the cruise, d’ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we do(786,9)a row; it’s
not our interest; we(1304,8) be peaceable(461,17) work, but we

it is now,(1091,10)rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby
rascal,(625,10)lift a hand(1351,9)ye(1404,9)e attack us; but till

“‘Down into(983,19)n, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there till
ye’re sick of it. Down ye go.’

“‘Shall we(1682,9)the (1888,10)(1559,8)men. Most(726,8) w(1197,11)

(237,8)ir dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.

“As(980,12)’s bare head was just level with the planks,(1669,12)
and his posse leap(1750,19)nd rapidly drawing over the slide
of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called
for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
companionway. Then open(68,8)slide a little(268,13) whispered
something down the crack, closed(190,9)turned the key upon them—ten
in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had
remained neutral.

“All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
aft, especially about(1883,16)scuttle and fore hatchway; at
which last place it was fe(1283,9)insurgents might emerge, after
breaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed
in peace; the men who still (322,9)at(884,8)uty toiling har(27,8)

tossed after it; when again tur(892,9)(802,13) and pocketing it,

(1933,9)a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;
and suddenly four men burst up from(1787,15), saying they were
ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air(444,8)famishing diet,
united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained
them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by thi(1652,15)reiterated his deman(489,9)rest, but(1868,10) shouted up to him a
terrific hint to stop his babbl(957,8)betake himself where he
belonged. On the fif(533,11)three other(345,9)mutineers bolted up(1998,9) air(461,10)desperate arms below that sought to restrain
them. Only three were left.

with no opposition(1966,8)par(445,8) other two; they swore(1511,17)for that, or for any other mad thing,(25,8)thing in short but a

their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for(1463,8);
particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one(1623,8)other,
in the matter; and both of them c(71,9)be first, for the ladder
would but admit one man at a time. And here(1279,15)e foul play
of these miscreants must come out.

“Upon hear(410,9)rantic projec(1046,11)leader,(472,8) his own
separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece
of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be
(603,9)(1873,8)three, though(899,10)(30,8)en, to (718,9); and
thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might
merit. But when(1467,11)made known his determination still to lead

villany, mixed their before secret(370,9)ies togeth(691,8)(910,8)ir
leader fell into a doze, verbally open(98,9)souls to each other in
three sentences(793,8)und the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with
cords; and shrieked out(834,9)Captain at midnight.

“Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark(915,9)blood, he
and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed(980,9)forecastle. In a
few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious
allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been
fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along
the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seiz(231,14)
mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and the(1825,8)hung till
morning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried(611,12), pacing to and fro(862,8)them,
‘the vultur(1598,13)touch ye, ye villains!’

former that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought(1499,10)

a reprimand, which he accordingly administered(1029,8)vernacular.

“‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning(1460,8)three men in the
rigging—‘(70,9)I mean to mince ye up(1228,9)try-pots;’ and, seizing
a rope, he applied it with(1184,9)might(1597,8)backs(1810,9)wo
traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessl(797,8)heir heads
sideways, as(89,8) crucified thieves are drawn.

“‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still
rope enough left(406,10)my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up. Take
that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’

“For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
cramped jaws(1176,9)n painfully twisting round his head, said in a
sort of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I
murder you!’

“‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—an(1308,13) drew off with
the rope to strike.

“‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman(886,9)I must,(100,10)rope was once mo(610,8) bac(1976,10)stroke.

“Steelkilt here(107,8)out something, inaudible to all but(1518,12);
who,(987,8)amazement of(1439,10), started back, paced (1753,8)
rapidly two or three time(499,12)suddenly throwing down his rope,
said, ‘I won’t do it—let him go—cut him down: d’ye hear?’

“But(942,8)junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale
man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever
since the blow,(1640,8)lain in his berth; but that morning, hea(1544,8)
tumult on(357,9)(76,9)crept ou(2023,9)us far had watched(1703,10) scene. Such was the state of(1051,12)(1814,8)could hardly
speak; but mumbling(602,10) about _his_ being willing and able to do
what the c(836,8)ared not attempt, he sn(190,10) rope and advanced
to his pinioned foe.

“‘You are a coward!(884,25)So I am, but take that.’ The mate was(1830,11)y act of striking,
when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused:(1271,12)using

might have been. T(1950,13)were then cut down,(980,10) were
turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps
clanged as before.

“Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor
was heard(406,8)forecastle;(1613,8) two trembling traitors running up,
besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.
Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
instance they were put down(638,8)ship’s run for salvation. Still, no
sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,
that mainly at(628,13)instigation, they had resolved to maintain
the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders(1642,8)last, and, when the
ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the
speediest end(1751,8)voyage, they all agreed to(974,9)thing—namely,
not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,
(968,9)her leak, and(991,10)all her other perils, the Town-Ho still
(357,8)ed her mast-heads, and her(1369,9)was just as(1421,9)to lower
for a fish(1657,8)ment, as(1640,9)ay his craft first struck the
cruising ground; and (1806,11)(1347,9)quite as ready to change his
berth for a boat, and with his(1915,10)mouth seek to gag in death the
vital jaw of the whale.

“But though(1538,12) had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
passivenes(1553,8)ir conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till
all was over) concerning(56,9)proper and private revenge upon the
man who had stung him(1701,10)ntricles(1999,8)heart. H(1740,9)Radney
the chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more
than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he
insisted, against the express(332,9)of the(730,8), upon resuming the
head(247,8)watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other
circumstances,(1898,10) systematically built the plan(357,8)revenge.

“During the night,(785,8)had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
bulwarks(713,8)quarter-deck, and lea(568,9)arm(541,9) gunwale of
the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above(1642,12)side. In
this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a
considerable vacancy between (167,9)(1982,8)ship, and down(40,8)
this was(939,8).(420,11)calculated his time, and found that his
next trick(647,8)helm would come round at two o’clock,(1924,8)morning
of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his
leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully
in(747,10)es below.

“‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate(48,10)do you think? what does it look like?’

“‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’

“‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said(1442,12), holding it at arm’s length
before him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough
twine,—have you any?’(1585,9)(705,8)none(1376,8)forecastle.

“‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.

“‘You don’t mean(29,8) begging to _him!_(437,10)ailor.

“‘Why not? D(439,11) he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help
himself(1591,8)end,(531,9)?’ and going to(1994,9), he looked at him
quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given
him—neither twine nor(609,9)were seen again; but the next night an
iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled(943,8)e pocket of the
Lakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tuc(845,8) coat into(216,12)

du(440,9)seaman’s hand—that fatal hour(1359,8)n to come; and in the
fore-ordaining soul of(1818,10),(537,9) was already stark and
stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.

“But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer(465,10)bloody
deed(1410,8)planned. Yet complete(1969,8) he had, and without being the
avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in
to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing (236,8) have
done.

“It was just(1861,9)daybreak and sunrise of(1718,12)(15,8)second
day, when they were washing d(143,9)ecks, that a stupid Teneriffe
man, drawing water(1834,9)ain-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There
she rolls! there (17,10)’ Jesu, what a whale!(1083,8)Moby Dick.

“‘(14,9)!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do
whales have christenings? Whom call you(120,10)?’

“‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but
that would be too long a story.’

“‘How? how?(225,8)all the young Spaniards, crowding.

“‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more
into the air, Sirs.’

“‘The chicha! t(12,10)(388,12)Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks
faint;—fill up his empty glass!’

his voice for the(592,10)though(1920,10)little time past it had been
plainly behel(1814,11)three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.
‘The White Whale—t(16,14)!’(1641,8) cry from captain, mates, and
harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to
capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed
askance(1556,10) curses, the appalling beauty(1382,8)vast milky mass,
that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a
living opal(1374,8)blu(1495,10)sea. G(1839,12)strange(1697,9)
pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out
before the world(1773,8)was charted. The mutineer(499,9)bowsman of
the ma(1318,8)when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,
while Radney stood up with his lance(1670,8)prow, and haul in or
slacken the line, at(216,8)d of command. Moreover(1832,10) four boats
were lowered, (219,8)’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely
with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a
stiff pull, their (842,10) got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney
sprang to(434,8). He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.
And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back.
Nothing loath, his(580,9)hauled him up and up, through a blinding
foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat
struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the
standing mate. That instan(475,9)fell(273,16)slippery back,

tossed over (1998,9)sea,(399,8)other flank(1760,8)whale. He struck
out(368,9)the spray, and, for an(224,10)was dimly seen(55,11)at
veil, wildly seeking to remove himself(1684,10)eye of Moby Dick. But
(581,9) rushed round in(463,10)maelstrom; seized the swimmer
between his jaws; and rearing high(1118,11)m, plunged headlong again,
and went down.

“Meantim(1118,10)first tap(1585,8)boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had(1191,8)ed(1193,11)so as to drop astern(1975,10)whirlpool; calmly
looking on, he thought his own(16,8)s. But(769,9), terrific,
downward jerking(188,12), quickly br(88,10)knife(1097,8)line. He
cut it; and(1017,10) was free. But, at some distance,(494,10) rose
again, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the
teeth that had destroyed him. All(1509,11) gave chase again; but the
whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.

“In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary
place—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the
Lakeman, all but five or six(1009,8)foremastmen deliberately deserted
among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double
war-canoe(1130,8)savages, and setting sail for som(1184,8)harbor.

“The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving
down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over
their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both
by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,
that (286,9)vessel(353,9)ady again for sea, they were in such a
weakened condition that(392,13)durst not put off with them in so
heavy a vessel. After taking counsel(1445,8)s officers, he anchored the
ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon
(1683,9)bows; stacked his muskets(1998,8)poop; and warning the
(615,10)not to approach(575,10)at their peril, took one man with
him(810,14)the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight
before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a
reinforcement to his crew.

“On the fourth day(1004,10)il,(1042,9)canoe was descried, which
seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He(231,9)away from
it(1461,9) savage craft bore down on him; and so(753,8)oice of
Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The
(1143,8)presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow(1906,8)yoked(1334,10)s, the Lakeman laugh(154,10)scorn; assuring him that if the
pistol so much as clicked(1260,9)ock,(212,10)bury(1291,8)bubbles and
foam.

“‘What do you want of me?’ cried(1398,12).

“‘Where are you bound? and for what(28,15)’ demanded (397,9);
‘no lies.’

“‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’

“‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he
leaped (1033,9)canoe, swam to the boat; and climb(930,8)gunwale,
stood face to face(1269,9)(298,13)Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As
soon as(316,10) leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder
island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike
me!’

“‘A pretty scholar,’(705,9)(725,11). ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping
into the sea, he swam back(1158,9)omrades.

“Watch(1319,8)boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the
roots(1216,8)cocoa-nut trees,(346,11)made sail again, and in due
time arrived at(1390,9)his own place of destination. There, luck
befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were
providentially in(944,9)precisely that number of men whi(1697,8)ailor

“Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the(1814,11)(397,8),

Tahitians, who had been somewhat used(1053,8)sea. Chartering a small
native schooner, he returned(1055,9)m(1894,8)vessel; and finding all
right there, again resumed his cruisings.

“Where(1048,11)now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns(257,11) which refuses to
give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
destroyed him.  * * * *

“‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.(1616,8), Don.’

“‘Then I entreat you, tell me if(1527,9)est of your own convictions,
this your story is in substance really true? It is so passing
wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me

CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.

I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
something like the true form(1323,8)whale as he actually appear(1912,8)
ey(1029,9)whaleman when in his own absolute body(90,11)is moored
alongside(120,10)-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.
It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious
imaginary portraits of him which even down(1957,8)present day
confidently challenge the faith(1672,8)landsman. It is time to set the
world right in this matter, by proving such p(547,11)(441,11)ll
wrong.
(283,11)that(1544,8)mal source of all those pictorial delusions will
be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For
ever(789,9)ose inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues(1118,9)shields,
medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of
chain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever
(1054,9)n has (923,10)of the same sort of license prevailed, not
only in most popular(536,22), but in many scientific
presentation(753,8).

Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant(814,9) anyways purporting
to b(990,11)’s, is to (595,9)in the famous cavern-pagoda of
Elephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that(79,8)almost endless
(649,10) of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,
every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages(1810,8)any of
them(1366,10)came into being. No wonder then,(212,9)so(524,9)ur
noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The
Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department(1578,9)all,
depicting the incarn(280,9)Vishnu(486,9)orm of leviathan, learnedly
known as the Matse Avatar. But though this(1113,10) is half man and
half(753,8)so as only to give the tail(1423,10)tter, yet that small
sec(473,8)him is all wrong. It looks more(1864,11)apering(96,9)an
anaconda, than the broad palm(1464,9)tru(800,9) majestic flukes.

But go(1652,8)old Galleri(1245,8)look now at a great Christian
painter’s(937,10)of this fish; for he succeeds no better(181,9)
antediluvian Hindoo(1729,8)Guido’s(1677,8) of Perseus rescuing
Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model
of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in pain(673,8)
same scene in his own “(181,8)Descending,” make out one whit better.
The huge corpulence(1115,9)Hogarthian (227,8)undulates on the
surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a(1550,9)howdah on
its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are
rolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading(460,10)Thames
by water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old
Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s(1736,8)as depicte(1598,9)print(68,9)Bibles and the cu(27,9) primers. What shall be said of these? As for
the book-binder(130,8) winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a
d(594,9) anchor—as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of
many books both old and new—that is a very(909,8)sque but purely
fabulous(824,9), imitated, I take it,(934,10)like figures on
antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless
call this(352,15)fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so
intended when the device was first introduced. It was(19,11) by an
old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, dur(1108,8)Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a
comparatively late period,(318,8)s were popularly supposed to be a
specie(1616,9)L(1886,8).

In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you
will at times meet with very curious touches at the(1923,8)where all
manner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and
Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the
(847,10)(2046,8)original edi(2032,8)the “Advancement(468,12)”(271,10)find some(257,9)whal(1968,9)quitting all these unprofessional(739,8)s, let us glance at those
(964,8) of l(466,8) purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,
by those who know. In old Harris’s collec(257,8)voyages(1456,11)some
plates of(1457,8)extracted from a Dutch book(71,11), A.D. 1671,
entitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen(1496,8)ship Jonas in the
Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the
whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among
ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another
plate, the prodigious blunder is made of(137,10)ing(864,10) with
perpendicular flukes.

Then agai(1916,9)is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain
Colnett, a Post(24,8)(1907,8)English navy, (474,12)Voyage round
Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extend(1370,8)Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In(1605,10) is an outline(808,14)
be a “Picture of a Physeter or (101,11)whale, drawn by scale from
one kill(1963,10)coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.”
I doubt not the captain had this veracious(1991,8) taken(300,8)
benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say
that it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,
to a full grown sperm(1534,9)ould make the eye of that whale a
bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant(301,8), why did ye not
give us Jonah looking out(113,9)eye!

Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History(387,20)the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of
mistake. Look at that(2021,8) work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In
the abridged London(1740,12)1807(1021,8)ar(1280,9)of an alleged
“whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this
unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as(725,9)(119,8), one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this
nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon
any intelligent public of schoolboy(1372,8),(1373,8)in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great
naturalist, published a(1992,12)systemized whale book, wherein are
several(1065,8)s(657,8)different speci(25,10)Leviathan. All these
are not only incorrec(479,9)e(1159,9)of the Mysticetus or Greenland
whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long
experienced man as touching tha(203,9), declares not to have its
counterpart in nature.

B(201,8)lacing(951,8)cap-sheaf to all thi(1918,9)ing business was
reserved(1716,9)(427,11)Frederick Cuvier, brother(1339,8)famous
Baron. In 1836, he(509,13)(1135,16)of Whales, in which he
gives what he calls a(422,16)Sperm Whale. Before show(335,8)
(1629,9)o any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary
retreat from(64,10). In a word,(281,17)’s(153,12) is
not a(174,12), but a squash. Of course, he never had the (1803,10)
a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived(275,13), who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his(941,12)predecessor
in(1526,10)field, Desmarest, got one(1983,8)authentic abortions; that
is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the
pencil those(68,9)are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.

A(1442,9) sign-painters’ whales seen (241,8)treets hanging over the
shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally
Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;
breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts(1622,8)s whaleboats full of
mariners: their deformities flo(1080,9)in seas of blood and blue
paint(1170,10)se manifold mistakes in depicting the whale (1446,8)so very
surprising after all. Consider! Most(1552,8)(1622,11)drawings have
been taken from(455,8)anded fish; and these are about as correct as a
drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would(64,8)ly represent
the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.
Though elephants have stoo(1467,9)ir full-lengths, the living
(1826,9) has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The
living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen
at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out
of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element
it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily
into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.
And,(2047,8)speak(2004,8)highly presumable difference of contour
between a young suck(435,9) and a full-grown Platonian (544,9);
yet, ev(1281,10)case of(1503,8)those(96,20)s hoisted to a
ship’s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying
shape of him, that his precise expression the devil(710,9)could not
catch.

But it may be fancied, th(2032,8)the naked skeleton(1133,9)tranded
whale, accurate hints(83,8)(1913,9)ouching his true form. Not at
all. For it is(346,10)e more curious things about this(424,10),
(268,9)(170,9)gives very little idea(1939,8)general shape. Though
Jeremy Bentham’(78,10), which hangs for candelabra(1819,8)library of
(2044,11)executors,(1295,11)conveys th(150,10)a burly-browed
utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal
characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any
l(1325,8)’s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the
mere(582,17)whale bears the same relation to the fully
invested and padded(1601,8)as the insect does(59,8)chrysalis that so
roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the
head, as in some part(338,9)book will be incidentally shown. It is
also very(738,8)ly display(106,9) side fin, the bones of which
almost exactly answer(312,8)(44,9)the human hand, minu(1672,8)he
thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,
and(873,8)finger. But all these are permanently lodg(339,9)ir fleshy
covering(594,9)human fingers in an artificial (48,8). “However
recklessly(615,11)may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one
day, “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.”

For(255,11)reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
conclude that(869,11)(1703,9) (738,8)one creature(1713,8)world
which must remain unpainted(873,8)last. True, one portrait may hit the
mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very
considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding
out(1784,8)ly w(282,8)whale really looks like. And the only mode in
which you can derive even a tolerab(1592,15)living contour, is by
going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of
being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you
had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity(1947,10)this
(1873,9).


CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True
(33,16)ing Scenes.

In connexion with the monstrous p(94,11)whales, I am strongly
tempted here to enter upon those still mor(88,12)stori(1307,9)m
which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass
that matter by.

I know of only four published outli(1508,11)great Sperm Whale;
Colnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous
chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to.(110,10) is far
bett(1070,8)theirs; but, by great odds,(132,8) is the best. All
(25,8)drawings(1902,9)whale are good, excepting the middle figure in
the(602,8) of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second(273,8). His frontispiece, boats attacking(400,12)s, though no
doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is
admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the
(562,11)(350,10)in J. Ross Browne are prett(107,10)in(1289,8);
but they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.

Of the Right Whale,(515,9)(748,8)(1044,10)are in Scoresby; (128,8)
are drawn on to(1383,8)a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has
but o(115,10)(1158,8)ing scen(1260,10)is is a sad deficiency,
because it is by such(1238,11)nly, when at all well done, that you
(1688,11)anything like a truthful(1696,9)the(1696,8)whale as seen by
(1724,11)hunters.

But, taken for all in all, by far the finest(700,9)in some details
not the most(645,8), presentation(1474,11) and(327,15) to be
anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and
taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent
attacks on the Sperm and(663,12)(1312,9)first(148,10) a nobl(849,14)is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath
the boat from the profundit(1725,10) ocean, and bearing high in the
air upon his back the terrific wreck(1599,8)stoven planks. The prow of(140,10)is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing(1934,8)e
monster’s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single
incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
incensed boiling spout(1861,8)whale, and in the act of leaping, as if
from a precipice. The action(76,10)ole thing is wonderfully good and
true. The half-emptied line-tub float(656,9)whitened sea; the wooden
pol(533,10)spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the head(588,8)
swimming crew are scattered about(289,10)(1530,8)rasting ex(1343,8)s
of affright; while(330,8)black stormy distance the ship is(708,8)
down(570,9) scene. Seriou(1592,8)might be found with the anatomical
details of this(476,8)but let that pass; since(631,8)e life of me, I
could not draw so good a one.

In the second(1186,10), (822,12)(588,14)drawing alongside
the barnacled flank of a large running(1821,16)at rolls his
black weedy bulk(704,8)sea like some mossy rock-slide(1119,9)
Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black(91,8)ot; so
th(1202,8)so abounding a smok(521,9)chimney, you would think there
must be a brave supper cook(1067,9)e great bowels below. Sea fowls are
pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and
maccaroni, which the(1547,12) sometimes carries on his pestilent
back. And all(966,8)le the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through
the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and
causing the slight boat to roc(559,10)wells like a skiff caught nigh
the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all
raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic(1134,9), is the
glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched s(1043,10)e
powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead(1563,9) conquered
fortress,(1152,10)flag of capture lazily hanging(1998,10)whale-pole
inserted into his spout-hole.

Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he
was either practically conversant with his subject, or else
marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the
lads for painting action. Go and gaze upon(810,9)(42,8)s of Europe,
and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing
(631,9) on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the
beholder fights his way, pell-mell,(958,8) the consecutive great
battles of France(95,8)every sword seems a flash(2018,8)Northern
Lights(697,10)successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a
charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place(308,8)
gallery,(492,8)se sea battle-pieces of(711,8).

The natural aptitude(222,8)French for seiz(1205,8)picturesqueness of
things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what(590,11)a(1962,12)s
they hav(130,8)ir whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s
(774,10)(2028,8)fishery, and not the thousandth part of that(1168,8)Americans, (148,10)nevertheless furnished both nations(1151,10)only
finished sketches at all capable of convey(1553,8)real spiri(140,9)whale hunt. For the most part, the English and (187,8) whale
draughtsmen seem entirely conte(1135,8)present(1688,8)mechanical
outline of things, such as the vacant profil(570,9)whale; which, so
far as(571,19) effect is concerned, is about tantamount to
sketch(648,9)(116,10)a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned
Right(1316,9), after giving us a stiff full lengt(1009,9)Greenland
(1670,8)nd three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and
porpoises, treats us to a series of classical(803,11) of boat hooks,
chopping knives, and grapnels; and(1810,10)microscopic diligence of a
Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six
fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement
to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so
important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured
for every(178,8) a sworn affidavit taken before a(541,10) Justice of
the Peace.

In addition to those fine(482,12)from(1441,8), there are two other
French(534,12)(1554,10)note, by some one who subscribes himself
“H. Durand.” O(993,8)em, though not precisely adapted to our(1072,8)
purpose,(1309,14)deserves men(2018,8)other accounts. It is a quiet
noon-scene among the isles(1899,8)Pacific; a(1688,8)whaler anchored,
inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened
sail(115,9)ship(2003,10)long leav(148,10)palms(1640,8)background,
both drooping together(42,9)reezeless air. The(1287,11)very fine,
when considered with reference to its(1468,16)hardy fishermen
under o(482,9)ir few aspects of oriental repose. The other(1949,10)
is quite a different affair:(302,9) hove-to upon the open sea, and in
the very he(1913,9)e Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside;
the vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over(1229,8)monster as if to
a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,
(1712,9)giving chase to whale(547,9)distance. The harpoons and
lances lie levelled for use;(1633,8)arsmen are just set(1970,10)ast in
its hole; while from a sudden roll(734,9)ea, the little craft stands
half-erect ou(422,9)water, like a rearing horse. From(823,11)the
smok(1113,8) torment(977,9)boiling whale is going up like the smoke
over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up
with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicke(599,9)ivity of the
excited seamen.


CHAPTER 57. Of W(499,9)Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in
Stone; in Mountains; in Stars.

On Tower-hill, as you go down(1964,8)London docks, you may have seen a
crippled beggar (or _kedger_, as the sailors say) holding a painted
board(1782,8)him, re(1156,15)tragic scene in which he lost his
leg. T(1757,10)hree(814,8)and three boats; and(1217,11) boats
(presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is
being crunched by the jaw(1658,9)foremost whale. Any time these ten
years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited
that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification
has now come. His(349,15)re as good(368,9)s were ever
published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a
(26,9)any you will find(1838,8)western clearings. But, though for
ever mounted on (287,10), never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman
make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own
amputation.

Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag
Harbor,(290,10)come across lively sketches of(800,11)
whaling-scenes, graven(703,8)(2046,9) themselves on Sperm
Whale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrough(1528,13)(1925,11)-bone, and
other like skrimshander articles(1104,9)whalemen call the numerous
little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve(1682,12)rough
material, in their hours of ocean leisure. Som(1682,8)m hav(1791,8)
boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the
(263,12)ing busines(732,8)in general(1067,8)oil with their
jack-knives alone; and,(35,8)at almost omnipotent too(2003,10)ailor,
they will turn you out anything you please(306,8) way of a mariner’s
fancy.

Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man
to that condition(1561,10)God placed him, _i.e._ what is called
savagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I
myself am(37,9), owning no allegiance but(1881,8)King of the
Cannibals; and ready(1312,8)moment to rebel against him.

Now,(1736,12)peculiar characteristic(1657,9)savage in his domestic
hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian
war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and(906,9)ion of
carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.
For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that
miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has
cost steady years of(16,8)applic(1535,8)As(949,9)(340,9)(587,9)so(29,10)whit(918,8)-savage. With the
same marvellous(448,9), and(98,10)same single(254,16)of
his one poor (1088,8)fe, he will carve you(346,11)one sculpture, not
quite as workmanlike, but as close packed(547,8)maziness of design, as
the Greek(860,9)Achilles’s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and
suggestivenes(1608,10)prints of that fine old Dutch(112,10)lbert
Durer.

Wooden whales, or(1862,8)cut in profil(1621,13)small dark slabs of
the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the
forecastles of American whalers(1686,15)are done with much
accuracy.

At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass(249,8)hung
by the tail for knockers(1266,8)road-side door. When the porter is
sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales
are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some
old-fashioned church(257,16)sheet-iro(522,8)(1648,8)there for
weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all
intents and purposes so labelled with “_Hands off!_” you cannot examine
them closely enough to decide upon their merit.

In bony, ribby region(1610,9)earth, where at the base of high broken
cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings(145,9) plain,
(637,9)often discover images a(1763,9)petrified form(1786,8)
Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks(1910,8)
them in a surf of green surges.

Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is
continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here an(627,9)rom
some lucky point of view(958,10)catch passing glimpse(296,9)profiles of(1239,8)defined along the undulating ridges. But you must be
a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you
wish to return to such a sight(362,8)(122,11) su(278,8)ake the
exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point,
else so chance-like are such observat(802,12)hills, that your
precise, previous(97,12) would require a laborious re-(751,8)y;
like the Soloma Island(704,9)still remain incognita, though once
high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.

Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out
great(1853,8)in the starry heavens, and boats in pursui(1878,8)m; as
when long fi(1296,10)thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies
locked in battle am(748,8)clouds. Thus(1257,8)North have I chased(1121,11)round and round the Pole(154,8)e revolu(558,13)bright
points that first(894,9)him to me. And beneath the effulgent
Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase
against(398,12)Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and
the Flying Fish.

With a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for
spurs, would I could mount th(591,8) and leap the topmost skies, to
see whether the fabled(630,8) with all their countless tents really
lie encamped(281,8)my mortal sight!


CHAPTER 58. Brit.

Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows
of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale
largely feeds. For leagues(323,8)gues it(1524,8)e(726,8)us, so that
we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden
wheat.

On the second day, numbers of(188,12)s were seen, who, secu(1800,8)the attack of a Sperm Whaler (1348,9)Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly
swam(200,9)the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibr(1877,8)at
wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated
(543,9)water that escaped(1178,8)lip.

As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
scythes(256,13)long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these
monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound;(960,8)ving
behind them endless swaths of blue upon the(765,9)ea.*

*That par(1587,8) sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does
not bear that name(46,8)Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
being shallows and soundings there, but(57,14)is remarkable
meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
floating in those latitudes, where(1061,16) is often chased.

But it was only the s(1773,8)y mad(292,8)y parted(828,9) which at
all reminded one of mowers. Seen(1295,10)mast-heads, especially when
they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms
looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in
the great hunting countries of India, the(767,8)r at a distance will
sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them
to be such, tak(24,8) for bare, blackened elevations(807,9)oil;
even so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species
of the leviatha(101,11)ea. And even when recognised at last, their
immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such
bulky(466,11)overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with
the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.

Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatu(1611,9)e
deep with (135,9)feelings that you do tho(1151,9) shore. For though
some old naturalists have maintained that all(134,17) land are
of their k(1743,10) sea; and though(640,8)a broad general view(215,8)thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialti(1202,9), for
example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to
the sagacious kindnes(795,9)dog? The accursed shark alone can in any
generic(487,8) be said to bear comparative analogy to him.

But though, to landsmen in(319,8), the native inhabitant(862,12)s
have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
repelling;(459,8)we know(1868,9)to be an everlasting terra incognita,
so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his
one superficial western one(161,8), by vast odds, the most terrific of
all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen
tens and hundreds of thousan(13,9)se who have gone upon the waters;
though but a moment’s consideration will teach, that however baby man
may brag of his science and skill, and(56,9)much, in a flattering
future, that(66,18) may augment; yet for ever and(13,9),
to the crack of doom,(561,9)will insult and murder him, and pulverize
the stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the
continual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sens(1254,8) full awful(1041,12)sea which aboriginally belongs to it.

T(1835,9)boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
That sam(1315,8)rolls now; t(27,15)destroyed the wrecked ships
of last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah’s flood is not yet subsided;
two thir(835,8)e fair world it yet covers.

Wherein differ(1160,9)and(1689,9), that a miracle upon one(127,8)a
(26,13)the other? Preternatural terrors rested(956,10)Hebrews,
when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and
swallowed them up(860,9); yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
precisely the same manner(120,10)sea swallows up ships and crews.

But not only is(1510,9)such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it
is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who
murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath
spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her
own cubs, so(1790,9)dashes even the mightiest whales against the
rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of
ships. No mercy, no power but(355,9)controls it. Panting and snorting
like a mad battle steed that(1281,10)its rider, the masterless ocean
overruns the globe.

Consi(785,8)subtle(1325,15); how its most dreaded(452,10)
glide under water, unapparent for(2006,10)part, and treacherously
hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. (179,9)also the devilish
brillia(1867,8)beauty of many of(199,10)remorseless tribes, as the
dainty embellished shape(72,9)species of sharks(148,10), once
more, the universal cannibalism(350,13)all whos(791,12)prey
upon each other, carrying on eternal war since th(1618,8)began(476,12)all this;(1400,8)n turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
earth; c(555,11)m both,(1488,21); and do you not find a
strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
surrounds the verdant land, so(1043,8)soul of man there lies one
insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the
horror(1790,9)half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that
isle, thou canst never return!


CHAPTER 59. Squid.

Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her
way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling
her keel, so that(383,9)urrounding serenity her three tall tapering
masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a
plain. And still, at wide intervals(539,9)ilvery night, the lonely,
alluring jet would be seen.

But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
spread ov(1397,8)ea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when
the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid
across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered
together as they softly ran on; in this profound hush(1636,8)visible
sphere a (1065,8)spectre was seen by Daggoo(839,8)e main-mast-head.

In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
higher, and disentangling itsel(969,9)e azure, at last gleamed before
our prow like a snow-slide, new slid(206,10)hills. Thus glistening
for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,
and silently(166,8). It(545,8)not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?
thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing(1826,12)with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod,
the negro yelled out—“There! there again(13,8)she breaches! right
ahead! The White Whale, t(17,14)!”

Upon this(1784,9)men rush(1203,8)e yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
bees rush(52,8)boughs. Bare-headed(1353,10)ltry sun, Ahab stood on
the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave
his orders(194,8)helmsman, cast his eager glance(1890,8)direction
indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of(575,8)

Whether the flitting attendance(1894,8)one still and solitary jet had
gradually worked upon Ahab(1693,10)he was now prepared to connect the
ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight(1221,8)particular
whale he pursued;(1502,9)this was, or whether(353,10)ness betrayed
him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly
perceive the(1279,11), than(892,8)quick intensity he instantly gave
orders for lowering.

The four boats were soon(1662,13); Ahab’s in advance, and all
swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it(1107,12)and while, with
oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo!(865,9)ame spot
where it sank,(1344,11)it(1392,8)rose. Almost forgetting for the
moment all thoughts of(1341,10), we now gazed at the most wondrous
phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A
vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing
cream-colour, lay floating(479,13), innumerable long arms
radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting(1824,8)nest of
anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.
No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of
either sensation or instinct; but undulated there(769,8)billows, an
unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.

As(1825,8)low sucking sound(661,11)disappeared again, Starbuck still
gazing(623,8)agitated waters (760,9)had sunk(1943,9)wild voice
exclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen(743,10) and fought him, than to
have seen thee, thou white ghost!”

“What was it, Sir?” said Flask.

“The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,
and return(1979,9)ir ports to tell of it.”

But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back(2015,8)vessel;
the rest as silently following.

Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have(1731,8)ed
(1700,9)(1694,11)i(797,8), certain it is, that a glimpse of it
being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
portentousness. So rarely is it(396,8) that though one(1568,8) of them
declare it to be the largest animated thing(1494,8)ocean, yet very few
of them have any bu(1408,11)vague ideas concern(1596,8)true nature
and form; notwithstanding, they believ(172,8)furnish(521,8)sperm
whale his only food. For(259,9)ther species of whales find their food
abov(1416,9)and may be seen by man(1765,8)act of fee(171,9)
spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the
surface; and only by inference is it that any one can(860,9)what,
precisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will
disgorge what are supposed(564,11)detached arms of the squid; some(547,9)thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet(1876,10). They
fancy(728,8)e monster to(2003,10)se arms belonged ordinarily clings
by them(1095,8)bed(180,8)ocean; and(101,10)(1058,11), unlike other
species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.

There seems some ground to imagine(236,10)great Kraken of Bishop
Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in
(316,9) Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with
some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But
much abatement is necessary with respect(1543,8)incredible bulk he
assigns it.

By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumor(706,9)mysterious
creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of
cuttle-fish,(683,9), indeed, in(1597,9)external(226,8)s it would
seem to belong, but only as the Anak(890,8)tribe.


CHAPTER 60. The Line.

With re(1103,8)to the whaling scene shortly to be(529,9)d, as well as
for the better under(1463,8) of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,
I have here to spe(204,10)magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.

The line originally used(1722,8)fishery wa(1186,9)best hemp, slightly
vapor(967,9)ar, not impregnat(993,8)it, as(1814,8)case of(1131,8)y
ropes; for while tar, as(1165,12)used, makes the hemp more pliable
to the rope-mak(1679,8)also renders(33,9)(998,8)more convenient to
the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the(206,10)quantity too much stiffen(568,9)e-line (529,8)close coiling(1438,9)
it must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in
general by no means adds(1489,8)rope’s durability or strength, however
much it may give it compactness and gloss.

Of late years the Manilla rope h(524,10)American(625,9)almost
entirely superseded hemp as a material for(728,11)s; for, though not
so durable as hemp(1156,8)strong(550,8)far more soft and elastic; and
I will add (since there is an æsthetics(1457,11)ngs), is much more
handsome and becoming(1879,9)oat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark
fellow, a sort of Indian; but(358,9)is as a golden-haired Circassian
to behold.

T(662,14)is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first
sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment
its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
to three tons. In length, the(1047,9)perm(980,12)measures
something over two(164,9)fathoms. Towards the stern(1387,9)oat it is
spirally coiled away(1445,8)tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still
though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely
bedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any
hollow but the “heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of
the cheese. As the least tangle or kink(1646,9)oiling would, in
running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,
the utmost precaution is(1863,9)stowing t(1899,8)in its tub. Some
harpooneers will consume almost an(119,8)morning in this business,
carry(103,13)high al(1224,8)then reeving it down(631,8)rough a
block t(655,11)tub, so(1974,11)act of(1703,12)free it from all
possible wrinkles and twists.

In the English boats two tubs are(315,8)stead of one; the same line
being continuous(794,10)in both tubs. T(1440,8)some advantage in
this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into
(1463,10)and do not(1099,8)it so much; whereas,(1777,14)tub,
nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a
rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in
(1493,9); for the bottom(1171,8)whale-boat is like critical ice, which
(1366,10)up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a
(1105,8)ated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the
(360,9)line-tub,(1370,10)looks as if it were pulling off with a
prodigious great wedding-cake to present(1987,8)whales.

Both ends(1488,8)line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
eye-splice or loop coming up from(419,12)against the side of the
tub, and hang(1675,9)its edge completely disengaged from everything.
This arrangement(213,9)(191,9)is necessary on two accounts. First:
In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a
neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to
threaten to carry off the(1515,8)line originally attached to th(1470,9). In these instances,(819,10) of course is shifted like a mug
of ale, as(652,8),(481,10)one boa(611,9)other; though the first
boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This
(478,12)is indispensable for common safety’s sake; for were the
(718,10)(757,12)in any wa(320,17)(1339,11)(68,9)whale then to run(1853,10)ou(872,9)end(1826,8)in a single, smoking
minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there,(1271,9)doomed
boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of
the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.

Before lower(2026,8)boat(1450,9)chase, the upp(390,20)s
taken aft(1086,10)(1055,9)passing round the loggerhead(287,8)is
again carried forward(818,13)ength(1586,8)boat, resting crosswise
upon the loom or handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs(1258,9)his
wrist in rowing; and also(208,9)between the men, as they alternately
sit at the opposite gunwales,(1499,8)leaded chocks or grooves in the
extreme pointed prow(264,14)where a wooden pin or skewer the size
of a(877,8)quill, prevents it from slipping out. F(1548,8)chocks it
hangs in a slight festoon ove(2012,8)ws, and is then passed inside the
boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being
coiled (498,9)box i(11,8)ws, it continues its way(1871,8)gunwale
still a little further aft(194,14)(1120,16)short-warp—the
rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to
that connexion,(105,15) goes through sundry mystifications too
tedious to detail.

Thus(1591,10)-line fold(21,8)ole boat in its complicated coils,
twisting and writhing around it in(1336,8)every direction. All the
oarsmen are involved(114,8)perilous contortions;(931,9)to the timid
eye(1543,9)andsman, they seem as Indian jugglers,(380,10)deadliest
snakes sportively(713,8)ing their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal
woman(1502,10)first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,
and while straining his utmos(1089,10)ar, bethink him that at any
unknown instant(616,12) may be darted, and all these horrible
(376,11) be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus
circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones
to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what
cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jok(414,8)brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you
will hear(1319,10)half-inch white cedar(1882,8)whale-(1502,9)n thus
hung in hangman’s nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before
King Edward,(47,9)men composing the crew pull into the jaws of
death, with a halter(1035,8)every neck, as you may say.

Perhaps a very(1398,8)thought will now enable you to account for those
repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of
this man o(667,9)n being taken out(1898,12) by the line, and lost.
For(423,9)e line is darting out, to be seated then(1708,10)at, is
like being(39,8)in the mids(135,9)manifold whizzings of a
steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and sh(1771,8)
wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you(1015,8)sit motionless in
the hear(311,8)se perils, because(333,10)is rocking(991,8)cradle,
and you are pitched one way and the other,(1124,9)the slightest
warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and
simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escap(442,8)made a
Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun(1584,9)could
never pierce you out.

Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
prophesies(1861,8)storm, is perhaps more awful than(38,10) itself;
for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelop(1974,9)storm; and
contains it in itself,(221,8)seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
powder,(541,9)ball(14,10)explosion; so the graceful repos(153,8)
line, as it silently serpentines ab(620,8)oarsmen befor(952,8)brought
into actual play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than
any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men
live(387,9)d in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their
necks; but it is only when caught(1231,8)swift, sudden turn of death,
that mortals realiz(1713,8)lent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.
And if you be a philosopher, though(1346,15)(1870,12)you would
not at heart feel one whit(402,10)error,(774,8)(91,12)before
your evening fire(1814,8)pok(658,8)not a harpoon, by your side.


CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.

If to Starbuck the apparition(1697,8)Squid wa(614,10)of portents, to
Queequeg it was quite a different object.

“When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his(227,8) in the
bow of his hoisted boat, “t(94,8)quick(100,10)parm whale.”

The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special
to engage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resist the spell of
sleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this p(1792,10) Indian Ocean
through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively
ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,
flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than
those off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.

It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head;(483,10)my shoulders
leaning again(442,8)lackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed
in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in
that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of
my body;(1232,8)my bod(758,8)continued to sway as a pendulum will,
long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.

Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the
seamen(453,8)main and mizzen-(465,9)s were already drowsy. So that
(289,8)all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every
swing that we made there was a nod from below(76,11)lumbering
helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the
wide trance(1461,8)sea, east(74,9)o west, and the sun over all.

Suddenly bubbles(687,8)bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
hands grasped the(801,8); some invisible, gracious agency preserved
me;(1774,8)shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not
forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling(2011,9)ater like
the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian
hue, glisten(106,11)sun’s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating
in the trough(496,13)and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his
vapory jet, the whale looked(134,8)portly burgher smok(1936,8)pipe of
a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck
by some(1305,9)r’s wand, the sleepy ship(227,9)y sleeper in it all
at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from
all parts(1899,8)vessel, simultaneously with the three not(66,10)oft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and
regular(443,8)(847,8)parkling brine into the air.

“Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obey(468,8)own order, he
dashed the helm down before(21,9)sma(1711,8)handle the spokes.

The sudden exclamation(342,9)crew must have alarmed(654,10); and
ere(200,10) were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the
leeward, but with such a steady(804,10)ity, and making so few ripples
as(95,8),(1681,8)inki(1804,9)all he might not as yet b(221,9),
Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak
but in whispers. So seat(957,8)Ontario Indians on the gunwale(729,8)
boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of
the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,
the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet(770,13),
and then sank out of sight(1374,8)tower swallowed up.

“There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
Stubb’s produc(1328,8)match and igni(1414,8) pipe, for now a respite
was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the
whale rose again, and being now in advance(1605,9)moker’s boat, and
much nearer to it than to any(1661,8)others, Stubb counted upon the
honor(1015,9)apture. It was obvious, now(856,9)(1681,8)had at length
become aware(255,8)pursuers. All silence of cautiousness(459,8)refore
no longer of use. Paddle(1120,8)ropp(892,8)oars came loudly into play.
And still puffing at(472,11)Stubb cheered on his crew(1177,8)assault.

Yes, a mighty change had come ov(513,8)ish. All alive to his jeopardy,
he was going “head out”; that part obliquely projecting from the mad
yeast which he brewed.*

*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the
entire interi(538,10)sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though
apparently the most massive, it is by far(31,10)buoyant part about
him. So that with ease he elevates it in(1119,9) and invariably does
so when go(516,11)utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth(1422,8)upper part(1827,8)front(1001,8)head, and such the tapering cut-water
formation(1895,8)lower part, that by(516,11)eleva(1168,9)head, he
thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish
galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.

“Start her, s(11,10)my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of
time—but(67,10);(78,10) like thunder-claps, that’s all,” cried
Stubb, spluttering out(1318,10) as he spoke. (185,12)now; give ’em
the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. (248,11)Tash, my boy—start
her, all; but keep cool,(11,10)—cucumbers(604,8)word—easy,
easy—only(262,16)grim death and grinning devils, and raise the
buried dead(1951,14)(1893,8)their graves, boys—(345,10). S(204,8)!”

“Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old
war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman(962,8)strained boat
involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leadi(453,9)
which the eager Indian gave.

But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee!
(9,8)” yelled Daggoo, straining(182,8)s and backwards(1653,8)seat,
like a pacing tiger in his cage.

“Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smack(1078,8)lips over a
mouthful of Grenadier’s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels
c(874,8)ea. Meanwhil(1874,9)retain(1204,8)place(1443,8)van, still
encouraged his men(549,8)onset, all the while(1986,9)(993,10)from
his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they(611,9), till the
welcome cry was heard—“Stand up(1032,10)!—give it to him!” The harpoon
was hurled. “Stern all!” The oarsmen backed water; the same moment
something went hot and hissing along(827,8)ne(981,10)wrists. It was
the magical line. An instant befor(429,9)had swiftly caught two
additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its
increased rapid circlings, a hempen blu(1461,8)now jetted up and
mingle(1007,11)steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round
and(186,21); so also, jus(284,8) reaching that point, it
blisteringly(97,8)through an(12,10)both of Stubb’s hands, from(1169,11)hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at
these times, had accidentally dropped(528,8) like holding an enemy’s
sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy(918,9)time
striving to wrest it(1646,8)your clutch.

“Wet(412,9)! w(14,12)” cried Stubb(1578,8)tub(1566,9)(him
seate(157,9)tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into
it.* More(726,8)ere taken, so tha(166,10) began(311,9)its place.
The boat now flew(517,9)the boiling wat(1993,8)a shark all fins.
Stubb and(1117,9) here changed places—stem for stern—a staggering
business truly in that rocking commotion.

*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be
stated, that,(1967,8)old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the
running line with(1285,8)in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or
bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most
convenient.

From the vibrat(160,9)extend(1649,8)entire length of the upper part
of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you
would have thought the craft had two keels—one cleav(1811,8)water, the
other the air—as(155,9) churned on(1194,15)pposing elements at
once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy
in her wake; and,(57,8)slightest motion from within, even but of a
little finger,(433,14), cracking craft canted over her spasmodic
gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main
clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed(1231,8)foam; and the tall
form of(1025,10)(280,8)teering oar crouching almost double, in order
to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics
seemed(1841,8)as they shot on their way, till at(776,8)the whale
somewhat slackened his flight.

“Haul in—haul in(1523,22)bowsman! and, facing round
towards(115,10), all hands began pull(944,8)boat up to him, while
ye(690,8)at was(425,9)wed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb,
firmly planting his knee(1301,8)clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart
(641,9)flying fish;(850,8)word of command,(961,10)alternately
sterning(1904,8)the way(11,9)hale’s horrible wallow(2000,8)en
(233,11)for another fling.

The red tide now poured from all sides(1293,8)mons(1775,9)brooks down
a hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which
bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind i(685,10)ke. The s(422,8)sun
playing upon this crimson po(63,9) sea, sent back its reflection
into every face, so that they all glowed to each oth(279,8)red men.
And all the while, je(544,8)jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot
f(1722,8)spiracle(506,13), and vehement puff after puff (61,8)
mou(1746,10)excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his
crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again
and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and
again sent it(1513,10)whale.

“Pull up—pull up!” he now cri(1455,10)bowsman, as the waning whale
relaxed in his wrath. (90,8)!—close to!”(1521,9)boat ranged along
the fish’s flank. When reaching far over(1892,8)(314,9)lowly(1995,8)
his long sharp lanc(1759,11)fish, and kept it there, carefully
churning and (13,8), as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold
watch(779,9) whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of
breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was
the innermost lif(796,9)fish. And now it is struck; for, starting
from his tr(340,12)at unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the
(1302,8)horribly (261,8)(572,8)blood, overwrapped himself in
impenetrable, mad, boiling spray(1150,13) imperilled craft,
instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from
that phrensied twiligh(859,11)clear air(1670,8)day.

(357,8)abating(814,8)flurry,(549,11)once more(1553,8)out into
view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilat(715,9)ontracting
his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last,
gush after gush of clotted red gore(824,8)it had been the purple lees
of red wine, sho(1189,11)frighted air; and falling back(1307,8)ran
dripping down his motionless flanks(1276,10)sea. His heart had burst!

“He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.

“Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own (834,9)mouth,
Stubb scattered the dead ashes(1261,10)water; and, for a moment, stood
thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.


CHAPTER 62. The Dart.

A word conce(1285,8) incident in the last chapter.

According(1579,8)invariable usag(1131,13)e(746,13)-boat pushes
o(1926,11) ship, with the(1920,9) or whale-killer as temporary
steersman,(1639,9)harpooneer(59,10)fastener pull(300,8)foremost
oar, the one known(1779,8)(76,10)-oar. Now it needs a strong,
nervous arm to strike the first iron(1681,14); for often, in what
is(1350,8)a long dart,(270,8)vy implement has to be flu(392,9)
distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting
the chase,(339,16)is expected to pull his oar meanwhile(143,8)uttermost; indeed, he(67,16)set an example of superhuman
activity(617,8)rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated
loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the
top of one’s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half
started—what that is n(636,8) but those who have tried it. For one, I
cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one(810,9)same
time. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back(630,8)fish, all at once the(591,8)ed(914,12)hears the exciting
cry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now(758,8)drop and secure his
oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his(1064,8)(1153,9)
crotch,(1484,9) what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it
somehow(1747,10)whale. No wonder, tak(1458,8)whole fleet of whalemen
in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are
successful; n(125,8) that so many haples(269,9)eers are madly cursed
and disrated(74,19)m(1519,8)m actually burst their
blood-vessels(1618,8)boat(76,22)sperm(264,9) are
absent four years with four barrels(226,17)to many ship
owners, whaling is but a losing(1790,8); for(1030,8)(1611,14)that
makes the voyage, and if you take the breath(433,8)his body how can
you expect to find it there when most wanted!

Again, if the dart be (475,10), then at the second critical instant,
that is, when(1935,10) starts to run,(411,9)header an(958,12)
likewise start to running fore and aft,(1453,8)imminent jeopardy of
themselves and every one else. I(381,8)n they change places;(2021,8)
headsman, the chief officer of the(953,8)craft, takes his proper
station(656,10)ws(58,8)boat.

Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both
foolish and unnecessary. The (194,8) should stay(141,13)from
first to last; he(47,8)both dart(1953,12)(1498,9)lance, and no
rowing whatever(67,9)e(1995,10)of him, except under circumstances
obvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a
slight loss of speed(1043,8)chase; but long experience in various
(1049,9)of more than one nation has convinced me that(1143,8)vast
majority of failure(1176,9)fishery, it has not by any means been so
much the speed(629,8)whale as the before described(1811,8)ion of the
(1122,15) has caused them.

To insure the greatest efficienc(565,9)dart,(1207,15)s of this
world must(957,10)their feet from(1635,8)idleness(576,8)(30,10)
of toil.


CHAPTER 63. The Crotch.

Out(899,8)trunk, the branches grow;(1742,8)them, the twigs. So, in
productive subjects, grow(553,8)pters.

The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.
It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,
which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the
bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest(37,9)wooden extremit(1380,8)(2002,8), whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the
prow. Thereby the weapon is(1625,8)ly at hand to its hurler, who
snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his
rifle(149,9) wall(1575,8)customary to have two(1974,8)s reposing in
t(553,9), respectively called the first and(1863,8)irons.

But thes(96,14), each by its own cord, are both connected with
the line; the object being this: to(1490,9)m both, if possible, one
(376,11)fter th(476,8)(607,10)ame whale; so that if, in the
coming drag, on(1618,9)draw out,(84,11)may still retain a hold. It
is a doubling(1909,8)chances. But it very often happens that owing to
the(588,8)aneous, violent, convulsive runn(103,11)whale upon
receiving(451,11)iron, it becomes im(326,8)(861,9)(1402,10),
however lightning-like in his movements, to pit(1529,8)(549,10) into
him. Nevertheless,(1546,8)(43,13)s already(545,15) the
line,(1992,10)ine is(255,8), hence that(908,8)must, at all events,
be anticipatingly tossed(1400,11) boat, somehow and somewhere; else
the most terrible jeopardy would(2008,10)ll hands. Tumbl(1261,11)
water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line
(mentioned in a preceding(1547,8)) mak(841,8) feat, in most instances,
prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended
(428,8) saddest and most fatal casualties.

Furthermore: you must know that when(547,20)thrown
overboard, it thenceforth(731,9)a dangling, sharp-edged terror,
skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangl(850,8)lines,
or cutting them, and(373,8)a prodigious sensation in all directions.
Nor, in general, is it(1251,9) to secure it again until(1013,11)is
fairly captured and a corpse.

Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
one unusually strong, active, and knowing(1386,8)when(1239,9) these
qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loos(1176,13)s may be
simultaneously(563,9) about him. For, of course(1757,8)oat is
suppli(1193,8)several(1898,10)to bend on(215,8)li(1626,10)(1884,9)
one be ineffectually dar(1828,8)out recovery. All these particulars are
faithfully narrated here(1393,8)y will not fail to elucidate(190,8)
most important, (1542,8)intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be
painted.


CHAPTER 64. Stubb’s Supper.

(17,8)whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a
calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow
business of tow(1846,8)trophy(658,8)Pequod. And now, as we eighteen
men with our thirty-six arms, and one hund(925,8)eighty thumbs and
fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse
i(1341,8)a; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long
intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished(1851,8)enormousness of
the mass we moved. For,(191,8)e great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever
they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will
draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this
grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if lad(531,8)pig-lead
in bulk.

Darkness came on(107,8)ree lights up and down(1440,8)Pequod’s
main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
dropping one of(1215,9)more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly
eye(1808,8)heav(1527,9) for a moment, he issued the usual orders for
securing it for the night, and then handing his(155,8) to a seaman,
went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward(1868,12)
morning.

Though, in overse(230,9)pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had
evinced his customary activity, to(723,8) so; yet now that the
creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or
despair,(1015,8)working in him; as if the sight of that dead body
reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a(1983,9)
other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot
advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought
(1597,10)ound(1065,8)(848,8) decks, that all hands were preparing to
cast anchor(916,8)deep; for heavy chains are being drag(1054,9) the
deck(734,8)rust rattling out(1359,8)port-holes. But by those clanking
links, the vast corpse itself, not(1839,9), is to be moored. Tied by
the head(1769,8)stern, and by the tail(1799,8)bows, the whale now lies
with its black hull close(1857,8)vessel’s and seen through the darkness
of(1026,12)which obscur(1971,8)pars and (1280,8)aloft, the two—ship
and(927,8)seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one
reclines while the other remains standing.*

*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
reliable hold which(450,9) has(1851,10)whale when moor(1660,8)side,
is(442,8)flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is
relatively heavier than any other (except(1541,8)side-fins), its
flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;
so that with the hand you cannot get at it (997,9)boat, in order to
put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a
small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,
and a weight in its middle,(618,17)end is secure(932,10)hip.
By adroit management the(128,14)is made to rise(1275,8)other side(883,8)mass, (367,8)now having girdled(1014,10),(331,11)is readily
(103,8)follow suit; and being slipp(1288,12) body, is at last
locked fast round the smallest par(1311,9)tail, at the point of
junction (1167,10)road(777,11)lobes.

If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known
on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flush(540,8)conquest, betrayed an
unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was
he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned
to him for the time the sole(618,12)of affairs. One small, helping
cause of all this liveliness in(304,8)was soon made strangely
manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of
(1707,10)as a flavorish thing to his palate.

“A steak, a(9,8)ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut
me one from his small!”

Here be it known,(432,8)(1802,8)se wild fishermen do not, as a general
thing, and according(1986,8)great military maxim, make the enemy defray
the current expenses(867,8)war ((770,9)before realiz(1523,8)proceed(1975,9)voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers
who have a genuine relish for(1693,10)icular(1038,13)Sperm Whale
designated by Stubb; compris(1707,8)tapering extremity(1112,8)body.

About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up(647,8)spermaceti supper
at the capstan-head, as if that(25,8) were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb
the only banqueter on whale’s flesh that night. Mingling their
mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on(13,12)f sharks,
swarming(1501,11)dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.
The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp
slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inch(804,9)
(132,8)’ hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as
before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and
turn(116,9)o(264,9)acks as they scooped out huge globular pieces(1325,14)(782,8)igness of a human head. This(909,12)fea(1947,8)
shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable
surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains
a(1066,13)universal problem(1699,11)ngs. The mark they thus leave
on (1613,9), may best be likened(1408,8)hollow made by a carpenter in
countersinking for a screw.

Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks
will be seen longingly gazing up(1579,8)ship’s decks, like hungry dogs
round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every
killed man that is toss(306,9)m; and though, while the valiant
butchers(853,10)deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other’s
live meat with(36,8)-knives all gilded and tasselled,(1075,9)ks,
also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsome(145,11)away
under the table at(1291,10)meat(271,15)ere you to turn the
whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing,
(400,10) say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties;
(445,10) sharks also are the invariable outriders(886,8)slave ships
cros(1954,9)Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy
in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be
decently buri(2015,8)though one or two other like instances might be
set down, touch(215,8)set terms, places, and occasions, when(327,8)do
most socially congregate, and most hilarious(1844,8); yet is there no
conceivable time or(116,9) when you will find them in such countless
numb(1653,8) in gayer or more jovial spirits, than a(1092,8)dead sperm
(1347,8)oored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen
that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of
devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliat(661,8)devil.

But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings(1866,9)anquet that was
going on so nigh him, no more than(1145,11)(95,8)the smacking of
his own epicurean lips.

“Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening his
legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;
and,(1253,8)same time darting his fork into the dish(103,8)stabbing
with his lance; “cook, you cook!—sail this way, cook!”

The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came
shambl(1203,9)(72,10)galley, for, like many(174,10)s, there was
somet(1096,9)matter (277,9)knee-pans, which he did not keep well
scoured like his other pans; this(542,11), as they called him(209,9)uffling and limp(1424,9), assis(473,9)step(166,10)tong(162,8),
after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoop(175,11)
Ebony floundered(137,9)nd in obedience to the word of command, came
to(1547,9)top on the opposite side of Stubb’s sideboard; when, with
both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he
bowed his arched back(900,14) over(851,19)sideways
incli(965,8) head, so as to br(887,8)best ear into play(1083,9)” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
mouth, “don’t you think this steak is(67,8)overdone? You’ve been
be(1399,8)(51,9)too much, cook; it’s too tender. Don’t I always say
that to be good,(1634,8)-steak must be tough? There are thos(1405,8)
now over the side, (218,10)see they prefer it tough and rare? What a
shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to ’em; tell ’em(56,9)
welcome to help themselves civilly(1953,9)moderation, but they must
keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. A(1367,9), and

hand he solemnly flourished(1330,12)and leaning far(654,14) in
a mumbling voice began address(1590,8)sharks, while(988,8)softly
crawling behind, overheard all that was said.

“Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam
noise dare. You hear? S(35,11) smackin’ ob de lip! Massa Stubb say

on the shoulder,—“Cook! why, damn your eyes,(308,9)n’t swear(389,8)y
when you’re preaching. That’s no way to convert sinners, cook!”

“Who dat? Den(873,11)him yourself,” s(881,9)urning to go.

“No(1415,8)go on, go on.”

“Well, den, Belubed f(557,15)”—

“Right!” exclaim(335,11)pprovingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,” and
Fleece continued.

“Do you is all(758,9)and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,

to ’em gentlemanly.”

Once more the sermon proceeded.

“Your(258,14),(478,16), I don’t blame ye so much for; dat

“Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
Fleece, and I’ll away to my supper.”

Upon this, (49,8)holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
shrill voi(113,8)cried—

“Cuss(1994,18)! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill
your dam’(507,9)’till dey bust—and den die.”

“Now, cook,” sai(1777,9)resuming his supper at the capstan; “stand

attention.”

“All dention(155,8)(425,9)gain stooping over upon his tongs in the

cook?”

“What dat do wid de ’tea(407,9)the old black, testily.

“Silence! H(93,15) (93,9)’Bout ninety, dey say,” he gloomily muttered.

“And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,
and don’t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another
mouthful(637,8)last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
question. “Where w(687,8)born(299,12)Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat,(1540,8)ber de Roanoke.”

“Born in a(48,11)! That’s queer, too. But I want to know what
country you were born in, cook!”

“Didn’t I say(128,11) country?” he cried sharply.

“No, you didn’t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook. You
must go home and be born(990,11); you(504,12)(500,13)

“Bress(1479,10)if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily, turning
round to depart.

“Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take that bit of steak
there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be? Take
it, I say”—(1589,8)the tongs towards him—“take it, and taste it.”

Faintly smack(1433,8)withered lips over it for a moment,(1082,9)negro
(999,8), “Best(183,8)’teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”

“C(1581,18)squar(1345,12)once more; “do you belong to the

“Where do you expect to go(974,9)?”

“Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.

“Avast! heave to! I mean when you die(1084,8)It’s an awful (1419,9)

But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.

“Cook, give me cutlets for supper (304,9) night(1573,8)mid-watch.
D(357,10)away you sail, then.—Halloa! stop! make a bow before you
go.—Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast—don’t forget.”

“Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if
he ain’t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttere(1160,10)man,
limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.


CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.

That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
like Stubb,(306,8) by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
philosophy of it.

It is upon record, tha(741,8)centuries ago the tongue of the Right
Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large
prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the
court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be
eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of
whale. P(56,10)indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The
meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being
well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turt(1047,9)or veal balls.
T(904,8)onks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They ha(533,9)
(329,8) grant from the crown.

The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
hands be(348,12)a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but
(1990,11)me to sit down(1376,8)a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
long, it takes(1479,9)r appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men(1094,13)nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are
not so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare
old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, on(1072,8)ir most famous
doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly
juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that(1081,9)Englishmen, who
long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that
these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scrap(1081,10)s which had been left ashore after trying (1032,8)blubber. Among
the Dutch whalemen these(105,8)are called “fritters”;(1244,8)indeed,
they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something
like old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.
They have such an eatable look(1718,8)e most self-denying stranger can
hardly keep his hands off.

But what further depreciates(1128,11)as a civilized dish, is his
(664,9) richness. He is the great prize ox(1862,8)sea, too fat to be
delicately good. Look at his hump, which(1268,8)e as(1595,12) as the
buffalo’s (which i(1957,13)rare dish), were it not such a solid
pyramid of fat. B(1655,8)permaceti itself, how bland and creamy that
is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the
third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
butter. Nevertheless, many(813,10)have a method of absorbing it into
some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches
of the night it is a common thing for(556,8)men to dip their
ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many
a good supper have I thus made.

In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine
dish. The casket(772,9)kull is broken into with an ax(342,10) two
pl(771,8)tish lobe(1561,8)withdrawn (precise(1208,10)ing two large
puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and(1891,8)into a most
delectable mess, in flavor somewhat(123,12)calves’ head(960,8)is
quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young
bucks among th(62,10), by continually dining upon(146,9)brains, by
and by get to(772,8)littl(473,9)(1997,9)own, so as to be able to
tell a calf’s head from(55,10) heads(1645,16) requires
uncommon discrimination(2006,8)at(1362,8)reason why a young buck with
an intelligent looking(151,13)before him, is somehow one of the
saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at
him,(720,9)“Et tu Brute!” expression.

It is not, perhaps, entirely because(1676,11)is so excessively
unctuous that landsmen seem to regard th(1579,9)of him with
abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way,(471,9) consideration
before mentioned: _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing(1303,8)sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man
that ever(97,10)an ox was regarded as a(130,8)r;(382,8) he was
hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would
have been; and(34,14)deserved it if an(272,9)r does. Go to the
meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds
staring up at(1686,10)rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight
take a tooth ou(1485,9)cannibal’s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a
(40,8)? I tell you it will be more tolerable(1796,9)Fejee that
salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it
(114,29)at provident Fejee, I say, in the day of
judgment, than(1972,8)e, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who
nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy
paté-de-foie-gras.

But Stubb, he eats(1095,11)(847,16), does he? a(1394,10)
adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my
(269,34)(1700,8)off that roast beef, what is
that handle made of?—what but the bone(1710,8) brother(675,8)very ox
you ar(1292,8)? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring
that fat goose? With a fea(116,12)same fowl. And with what quill
did the Secretary(847,8)Society(768,9)Sup(1585,8) of Cruelty to
Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month
or two tha(1008,8)ociety passed a resolution to patronize nothing but
steel pens.


CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.

When(849,8)Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale(395,8)long and
weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, i(1903,10)as a general
thing at least, customary to proceed at onc(937,9)business of cutting
him in. F(1098,8)(37,9)is an exceedingly laborious one;(1319,8)very
soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the
common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send
every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation
that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept;(1160,8), two and
two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck
to see that all goes well.

But sometimes, especially upon the Line(1548,8)Pacific, this plan will
not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather
round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a
stretch, littl(1897,8)han the skeleton would be visible by morning. In
most other part(1388,9)ocean, however, where these fish do not so
largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably
diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a
procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to
tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the
present case(829,10)Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man
unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side th(1309,9)
would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and
those(714,8)the maggots in it.

Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the(1050,13) after his supper was
conclud(1312,8)when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came
on deck, no small excitement was created among th(221,8); for
immediately suspend(196,8)cutting stages over the side, and lowering
three lanterns, s(1935,9)ey cast long gleams of light(83,10)turbid
sea, these two mariners, dar(347,8)ir long(785,17)kept up an
incessant murdering(1005,8)sharks,* by strik(433,8)keen steel deep
into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But(1368,8)foamy
confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not
always hit(68,8)ark(1765,8)is brough(1865,8)new revelation(1254,8)
incredible ferocity(1281,8)foe. They viciously snapped, not only at
each other’s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and
b(200,9)own; till those entrails seemed swallow(1014,8)an(9,8)gain
by the same mout(1117,9)oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was
this all. It was unsafe to meddl(1238,11)corpses and g(1782,9)these
creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality(233,8)to lurk in
their very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual
life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,
one(227,9)(2015,8)(1374,8)ook poor(1193,9)’s hand off, when he tried
to shut down the dead lid(111,8)murderous jaw.

*The(1781,14) used for(1177,8)-in is mad(164,8) very best steel;
is about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape,
corresponds to the garden implement(409,9)ich it is named; only its
sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than
the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible(1639,10)
being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a
stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.

“(1768,9)no care what god made him shark,” said the savage,
agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or
Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.”


CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.

It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio
professors of(46,9)breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was
turned into what(1376,8)a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would
have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen(818,8)sea gods.

In the first place, the enormous(991,8) tackles, among other ponderous
things comprising a cluster of blocks(973,8)ly painted green, and
which no single man can(820,8)y lift—this vast bunch of grapes was
swayed up(1053,8)main-top and firmly lashed(1087,8)lower mast-head, the
strongest point anywhere above a ship’s deck. The end(2014,8)hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted
to the windlass, and the hug(183,8)block(1392,8)tackles was swung over
the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one
hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the
side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed(2018,9)ir long spades,
began(657,9)a hole in the body(1850,9)insertion(1674,8)hook just
above the nearest(317,9)wo side-fins. This done, a broad,
semicircular line is cut rou(411,8)ole,(115,10)(1385,11)(447,9)
main body(1832,8)crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving
in one dense crowd at(561,13). When instantly(985,8)tire ship
careens over on her sid(1154,9)bolt in her starts like the nail-heads
of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her
frighted(908,10)(2019,9)sky. More and more she lea(190,8)to the
whale, while every gasping heave(811,8)(853,8) is answered by a
hel(47,11)from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap
is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from(955,10)(1021,10)triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it
the disengaged (713,13)(1209,10) first strip of(1046,8). Now as
the(1066,9)envelopes (1119,9) precisely as the rind does an orange,
so is it stripped off(361,11)ody(74,14)(60,9) is sometimes
(63,9)by spiralizing it. For the strain co(772,8) kept up by the
(520,9)continually keep(216,12)rolling over and over in the
water, and(246,8)(1357,8)in one strip uniformly peels off along the
line called the “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of(1364,9)
(1364,20); and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and
indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher
an(11,8) aloft till its upper end grazes(1960,13); the men at(418,14)then ceas(1284,9), and for a moment or two the prodigious
blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down(1018,10)sky, and
every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else
it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.

On(1213,9)attending harpooneers now advances(1142,8)long, keen weapon
called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices
out a considerable(1934,13)lower par(1887,9)sway(380,8). Into
this(1841,11)(1160,11)second alternating grea(1266,9)is then
hooked so as to retain a hold upon(913,12), in order to prepare for
what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands
to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash(1969,8)mass, and with a
few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in
twain; so that while the short(417,12)is still fast, the long upper
strip,(1180,8)a blanket-piece, swings clear, and(1053,8)ready for
lowering. The heavers forward now resume their so(985,8)(180,10)one
(507,10)peeling and hoisting a(565,8)strip(1976,10)wha(609,8)other
is slowly slackened away, and down goes(1808,17)through the
main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor(1506,11)
blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep
coiling away(440,10)(418,13) as if it were a great live mass of
plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles(386,9)
and (492,8)(1720,15); both whale and (1911,9)(1482,9)the
(540,8)sing(21,8)(1870,8)-room gentlemen coil(36,9)mates
scarf(56,9)ship strain(1579,9)(938,9) swearing occasionally, by
way of assuaging the general friction.


CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.

I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin
of(705,10). I have had controversies about it with experienced
whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion
remains unchanged; but it is only an(45,8).

The question is, what and wher(1466,8) skin(1742,8)whale? Already you
know what his(1471,8) is. That(17,11) something(1820,8)consistence
of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and
ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.

Now, however preposterous it may at(1136,8)eem to talk of any
creature’s skin as be(247,9)at sort of(256,12) and(131,10), yet
in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;
because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer(1430,9)
whale’s body but that sam(1965,9); and the outermost(80,17)
of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but(869,9)?
True,(1583,10)unmarred dead body(679,13), you may scrape off with
your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat
resembl(1135,8)thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as
flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it
not only contracts(581,10)ens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I
have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.
It is(317,12), as I said before; and being laid upon the printed
page,(1344,8)sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a
magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales
through their own spectacles, as(603,10)ay. But what I am driving at
(1351,10)(1296,9)same(628,18)(562,9)(626,12)which, I
admit, invests the entire(757,20)is not so much to be
regarded a(1492,18)(1199,8),(29,20)skin, so to
speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper(1606,8)
the tremendous whal(291,8)nner and more tender than(1671,13)a
new-born child. But no more of this.

Assum(933,8)(1687,8)to be(1750,22); then, when this skin,
as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one
hundred barrels of oil; an(979,10) is considered that, in quantity,
or(970,8)weight, that oil, in its expressed state,(2044,9)three
fourths, and not(590,12)(1262,9)(1953,10)at; some idea may hence
be had(1993,8)enormousness(1766,9)animated mass, a mere part of whose
mere integument yields(1738,8)lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten
(338,8)to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of(281,12)quarters(762,9)tuff(1617,13)’s skin.

In life, the visible surfa(316,10)(537,11)(916,8)the least among
the many marvels he presents. Almost invariab(1608,11)l over
obliquely crossed and re-(15,8)with numberless straight(1477,9)
thick array, something like those(764,8)finest Italian line
engravings. But these marks do not seem to be im(664,8)(1526,8)
(1270,19) above mentioned, bu(71,13)seen (1439,8)it, as
if they were engrav(103,11) body itself. Nor(1426,8) all. In some
instances,(586,8)quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a
veritabl(134,8)ing, but afford the ground for far other delineations.
These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers
on the walls of pyramids(87,13)s, then(91,8)(1460,12)word to
u(520,10)present connexion. By my retentive memor(1686,8)
(107,13) upon on(798,15)n particular, I was much struck
with a plate represent(1500,8)old Indian characters chiselled on the
famou(251,14) palisades (555,8)ank(1026,9)Upper Mississippi.
L(793,10)mystic rocks, too, th(23,8)-marked whale remains
undecipherable. This allusion(1216,8)Indian rocks reminds me of another
thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior(1180,13)
Whal(1137,10), he not seldom displays the back,(1948,10)especially
his flanks, effaced in great(1517,9)the regular(826,8)appearance, by
reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random
aspect. I should say that those New England rock(504,9)sea-coast,
which Agassiz imagines to bear th(1251,8)of violent scraping contact
with vast floating icebergs—(157,12),(158,12)rocks must not a
little resemble(1623,18)n this(830,11). It also seems to me
that such(335,10)(1496,8)whale are probably made by hostile(212,14)other whales; for I have most remarked them(1595,8)large,
full-grown bull(1896,10)pecies.

A word or two more concerning this matte(711,9)skin or blubb(23,9)
whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very
happy and significant. For(380,11)is indeed wrapt up in his(215,8)
as in a real(138,8) or counterpane; or, still better, an(1303,8)poncho
slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by (926,9)
this cosy(275,8)ing of his bod(721,10)(223,11)enabled to keep
himself comfortable in all weathers,(17,8)seas, times, and tides.
What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy
sea(1518,9)North, if unsupplied with (243,9)surtout? True, other
fish are found exceedingly brisk(126,10)Hyperborean waters; but
these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very
bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the
lee(1375,8)ceberg, as a traveller in winter(384,8)ask before an inn
fire; whereas, like man,(1139,11)has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his
blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after
explanation—that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as
indispensable as it is to man; h(137,13)that he(1657,8)b(528,8)at
home, immersed to his lips for life(675,10)Arctic waters! where, when
seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,
perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is
found glued in amber. But more surprising(415,8)o know, as has been
proved by experiment(1086,11)blood of a Polar(1326,10)warmer than
that of a Borneo negro in summer.

It does seem to me,(429,8)rein we see the rare virtue of a strong
individual vitality, and(53,20)thick wall(1201,8)he rare
(89,10)interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself
afte(1596,11)! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice.(37,14)
live in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep
thy blood fluid(37,8)Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter’s, and
l(40,14)whale, retain, O man!(1544,12)ons a temperature of
thine own.

But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,
how few are domed like(193,12)! of(1365,12)(50,8)vast as the
whale!


CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.

“Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!”

The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the
beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,
it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal.
Slowly it floats mo(765,9)re away, the water round it torn and
splashed by the insatiate shark(904,11)air above vexed with
rapacious flights of screaming fowls(1896,8)beaks are like so many
insulting poniards(469,8)whale. (439,9)white headless phantom floats
further and (12,8)from the ship, and every rod that it so floats,
what seem square roods of sharks and cubic(26,10)fowls, augment the
murderous din. For hours and hours(154,10)almost stationary ship that
hideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon
the fair face of the pleasant sea, waft(516,10)joyous breezes, that
great mass of death(628,8)on and on, till lost in infinite
perspectives.

There’s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all
in pious mourning,(679,8)-(429,8)ll punctiliously in black or
speckled. In life but few of them would have helped(1598,10), I ween,
if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his(227,8)
they most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from
which not the mightiest(2045,10)free.

Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost
survive(719,8)vers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war
or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring
the swar(1135,12)nevertheles(1330,8)shows the white mass floating in
the sun(1263,10)white spray heaving high against it; straightway(1719,10)’s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the
log—_shoals, roc(1412,8)breakers hereabouts: beware!_ And for years
afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping(449,9)as silly
sheep leap over a vacuum, becaus(1841,8)leader originally leaped there
when a stick was held. (1028,8)your law of precedents; t(32,11)
utility of tradition(36,11)the story of your obstinate survival of
old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hover(554,11)air!(195,9)orthodoxy!

Thus, while in life the great (543,8)body may have been a real terror
to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a
world.

Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than
the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who(121,8)
in them.


CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.

It should not(288,11)omitted that previous to completely stripp(1046,8)body(1774,8)leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the
Sperm W(1343,8)a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced
whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.

Consider that(1668,10) has nothing that can properly be called a neck;
on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that
very place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also,(190,9)
surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening
between him and his subject(1476,8)at(18,8) almost hidden in a
discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear
in mind, to(227,8)under these untoward circumstances he has to cut
many feet deep in the flesh; and(379,8) subterraneous manner,(560,8)
so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus
made, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,
and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion
(179,9)skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb’s boast, that he
demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?

When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a
cable till (1167,9)is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small
whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a
full grown(1291,10) this is impossible; for the(270,12)’s head
embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and(1435,12)to suspend
such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this
were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers’
scales.

The Pequod’s whale being decapitated and(459,10)(456,8)(536,10)
wa(422,10)against the ship’s side—about half way out(1700,8)sea, so
that it might yet in great part be buoyed up(815,8)native element. And
there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of
the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm
o(1220,8)ide projecting like a crane over the waves;(1659,8)that
blood-dripping head hung to t(447,13)aist like the giant
Holofernes’s(185,10)girdle of Judith.

When this last task was accomplished it was noon(1646,8)e seamen went
below to their dinner. Silence reigned(240,10)before(1648,12)but
now deserted deck. An intense copper calm,(327,8)universal yellow
lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves
upon(675,8).

A short space elapsed, and u(1635,9)i(84,11)ness came Ahab alone
from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to
gaz(565,11)side, then slowly(1800,9)(1784,9)main-chains he took
(1590,8)long spade—still remaining there aft(671,8)hale’s
(1054,9)ion—and striking it(1901,10)lower par(1004,9)half-suspended
mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood
(968,13)with eyes attentively fixed on this head.

It was a black and hooded head; and hang(262,10)in the midst of so
(658,8)a calm, it seemed the Sphynx’s(58,8)desert. “Speak, thou vast
and venerable head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished(1773,8)beard, yet here(1463,8)re lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty
(1222,10)tell us the secret thing that i(213,8)e. Of all divers, thou
hast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams,
has moved amid this world’s foundations. Where unrecorded names and
navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; w(492,8)her murderous
hold this frigate earth is ballast(392,8)bones of millions of the
drowned(1501,9)in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar
home. Thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many
a sailor’s side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay
them down. Thou saw’st the locked lovers when leapin(1857,10)ir

to each other, when heaven(914,8)false to them(174,17)
murdered mate when tossed by pirate(1856,11)midnight deck; for hours
he fell(1401,10)deeper(49,10)of the insatiate maw; and his(134,8)rs still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the
neighbor(345,8) that would have borne a righteous husband to
outstretched, longing arms. O head! t(641,9)seen enough to split the
planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!”

“Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice(410,11)ain-mast-head.

“Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,(86,8)Ahab, suddenly erecting
himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside (2017,9)brow. “That
lively cry up(1675,8)deadly calm might almost convert a better
man.—Where away?”

“Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze
to us!

“Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come alo(1555,8)way,
and to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man!
how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the
smallest atom stirs o(1211,8)on matter, but has its cunning duplicate
in mind.”


CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam’s Story.

Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the(24,8)came faster than
the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.

By and by, through the glass the stranger’s boa(912,9)nned (808,9)s
proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and
shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the
Pequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what
response would be made.

Here be it said, that like the vessel(1978,8)itary marines, (404,8)s
of the American Whale Fleet have each a privat(170,8); all which
signals being collected in a book with the names(1587,8)respective
(172,8)attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale
commanders are enabled to recognise(1879,11)(1210,8)e ocean, even at
considerable distances and with no small facility.

T(723,9)’s(463,12)at last responded to by(715,16)setting
her own; which proved(431,9) to be t(944,11) of Nantucket.
Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under(912,11)’s lee,
and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was
being rigged by Starbuck’s order to accommodate the visiting(506,8),
(1011,12) in question waved his hand(1702,11)oat’s stern in token
of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the
(373,9)had a malignant epidemic on bo(1093,8) that Mayhew, her
(215,8) was fearful of infecting(395,14)company. For, though(1984,8) and(237,8)crew remained untainte(133,9)ough his ship was
half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and
flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine(1152,8)land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with
(1617,10).

But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an
interval of some few yards(239,8) it(390,9)(1762,10)(922,12)’s
boat(1005,8)occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to(220,11),(1721,8)heavily forged(1833,13)sea (for by this time it
blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times
(1212,8)udden onset of a large(546,9)wave, the boat(1725,10)pushed
some way ahead; bu(36,11)soon skilfully brought to her proper
bearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now
and then, a conversation was sustained(501,9)the two parties; but at(560,9)s not without still another(125,13) of a very different
sort.

Pu(868,8) oar in(598,15) boat, was a man of a singular
appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual
notabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish
man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant
yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut
tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on
his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.

So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had
exclaimed—“That’s he! t(11,9)—the long-togged scaramouch the
Town-Ho(1614,10) told us of!”(105,8)ere alluded to a(1908,8) story
told of(1248,13), and a certain man among her crew, some time
previous when(1766,11) spoke the Town-Ho. Accord(1590,9)is account
and what was subsequently learned, it seemed(1975,9)(274,12)in
question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
(1512,8). His story was this:

H(478,11)originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
Shakers, where h(562,11)a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
meetings having several times descended from heaven(1717,8)way of a
trap-door, announcing the speedy opening(549,8)seventh vial, which he
carried(797,8)vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing
gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A(715,8),
apostolic whim(271,10)ized him,(353,8)left(390,10) for Nantucket,
where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,
common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate
for(1565,16)(1505,8)voyage. They engag(1278,8)but straightway
upon the ship’s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in
a freshet. He(550,8)(199,14)the archangel Gabriel, and commanded
the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he
set(321,9)forth(128,8)deliverer(1232,8)isles(696,10)a and
vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which
he declared these things;—the dark, daring play of his sleepless,
excited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real
(1682,8), united to invest this(387,8) in the mind(267,9)majority of
the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they
were afraid of him. As such a man, howev(991,8)not of much practical
use(174,8)ship, especially as he refused to work except when he
pleased, the incredulous(628,9)would fain have been r(181,9); but
appris(1637,10)at individual’s intention was to land him(363,8)first
convenient port,(802,15)forthwith opened all his seals and
vials—devot(1426,9)hip(548,9)hands to unconditional perdition, in
case thi(184,16)(1455,8)out. So strongly did he work upon his
disciples(1756,13)ew, that at last in a body they went to the
(1015,8)and told him if(679,9)was sent from(516,11)not a man of
them would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor
would they permit(813,9)to be any way maltreated, say or do what he
would; so that it came to pass tha(88,10)had the complete freedom(897,8)ship. The consequence(1180,8)this was,(658,8)(1386,12)cared
little or nothing (1600,8)(376,12)mates; and since the epidemic had
broken out, he(549,9)a higher hand than ever; declaring(155,9)
plague, as he called it, was at his sole(1559,8); nor should it be
stayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor
devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to
his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.
Such things may seem incredible; but(1315,9) wondrous, they are true.
Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respec(902,9)measureless self-deception(1843,8)fanatic(2011,8), as his (58,11)
power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to
return to the Pequod.

“I fear not thy(671,9), man,” said Ahab(1065,10)bulwarks, to Captain
Mayhew, who stood(1801,8)boat’s stern; “come on board.”

But now(1856,9)started(640,8)feet.

“Think, think(316,9)evers, yellow and bilious! Bewar(637,8) horribl(814,8)!”

“Gabriel!(1978,8)!” cried(211,8) Mayhew; “thou must either—” But that
instant a headlong wave shot(256,9) far ahead, and its seethings
drow(1682,8)speech.

“Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, whe(369,10) drifted
back(319,22)y whale-boat, stoven and sunk(320,15)
(320,8) tail!”

“I tell thee again,(1627,8), that—” But aga(520,11) tore ahead as if
dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a
succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional
caprices(917,8)seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the
hoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and(1939,12)
seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his(1699,10)
nature seemed to warrant.

When this interlude was over,(761,15) began a dark story
concerning Moby Dick; no(1358,10), without frequent interruptions from
(555,9)whenever his name was mention(1607,8)the crazy sea that seemed
leagued with him.

I(29,8)(1982,10)Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking
a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised(1487,8)existence of
(291,9)(199,10)havoc he had made. Greedily suc(1607,8)this
intelligence(862,9) solemnly warned the captain against attacking the
(1079,11), in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering
insanity, pronouncing(1171,16) to be no less a being than the
Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers r(1760,9)the Bible. But when, some
year or two afterwards,(656,10) was fairly sighted(1724,9)
mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burn(595,8)ardour to encounter him;
(663,9)aptain(1983,8) being not unwilling to let him have the
opportunity, despite all the(971,10)’s denunciations and
forewarning(197,8) succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many
perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last(157,14)getting one iron
fas(1358,13)(1606,9)ascending to the main-royal (455,9), was
toss(85,8)arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of
speedy doom(114,8)sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while
(598,11)mate, was standing up(862,8)boat’s bow, an(624,8)ll the
reckless energy(113,8)tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the
whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a
broad white shadow rose(853,9) sea; by its quick, fanning motion,
temporarily ta(1179,8) breath out(1915,8)bodi(1929,10)oarsmen. Next
instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious lif(383,8)mitten bodily
into the air(722,8)king a long arc(1284,8)descent, fell (57,9)sea
at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip(226,10)at was
harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but(593,9) for ever sank.

It is well to parenthesize here, tha(351,9)fatal accidents in the
Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as(2016,10)as any.
Sometimes, nothing is injured(196,11)n who is thus annihilated;
oftener(296,9)’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the
headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies(642,8)y. But
strangest of all is the circumstanc(351,8)in more instances than one,
when(90,9) has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is
discernible;(326,9)being stark dead.

The whole calamity, with the fal(1277,8)m of(1792,8)was plainly
descri(1841,11) ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! t(10,8)”
Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew(1095,10)further hunting of
the whale. This terrible event clothed(1845,14) with added
influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had
specifically fore-announced it, instead of only(1096,10)general
prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one
of many mark(950,8) wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror
(1751,8)hip.

Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,
that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which
Ahab answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, (669,8)once more started to
his feet, glaring(1869,9) old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with
downward pointed finger—“Think, think(1776,9)lasphemer—dead, and down
there!—beware(47,18)’s end!”

Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just
bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy
officers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look ov(1508,8)ag.”

Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various
ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,
depends(497,10)mer(909,8) of encountering them(904,8)four oceans.
Thus, most(169,9)never reach their mark; and many are only received
after attaining an age of two or three years or more.

Soon(365,9) returned with(440,10)in his hand. It was sorely
tumbled, damp, and cover(68,10)dull, spotted, green mould, in
consequence of being kept in a dark locker(769,8)cabin. Of such a
letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.

“Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but
a dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out,(375,10)took a
long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
insert the(888,8)there, and in that way, hand it(758,8)boat, without
its coming any closer(801,8)(1553,8)eantime, Ahab holding(123,11), muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a
woman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—(65,9) Macey,
Ship Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”

“Poor fellow! p(13,12)and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let
me have it.”

“Nay, keep it thyself,(596,8)(1609,8)to Ahab; “thou art soon going
(417,8).”

“Curses throttle thee!” yell(677,10)Captain(1456,9)stand by now to
receive it”; and tak(425,8)fatal missive from(1405,9)’s hands, he
caught it(1221,8)slit(1685,8)(680,10)reached it over towards the
boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;
(683,8) drifted a little(108,12) ship’s stern; so that, as if by
magic,(806,12)suddenly ranged along with(440,8)’s eager hand. He
clut(239,8)in an instant, seized(857,9)-knif(901,8)mpaling the
letter on it, sent it thus loaded back in(891,12) It fell at Ahab’s
feet. Then(615,9)shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their
oars(1067,14)manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the
Pequod.

As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work(1875,10)jacket
of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
affair.


CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.

In the tumultuous business of(1445,9)in and attending to a whale,
there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands
are wanted (1479,10)then again hands (38,11)there. T(127,8)no
staying in any one place; for at one(88,8) same time everything has
to be done everywhere. It(229,9)(63,9)with him who endeavors the
description(2002,8)scene. We must now retrace our way(996,9). It was
mentioned that upon first breaking grou(1779,8)e whale’s back, the
blubber-hook was inserted(877,10)original hole there cut by the
spades(1285,8)mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that
same hook get fixe(1960,10)hole? It(160,14)there by my
particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to
descend(883,10)monster’s back for the special purpose referred to.
But in very many cases, circumstances require that the(139,11) shall
remain o(436,11) till the whole flensing or stripping operation is
concluded. T(1078,10)be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,
except(1832,8)immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten
feet below the level(1846,8)deck, the poor(269,12)flounders about,
half(278,14)and half(736,9)ater, as the vast mass revolves like
a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question,(595,9) figured
in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at
least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better
chance to(468,8) him, as will presently be seen.

Be(463,8)savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pull(1993,9)w-oar
in his boat (the second one from(1496,8)), it was my cheerful duty to
att(888,9)him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble(1821,10)dead
(1241,12). You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by
a long cord. Just so,(2003,9) ship’s steep side, did I hol(1140,10)
(773,10)(1401,8)sea, by what is technically call(1262,8)e fishery a
monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his
waist.

It was a humorously peril(2005,13)for both of us. For, before we
proceed further, it must be said(1234,10)(186,11) was fast at both
ends; fast to(1448,9)’s broad(203,12), and(42,9)my narrow
leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two,(1475,9)time,
were wedded; and should poor(1002,10)sink to rise no more, then both
usage and honor demanded(841,8)nstead of cut(1350,9)cord, it should
drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature
united us.(1190,10)was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I
any way get rid(1441,9)angerous liabilities(1231,8)he hempen bond
entailed.

So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,
that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to
perceive that(271,10)dividuality was now merged in a joint stock
company of two;(74,9)free will had received a mortal wound; and that
another’s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited
disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of
interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity neve(552,8)have
so gross an injustice. And yet still(1064,8) pondering—while I jerked
him now and then from betwee(2022,16)ship, which would threaten
to jam him—(121,23), I say(285,13)this(625,11)of
mine was the precise(34,13) every(480,8)that breathes; only, in
most cases, he, one way or other, has this(968,9)connexion with a
plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your
apothecary by(629,9)sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,
you may say that, by exceeding caution, (40,8)possibly escape these
and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle(1571,11)(1811,12) heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I
came very near sliding overboard. N(1301,10)(208,10)forget that, do
what(119,10)I only had the management of one end of it.*

*T(1829,15)is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod
(1905,15) and his holder were ever tied together. This
improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man
than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest
possible guarantee(1966,9)faithfulness and vigilance of hi(532,15)older.

I have hinted t(428,11) often jerk(2029,15)(1150,16)
(1150,10)the ship—where he(76,8)ccasionally fall, from the incessant
rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy
he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made(473,9)m during the
night, the sharks now fresh(1965,8)ore keenly allur(96,10)before
pent blood which began to flow(262,10)carcass—the rabid creatures
swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.

And right in among thos(192,9)was(1063,9); who often pushed them
aside with his floundering feet. A thing al(810,8) incredible were it
not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.

Nevertheless, it may well be believ(749,8)since they have such a
ravenous finger(1103,8)pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to
them. Accordingly, besides(1162,11)-rope, with which I(2026,13)
jerked the poor fel(567,10)oo close a vicinity to the maw of what
seemed a peculiarly feroci(333,9)—he was provided with still another
protection. Suspended ov(1190,8)ide in one of the stages, Tashtego and
Daggoo continually flourish(79,8)his head a couple of keen
whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many(952,8)as they could
reach. This procedur(181,8)irs, to be sure, was very disinterested and
benevolent of them. They meant(1936,11) best happiness, I admit; but
in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and(1069,11)ircumstance that
both h(1413,12)arks were at times half hidden(1190,9)lood-muddled
water, those indiscreet spades(290,10) would come nearer amputating a
leg than a tail. But(1605,14), I suppose, strain(1530,8)gasping
there with that great iron hook—(80,26)only prayed
to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.

Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in
(975,8) slacked off the rope to every swell(829,9)ea—what matters
it, after all? Are you(1803,9)precious image of each and all of us men
in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those
sharks, your foes;(1644,8)pade(25,9)riends; and what between sharks
and(608,8)you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.

But courage! there is good cheer in store for you,(1787,9). For now,
as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last
climbs up the chains and stands all dripp(738,8)involuntarily
trembling(1356,14); the steward advances, and with a (1152,10),
consolatory glanc(720,8)him—what? Some hot Cognac? No!(37,10), ye
gods(20,11) a cup of tepid ginger and water!

“Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.
“Yes, this must be ginger,” peering(934,10)as yet untasted cup. Then
standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the
astonished(380,9)slowly saying, (242,9)ginger? and will you have
the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of
(91,8)Ginger! is(380,8)the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to
kindle a fire (1012,8)shivering cannibal(100,9)—what the devil is(134,9)Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what
(82,12)(471,8) I say, that you offer this cup to our poor
(1862,8) here.”

“T(1004,8)some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this
business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just
come from forward. “W(515,8)look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it,
if you please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he(173,8)“The
steward, Mr.(175,11)had the face to(354,9)at calomel and jalap to(359,9), there, this instant(1712,9)whale. Is(1181,14)n
apothecary, sir? and may I ask wheth(482,8)is(710,13)bitters by
which he blows back the(1960,11)a half-drowned man?”

“I trust not,” said(442,11)“it is poor stuff enough.”

“Aye, aye,(1387,8),” cri(1194,10)“we’ll teach you to drug a
harpooneer; none of your (270,10)’s medicine here; you want to poison
us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and(71,9)murder
us all, and pocket the proceed(100,9)”

“It was not me(242,9)(1178,11)“it was Aunt Charity that brought the
ginger on board; and bade me never give the (301,10)s any spirits,
but only th(1255,9)-jub—so she called it.”(1647,9)-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to
the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.
(1047,8). It(720,8)captain’s orders—grog for(255,15) on a
whale.”

“Enough,” replie(698,13)only don’t hit him again, but—”

“Oh, I never hurt when I hit, excep(19,12) a whale or(240,11)of
that sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about(1816,8)
sir?”

“O(460,8): go down with him(365,10)what thou wantest thyself.”

When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a
(1828,8)tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong(666,9) and
was handed to (1677,8); the second(808,17)’s gift, and that
was freely given to the waves.


CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk
over Him.

It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s
prodigious head hanging(188,8)Pequod’s side. But we must let it
continue(58,10)here a while till we can get a chance to attend to
it. For the present other matters press(365,8)e best(87,8)do now for
the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.

Now, dur(1933,8)past night and forenoon,(271,11) had gradually
drifted(1723,8)sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of(544,12)s, a specie(43,8)
Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained(1311,9)ure of
those inferior creatures(1148,8)ough(341,12)(1707,8)commissioned to
cruise(1379,8)m at(1793,10)though she had passed number(320,8)m near
the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that(812,14) had
been(1820,9)alongside and beheaded,(1015,8)surprise of all, the
announcement was made(110,8)(1021,11) should b(339,9)d that day,
if opportunity offered.

Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leew(2007,9)two
boats, Stubb’s(1188,10)’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further
and(12,8) away, they at last became almost invisible(1332,8)men at
the mast-head. But suddenl(1514,9)distance, they saw a great heap of
tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
both the boats(1404,9)fast. An interval(648,8)(1197,9)oa(373,8)in
plain sight,(1711,8)act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
towing whale. So close did the monster com(341,9)hull, that at first
it seemed as if he meant it malice; b(375,12)going down in a
maelstrom, within three rod(1218,9)planks, he wholly dis(2035,8) from
view, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the
ship(1909,8)boats(1416,9)for one instant,(244,8)on the poin(385,10)
(993,8)with a deadly dash against the vessel(1820,13)having plenty
of line yet(686,8)tub(1734,11)whale not sounding very rapidly, they
paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their
might so as to get ahead(1639,8)ship. For a few minutes the struggle
was intensely critical; for(2033,8)hey still slacked out the tightened
line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the
contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few
feet advanc(187,8)ought to gain(1790,8)ey stuck to it till they did
gain it; when(612,8)ly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning
along(753,9), a(381,9)ained line, scraping beneath(1050,9),
(1308,9)rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so
flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken
glass(862,8)water,(543,10) whale beyond also(176,9)sight, and once
more(1347,16)free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,
and blindly altering his course, went round the stern(793,12)(1391,8)the two boats after him, so(285,9)y performed a complete
circuit.

Meantim(1715,8)hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
flanking him on both side(1975,8) answered Flask with lance for lance;
and thus round and(259,11)Pequod the battle went(455,11)
multitudes of sharks that had before swum(345,11)Sperm Whale’s body,
rushed(2042,8)fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every
new gash(825,9)eager Israelites di(1326,9)new bursting fountains
that pou(1688,8) the smitten rock.

At last his spout grew thick, an(1402,8) frightful roll and vomit, he
turned upon his back a corpse.

W(815,9)two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
and in other ways gett(716,8)mass in readiness for towing, some
conversation ensued between them.

“I wonder w(1057,8)old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said
Stubb, not without some disgust(1766,8)thought of(1901,8)to do with so
ignoble a leviathan.

“W(135,10)it?” said Flask, coiling some spare (1696,8)(1147,8)’s bow,
“did you never hear(1300,10)ship which but once has a(758,14)
head hoisted on her starboard sid(2008,24)a Right
(831,8)on the larboard; (158,18), Stubb(1466,9)at ship can
never afterwards capsize?”

“Why not?

“I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,
and he seems to know all about ships’ charms. But I sometimes think
he’ll charm(370,10)to no good at last. (179,8)half like that chap,
Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved
into a snake’s head, Stubb?”

“Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a
dark n(1811,10)he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look
down there, Flask”—pointing into the sea(1206,8)peculiar motion of both
hands—“Aye, will I!(834,8)I ta(356,8)(508,9)to be the devil in
disguise. Do you believ(414,8)ock and bull story about his(1006,8)been
stowed away on board ship? He’s(117,10), I say. The reason why you
don’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries
it coil(143,8)in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! n(613,8)I think of
it, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff(432,10)toes(672,8)boots.”

“He sleeps(135,8)boots,(781,8)e? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve
seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”

“No doubt, and it’(325,10)of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye
see,(1396,8)eye of the(106,13)What’s(1632,13)have so much(1547,12)him for?”

“Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”

“Bargain?—about what(1299,8), do ye see,(1767,13)is hard bent after that White Whale, and
(784,10)there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then
he’ll surrender Moby Dick.”

“Pooh!(1596,8)you are skylarking; how can(1515,10)do t(298,8)(1586,14)Flask, but(1038,12)s a curious chap, and a wicked
one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a saunter(1236,13)old
flag-ship once, switching(1013,9) about devilish easy and
gentlemanlike, and inquiring if(646,9)governor was at home. Well, he
(22,11), and asked(1304,11)what he wanted. T(1213,10)(174,9)
his hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’ ‘What for?’ say(811,9)
(165,8). ‘What business is that of yours,(57,11)devil, getting
mad,—(113,8)to use him.’ ‘Take him(62,12)(280,8)—an(1706,8)
Lord(529,9)if(1566,11)didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before
he got through(1008,9), I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look
sharp—ain’t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get
the whale alongside.”

“(1502,8)I remember some such(1758,8)s you were telling,” said Flask,
when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
towards the ship, “but I can’t(157,10)where.”

“Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?
Did ye read it there, Flask?(1814,8) ye did?”

“No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,
Stubb, do you(1489,8) that that devil you was speaking of just now, was
the same you say is now on board the Pequod?”

“Am I (53,9)man that helped kill(655,11)? Doesn’(1291,12)live
for ever; who ever heard(193,8)(1070,9)as dead? Did you ever see any
parson a wearing mourning for(1407,10)? And(897,14)has a
latch-key to get(1358,10)admiral’s cabin, do(825,8)(364,8)he can
crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”

“How old(445,16)(1629,9)is, Stubb?”

“Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to(759,9); “well, that’s
the figure one; now take all the hoops in(496,11)’s hold, and string
along in a row(896,8)at mast, for oughts(667,10)ee; (140,10)
wouldn’t begin to b(251,10)’s age. Nor(154,9)coopers in creation
c(69,8)show hoops enough to make ought(22,8).”

“But see here,(2030,8)I thought you a little boasted(813,11)that you
meant to giv(437,11)a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if
he’s so old as all thos(392,8)(1696,8) come to, and if he is going to
live (845,8), what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me
that?

“Give him(178,8)ducking, anyhow(322,9)he’d crawl back.”

“Duck him again; and keep(69,8) him.”

“S(828,10)should take it into his head to duck you(1285,8)—yes, and
drown you—what then?”

“I(84,8)like to see him try it; I’d g(231,8)such a pair of black
eyes(1233,8) (682,9)dare to show his face(812,8)(1066,15)
again for a long while, let alone down(874,8)orlop(1584,8)where he
lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks(50,9) sneaks so much. Damn
(1397,9), Flask; s(1583,14)I’m afraid o(1310,11)? Who’s afraid
of him, except the old governor who daresn’t ca(619,8)and put him in
double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping
people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that(1240,9)people(1664,10)
kidnapped, he’d roast for him? There’s a(224,9)!(1413,12)(1451,16)wants to kidnap Captain Aha(1470,9)I(1951,9)it? You’ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now
to keep a sharp look-out on him;(1056,8)I(1820,8)thing very suspicious
going on, I’ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look
here, Beelzebub, you don’t do it(139,9)he makes any fuss,(98,8)Lord
I’ll make a grab(1026,10)pocke(403,8)s tail,(1064,9)to the capstan,
an(980,18)wrenching and heaving, that(82,9) will come
short off at the stump—(1728,12)and then, I rather guess when he
finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off without the
poor satisfaction of feeling(188,10)between his legs.”

“And what will you do(1953,8)e tail, Stub(664,9)with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”

“Now(2022,9)mean what you say, and have been saying all along(140,12)Mean or not mean, here we are(405,9)hip.”

The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale(1331,8)larboard side,
where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for
secur(1754,8)

“Didn’t I tell you so?” said(1404,8)“yes, you’ll soon see this right
whale’s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s.”

In good time, Flask’s(367,8)proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply
leaned over towards the sperm (156,12), now(973,9)counterpoise of
both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may
well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Lock(162,10)you go
over that way; but now,(1867,8)other side,(73,10)Kant’s and you come
back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep
trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw(1719,8)se thunder-heads overboard,
(1164,8) you will float light and right.

In disposing(2017,8)body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
case of a(592,12); only, i(934,8)tter instance, the head is cut
off whole,(389,8)the former the lips and tongue are separately removed
an(864,10)on deck, with(383,8) well known black bone attached to
what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this(235,9)present
case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;(529,8) head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair
of overburdening panniers.

Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the(596,12)(1069,9)and ever
and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there(2026,8)lines in his own
hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his
shadow; while, if(42,11)’s shadow wa(137,8)at all it seemed only
to blend with, and lengthen Ahab’s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish
speculations were bandied among them, concern(1857,8)these passing
things.


CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.

Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us
join them, and lay(36,9) our own.

Of the grand order of folio leviathans, t(188,14) (737,8)Right
Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales
regularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they(941,8) the two
extremes of(1073,9)known varieties(1390,8)whale(520,9)external
difference between them is mainly observable in(380,12); and as a
head of each is this moment hang(866,13)Pequod’s side(69,9)we
may freely go from on(894,9)other, by merely stepping across the
deck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to
study practical cetology than here?

In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast(363,8)
these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a
certain mathematical symmetry(1748,8)(899,14)which(715,16)’s sadly lacks. T(99,8)more character(82,22)head.
As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to
him, in point of pervading dignity. I(1727,13)(1963,12)oo, this
dignity is heightened(404,8)pepper and salt colour of his head at the
summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he
is w(1549,8)fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”

Let us now note (2039,8)least dissimila(414,8)(600,8)—namely,(1076,9)most important org(1258,9)ey(1250,10)ear. Far back on the side of the
(1875,10)low down, near the angle of either(1928,9)jaw, if you
narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out(1313,8)proportion is it to the
magnitu(222,9) head.

Now,(1210,8)is peculiar sideway position(1382,13)’s eyes, it is
plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more
than(64,8)one(39,10)stern. In a word, the(153,24)
eyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for
yourself, how it would fare with you, did you(296,8)s survey objects
through your ears. Y(467,8) find that you could only command some
thirty degrees of vision in(923,8)(1788,8)straight side-line of sight;
and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking
(97,9)towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day,(712,10) not
be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from
behind(528,13)(101,10)have two backs, so to speak; but,(1268,9)ame time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for(1164,9)it that makes
the fron(605,10)—what, indeed, but his eyes?

Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of(1218,9)s
are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
produce one picture and not two to the brain; the(1054,10)(1046,11)
(1046,18)effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of
solid head(1284,8)towers between them like a great mountain separating
two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly(62,8)e the
impressions which each independe(1618,8) imparts. T(1303,8), therefore,
must see one distinct(360,9)on this side, and another(43,9)
(43,13)at side; while all(279,9)must be profound darkness and
nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the
world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with(553,10), these two(53,8)are(391,9)ly inserted, making two
(325,9)windows, but sadly impairing the view. T(1745,12)ity(2008,8)(1731,12) is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and
to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.

A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
visual matter as touch(260,8)Leviathan. But I(552,9)content with a
hint. So long as(1829,10)yes are open(258,8)light, the act of seeing
is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically(65,8)whatever(1858,8) are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience
will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of
things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and
completely, to examine any two things—however large or (17,8)small—at
one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side
and tou(1233,8)other. But if you now come to(1299,13)se two
objects, and surround each by a circle of(1162,18); then, in
order(2048,8)one of them, in such a mann(722,8) bring your mind to
bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary
consciousness. How is(84,8)n, with (1757,9)? True, both(2003,9), in
themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more
comprehensive, combining(364,8)btle than man’s, that(722,8)at the
same mome(536,10)(658,12)(638,9)two(1679,11)rospects, one on
one side of him,(633,9)other in an exactly opposite direction? If he
can, then is it as marvellou(1394,10)in him, as if a man were able
(328,15)to go through the demonstrations of(221,13)
problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any
incongruity in this comparison.

It may be but an idle whim, but it has(1621,8)seemed to me(1176,9)e
extraordinary vacill(206,10)movement displayed by some whales when
beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer
frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly
proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their
divided and diametrical(616,12)powers of vision must involve them.

But the ear of(963,10) is full as(1920,10)s the eye. If you are an
entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over(1324,10) heads for
hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf(1818,9); and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind(284,10)With
respect(267,10)ears, this important difference is to be observed
between the sperm whal(1759,10)right. While(453,16)former has
an(292,10)opening, that(497,8)latter is entirely and evenly covered
over with a membrane, so(1659,8)e(2030,10)erceptible from without.

Is it not(597,8), that so vast a being(619,8)whale should see the
world(1244,9)so small an eye, and hear the thunder(1290,9)an ear
which is smaller than a hare’s?(2025,8)(1723,8) were broad(773,8)lens
of Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capac(839,12)porches of
cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?
Subtilize it.

Let us now with (856,8) levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
(1004,8)(705,12)’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending
by a ladd(1118,9) summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not
(1613,8) body is now completely separated from it,(755,8)lantern we
might desce(1124,12)great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But
let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What
a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,
lined, or rather papered(1009,8)glistening white(1026,11)glossy as
bridal satins.

But come out now(208,12)t this portentous lower jaw, which seems
like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one
end, instead of one sid(1739,10)pry it up(1237,11)get it overhead,
and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,
alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these
spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,
when fathoms down(122,8)sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there
suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging
straight down at right-angles(87,10)body, for all the world like a
ship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of
sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, (1115,9)hinges of his
jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a
reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon
him.

In most cases thi(895,11)—being easily unhinged by a practised
artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
the ivory(835,8)and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
with which(817,11)men fashion all sorts of curious articles,
including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.

With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
anchor; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other
work—Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,
are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, (118,8) lances
the gums; t(206,8)jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being
rigg(1937,8)aloft, they drag out these(577,9)s Michigan oxen drag
stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally
forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;
nor filled after our artificial(686,8). T(567,10)afterwards sawn
into slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.


CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.

Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long(2016,11)e Right
(96,8)head.

As in(349,8) shape the noble Sperm(147,9)head may be compared to a
Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly
rounded); so, at a broad view,(189,10)(138,14)bears a rather
inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred
years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its(298,8)o that of a
shoemaker’s last. And in this same last or sho(1701,8)old woman of the
nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be
lodged, she and all her progeny.

But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit
and(679,12)se two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole
head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in
its sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upo(482,8)trange,
crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—(380,8)en,
barnacled thing,(1873,11)Greenlanders call the “crown,”(235,8)
Southern fishers the “bonnet”(120,8)(1139,11); fixing(218,9)s
solely on thi(383,22)(377,9)the trunk of some huge oak,
with a bird’s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those
live crabs that nestle here(161,8) bonnet, such an idea will be almost
sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the
technical term “crown” also bestowed upon it; in which case you will
take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a
diademed king(593,8)sea, whose green crown(205,10)put together for
him(1195,9)marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a
very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. L(1690,9)at hanging lower
lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a(26,14), by
carpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a
(114,14)that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.

A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an
important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when
earthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery
threshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at
Mackinaw, I(297,8)take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good
Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof(371,10)twelve feet
high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular
ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us
with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar(1874,9)lats of whalebone,
say three hundred on a side(1660,8)depending from the upper part of the
head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere
been cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with
hairy fibres, through(1861,11)(1785,11) strains the water, and in
whose intricacies he ret(47,9)small fish, when openmouthed he goes
(126,8)the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central(293,8)of
bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious
marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the
creature’s ag(152,9) ag(889,8)oak by its circular rings. Th(268,8)
certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the
savor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we
must grant a far greater age to(561,17)than at first glance
will seem reasonable.

In old times(412,8)seem to have prevailed the most(432,8) fancies
concerning(757,8)linds. One voyager in Purchas calls them th(1049,10)
“whiskers”(1320,11)the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a
third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
“T(678,9)(1944,8)o(1147,9)and fifty fins growing on each (1506,8)his
upper _chop_(1193,8)arch over his tongue(61,20) mouth.”

*This reminds us(1959,8)(1064,14)really has a sort of whisker, or
rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the
(1364,17) outer end(431,8)lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts
impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
countenance.

As every one knows, these same(546,16),” “fins,” (622,9),”
“blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish(879,8)ladies their busks and
other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has
long been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time(532,10)bone was
in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those
ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaw(1792,8) whale, as
you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we
nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a
tent spread ov(68,12)bone.

But now forget all about(1780,8)and(859,8)s for a moment, and,
standing(277,8)(2000,11)(1224,8), look around you afresh. Seeing all
these colonnades of bone so methodically rang(408,8), would you not
think you were(1372,15)great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its
thousand pipes? For a carpet(1670,8)organ we have a rug(1476,8)softest
Turkey—the tongue(1303,8)is glued, as it were,(1759,8)floor of the
mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting
it on deck. T(916,14)(1431,8)now before us; at a passing glance I
should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you(1631,8)hat
amount of oil.

Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started
with—(1580,9)Sperm Whale and(1600,17)have almost entirely
different heads. To sum up, then:(738,22)there is no
great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible
of a(1626,10),(1061,8)(215,13)’s. Nor(1162,8)(241,13)re
there any of those(975,8)of bone; no hug(1731,8)lip; and scarcely
anyth(1837,9)tongue. Again,(337,19)s two external
spout-holes,(403,17)only one.

Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet
lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded,(1473,8)sea; the other
will not be very long in following.

Can you catch the(1993,12)of(425,18) there? It is(1475,9)
he died with, only som(1197,9)longer wrinkles(1651,8)forehead seem now
faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like
placidity, born of a speculative in(794,8)ce as to death. But mark the
other head’s(275,11). See that amazing(626,10), pressed by
accident against the vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace(1933,8).
Does not this whole (303,10)to speak of an enormous practical
resolution in facing death? This(1094,13)I take to have been a
Stoic;(1159,16), a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in
his latter years.


CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.

Ere quitting, for the nonce(902,17)’s head, I would have you,
as a sensible physiologist, simply—(1600,10)ly remark its front
aspect, in all its compacted collectedness.(127,17)
investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some
unexaggerated, intelligent estimate(1603,8)ever b(327,9)ram power may
be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for(1720,10)either
satisfactorily settle this matter with(185,9), or for ever remain an
infidel as to on(1056,9)most appalling, but not the less true events,
perhaps anywhere(1043,8)ound(422,8)(1310,8) history.

You observe that(1794,8)ordinary swimming posit(1282,22),
the front of his head presents an(1932,8)wholly vertical plane to the
water; y(148,16)th(1733,8)part of that front slopes
considerably backwards(1105,8)to furnish more of a retreat(838,9)long
socket which receives the boom-lik(1873,8)jaw(172,22)
mouth is entirely under the head, much(1699,9)ame way, indeed, as
though your own mouth were(85,16)your chin. Moreover you
(322,17)w(1992,9)n(1991,10) nose; and that what nose he
has—his spout hole—is on the top(493,12)(439,19)his eyes
and ears are at the sides(558,12), nearly one third(588,8)entire
length from (624,9). Wherefore,(930,10)now have perceived(413,10)(679,9)(1326,22) is a dead, blind wall, without a single
organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furtherm(173,9)are
now to (704,8) that only(907,8)extreme, lower,(733,9) sloping part
of(277,10)(1090,8)head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and
not till you get near twenty feet(383,11)orehead do you com(969,9)full cranial development. So(979,8)(1982,9)(1957,9)boneless mass is
as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents
partly comprise(1370,10)delicate oil; yet(403,9) now to be apprised(351,8)natur(1442,9)substance which so impregnably invests all that
apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how
the blubber wrap(1184,8)dy(1596,8)whale, as the rind wraps an orange.
Just so(1915,10)head; but(1934,8)is difference: about(1221,9) this
envelope(408,8) not so thick, is of a(475,10)toughness, inestimable
by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the
sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds
from it. It is as(218,8)(757,13)(1797,18) were paved
with horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.

Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
chance to crowd and crush towards each other(2046,8)docks, what do the
sailors do? They(206,8)suspend between them,(1509,8)point of coming
contact, any merely hard(842,10), like iron or wood. No, they hold
there a(240,8)round wad of tow and cork, (669,8)d(1899,8)thickest and
toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which
would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By
itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But
supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as
ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladd(568,9)m,
capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and(1190,8)(1932,11),
as far as I know, has no such provision in him;(1855,9)ing, too, the
otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head
altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated
ou(1938,9)water(174,13) the unobstructed elasticity of it(1381,10)(57,20)ique interior of(188,9); it has
(507,31)I say,(1942,8)ose mystical lung-celled
honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and
unsuspected connexion(1657,10)outer air, so as to be susceptible to
atmospheric(594,12)and(595,12). If this be so, fancy the
irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
destructive of all elements contributes.

Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable,(1134,8)able
wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a
mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood
is—by the cord; and all obedient to one volition,(982,8)smallest
insect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you(1357,8)
specialities(498,8)centrations of potency everywhere lurking in this
expansive monster;(134,14)show you some(844,8)more
in(1121,8)able braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all
ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this;(918,9)ugh the
(1316,11) stove a passage thr(40,8) Isthmus of Darien, and mixed
the Atlantic(901,10)Pacific, you would not(1222,8) one hair of your
eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and
sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander
giants(719,9)encounter; how small the chances for the(138,11)s
then? What befell the weakling youth lift(1457,8)dread goddess’s veil
at Lais?


CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.

Now comes the Baling(1580,8)Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
know someth(66,11)curious internal structure(1680,8)thing operated
upon.

Regard(1693,8)(1944,11)’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower
is the bony(189,10), form(1852,8)cranium and jaws(1331,8)e upper an
unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end(107,12)

almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an(533,9)
wall of a thick tendinous substance.

*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical
mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A q(122,8)a
solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp(455,9)ed by the
steep inclination of one side, inst(460,11)mutual tapering of both
sides.

T(687,8)(452,10)d part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
oil,(169,14) crossing and re(15,8), into ten thousand
infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres(1584,8)out its whole
extent. T(832,9)part, known(2004,8)Case, may be regarded(2033,8)great
(1259,15)(1236,8)(1728,11). And as that famous great tierce is
mystically carved in front, so(1639,10)’s vast plaited(911,10)forms
innumerable strange devi(1552,12)emblematical adornment of his
wondrous tun. Moreover,(192,9)of(1502,13)was always replenished
(1901,9)most excellent(1077,9)ines(1535,8)Rhenish valleys(240,9)tun
(1125,12) contains by far(96,10)precious of all his oily
vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,
limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this(140,10)(1108,9) found
unalloyed in any other par(279,9)creature. Though in life it remains
perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure(1176,8)air, after death, it soon
begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when
the first thin delicate ice is just(1731,9)in water. A larg(721,9)
case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from
unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and
dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish
business of securing what you can.

(1557,11)with what fine and costly material the(882,13)Tun was
coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not
possibly have compared (956,9)silken pearl-coloured membrane, like
the lining of a fine pelisse,(509,9)the inner surface(1320,13)
Whale’s case.

It will have been seen that(271,21)(1396,18)
embraces the entire length(1773,8)entire top(1791,8)head; and since—as
(1965,9)elsewhere set forth—(52,8) (109,9)one thir(1874,9)whole
(121,14)(998,8), then setting that(163,8)down at eighty feet
for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet(1530,8)
dep(256,10)tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a
ship’s side.

As in decapitat(493,8)whale, the operator’s instrument is brought
clos(1205,9)spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the
(1478,10) magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest
a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly
let out its invaluable contents. It(1584,9)(314,9)ed en(569,8)

that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen
combinations, on one side, make quite a wilder(1270,8)ropes in that
quarter.

Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in
this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby(1134,19)great(1372,17)is tapped.


CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.

Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the
par(828,8)it exactly projects over th(992,10)Tun. He has carried
with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,
travelling through a single-sheaved block. S(1829,8)this block, so that
it hangs down from the (249,10)he swings one(832,11) rope, till it
is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down
the other part, the Indian drops(238,9)the air, till dexterously he
lands on the summi(966,9)head. There—still high(1009,10)above the
res(1020,9)company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish
Muezzin ca(432,8)e good people to prayers(384,10)top of a tower. A
short-handled sharp spade(1005,8)ent up to him, he diligently searches
for the proper place to begin breaking(1526,9) Tun. In this business
he proceeds ver(1508,9)ly, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
sound(1743,9)alls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time
this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like
a well-(30,8)has been attached to(770,16)whip; while the
other end,(1409,8)tretched across the deck, is there(804,9)two or
three alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp(1757,8)Indian(687,10)another person has reached up a very long pole.
Insert(1077,9)pole(532,10)(322,8)(1416,9)downward guides the
bucket(585,13)(1070,9) entirely disappears; then giv(530,9)ord
to the seamen at(377,9), up comes(268,12)again, all bubbling(479,8)dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the
full-freighted vessel (1278,10)by an appointed hand, and quickly
emptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goe(1280,9)
the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the
end(1872,11)has to ram his(528,10) harder and harder, and deeper
(11,10)(495,15)until some twenty fee(1418,9)pole have gone
down.

Now, the(1310,8)of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
several tubs(52,10)filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once
a queer accident happened. Whether it was that(784,9), that wild(905,9)was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his
one-handed hold(1751,8)great cabled tackles suspe(1365,10)head; or
whether the place where he stood(160,8)treacherous and oozy(65,17)Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without
stating his particular reasons; how(335,8)exactly, there is no telling
now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth(1324,8)came
suckingly up—my God! poor(1234,9)—like the twin reciprocating bucket
in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down(1875,8)is great Tun of
Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of
sight!

“Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
came to his senses. “Sw(1961,8)bucket(877,9)!” and putting one foot
into it, so(411,8)better to secure his slippery hand-(737,12)whip
itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the to(1792,8) head, almost
before(1711,10)c(687,10)(1797,8)its interior bottom. Meantime, there
was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before
lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surfac(1288,9)sea,
as if that(1064,8)seiz(1243,8)some momentous idea; whereas(1200,8)only
the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
depth to which he had sunk.

At this instant, while(662,9)on the summi(1562,9)head, was clearing
(2039,8)—which had somehow got foul(1624,8)great cutting(1306,8)—a
sharp cracking noise was heard; and(586,8)unspeakable horror of all,
on(1684,9)two enormous hook(1408,21) tore out(991,12)
vast vibration the(75,10)mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship
reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,
upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every(466,8) to be
on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent
motions(969,12).

“Come down, c(11,8)!” yelled(794,8)men to(1266,9)but with one hand
holding on(1076,8)heavy(1855,8), so that i(1095,10) should drop, he
would still remain(1911,8)ed; the negro having cleared the foul line,
rammed down(1367,12)into the now collapsed well, meaning that the
buried harpooneer(173,8)grasp it, and so b(1343,8)d out.

“In heaven’s name, man,(1590,8)Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge
there?—Avast! How will that help him; jamm(186,9)iron-bound(1943,8)on
top of his head? Avast, will ye!”

“Stand clear(900,9)ackle(1773,9)a voice (1984,9)bursting of a
rocket.

Almost in the same(1185,11)ith a thunder-boom,(929,18)
(2027,8)(434,9)sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock(474,10)whirlpool; the
suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering
copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging—now(1720,9)
sailors’ heads, and (33,12) water—(1467,8)through a thick mist of
spray, was dimly beheld clinging(1967,8)pendulous(895,10)while poor,
buried-aliv(1980,11)was sinking utterly dow(976,9)bottom of the
sea! But hardly had the blinding vapor(931,9)away, when a naked
figure(532,8)boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swif(1948,11)en
hovering(333,10)bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my
brave Queequeg had dive(1720,9)rescue. One packed rush was made to the
side, an(1483,8)eye count(1501,9)ripple, as(199,8)followed moment,
and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands
now jum(844,9)a boat along(169,10)pushed a little off(1597,9)
ship.

“Ha! ha(1038,9)(1545,8)all at once, from his now quiet,(784,9) perch
overhead; and looking further(122,13) side, we saw an arm thrust
upright(1763,10)blue waves; a sight strange to see, as(70,15)forth(1831,10)grass over a grave.

“Both! both!—it is both!”—(264,12) again(1247,8)joyful shout; and
soon after,(611,10)was seen boldly striking o(1885,16), and
with the other clutching the long hai(1470,9)Indian. Drawn(1788,9)
waiting boat, they were quickly brought(1988,8)deck; but(1063,13)
long in coming to, and(830,10)did not look very brisk.

Now, how had this nobl(863,8) been accomplished? Why, diving aft(1361,8)lowly descending head(350,12)ith his keen sword had made side
lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then
dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,
and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first
thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that
was not as it (521,9)be, and might occasion great trouble;—he had
thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a
somerset upon(720,11); so that (782,9)next trial, he came forth in
the good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was
doing as well as(1395,10)expected.

And thus(1983,10)the courage and great skill in obstetrics of
(1659,8), the deliverance, or rather,(24,8)y of(1978,9), was
successfully(835,13), in the teeth, too,(1062,8)most untoward and
apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be
forgotten. Midwifery sh(1704,8)taught(151,8)same course with fencing
and boxing, riding and rowing.

I know(704,8)is queer adventure(1291,8)Gay-Header’s will be sure to
seem incredible to some landsmen, th(461,8)y themselves may have
either seen or heard of some one’s falling(1925,8)cistern ashore; an
accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than
(1529,10)’s, consider(1572,8)exceeding slipperiness(1585,8)curb of the
Sperm Whale’s well.

But, per(352,9), it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought
the tissued, infiltrated head(1727,8)(130,11), was the lightest and
most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of
a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at
all, but I have ye; for at the time(1497,11)fell in, the case had
been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the
dense tendinous wall(1006,8)well—a double welded, hammered substance,
as(200,8)before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of
which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking
in this(159,10) was(1236,8)present instance materially counteracted
by the other part(761,9)head remaining undetached from it,(1653,9)it
sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording (1499,8) a fair
chance for performing his agile(1561,13)n the run, as you may say.
Yes, it was a running(1570,9), so it was.

Now, had(1589,9) perished in that head, it had been a very precious
perishing; smother(63,8)e very whi(928,8) daintiest of fragrant
spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tomb(88,10)secret inner chamber
and sanctum sanctorum(742,9)hale. Only one sweeter end can readily be
recalled—(1907,8)cious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey
in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such(1413,12)tore of it, that
leaning too far over, it sucked him in(655,10)he died embalmed. How
many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and
sweetly(547,10)there?


CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.

To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bump(730,9)(1525,10)is
Leviathan; this is a thing(1816,9) Physiognomist or Phrenologist has
as yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as
for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkle(935,9)Rock of Gibraltar,
or for Gall(71,9)mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome(1936,8)Pantheon. Still,(948,9)famous work of his,(181,9)not only treats of
the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the(47,9)
horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the
modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his
disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the
p(566,9)cal characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,
though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer,(1712,8)application of
these two semi-sciences to(1227,10), I will do my endeavor. I try all
things; I achieve what I can.

(819,11)cally regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most
conspicuou(1916,9)features; a(72,9)it perhaps most modifies and
finally controls their combined(588,11); hence it(1003,12)that
its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect
the countenanc(941,8)(1664,8)For as in landscape gardening, a spire,
cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed(1200,8)indispensable
to the completion(1808,8)scene; so no face can be p(535,16)in
keeping without the elevated open-work belfry(1906,8)nose. Dash the
nose from Phidias’s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!
Nevertheless, (1553,9) is of so mighty a magnitude, all his
proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the
sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is
an added grandeur. A nose(985,13) would have been impertinent. As
on your(425,15) voyage you sail round his vast head in your
jolly-boat, your noble concep(1410,9)him are never insulted by the
reflection that he has a(210,9)be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which
so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest
royal beadle on his throne.

In some particulars,(1101,9)the most imposing(344,17)iew to
be had(1187,8)(1310,11), is that(1215,9)ull front of his head. This
aspect is sublime.

In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
morning. In the repos(1152,9)pasture, the curled brow(1396,8)bull has
a touch(1420,8)grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,
the elephant’s(201,9)majestic. Human or animal, the mystical(249,8)
as that great golden seal affix(654,9) German emperor(1835,8)ir
decrees. It signifies—“God: done this day by my hand.” But in most
(1774,8)s, nay in man himself, very often the(436,9)but a mere strip
of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which
like Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,
(1270,9)eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless(487,10)lakes;
and all above them in(182,13)’s wrinkles, you seem to track the
antlered(771,8)s(174,8)ing there to drink, as the Highland hunters
(79,9) snow prints(1915,8)deer.(466,8)the great(963,14)this
high and(1614,8)god-like dignity inheren(73,9)(928,8)so immensely
amplified, that gazing on it, in that(1061,12)view, you feel the
Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than i(1305,12)any other
object in living nature. For(397,8) no one point precisely; not one
distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;
he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a
(773,8), pleat(1270,8)riddles; dumbly lowering(1300,9) doom of boats,
and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;
though that way viewed its(2011,9) does not domineer upon you so. In
(113,9)you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic
depression(885,19)middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark
of genius.

But how? Genius(972,8)(1771,11)? Has(1792,16) ever written a
book, spoken a speech? No, his(1483,8)enius is declared in his doing
(540,8)(1972,10) to prove it. It is moreover(69,16)
pyramidical silence. And this reminds m(359,8)ad(1048,22)
been known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by
their child-magia(2030,9)s. They(45,9)the crocodil(1977,9)Nile,
because(35,15)is tongueless;(1072,9)(413,12)has no tongue,
or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of
protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall
lure back(1956,9) birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and
livingly enthrone them agai(781,9)now egotistical sky;(28,11)
unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove’s high seat,(1603,10)
(774,12)shall lord it.

Champollion deciphered the(1811,8)d granite hieroglyphics. But there is
no (75,12)to(78,9) the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s
face. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing
fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could
not read the simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle
meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to(112,10)awful Chaldee of
(1250,15)’s brow? I but p(1691,8)brow before you. Read it if you
can.


CHAPTER 80. The Nut.

If(1332,17)be p(397,9)ically a Sphinx,(1132,8)phrenologist
his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to
square.

In the full-grown creature the skull will measure(1076,10)twenty feet
in length. Unhinge the lower jaw,(1169,9)side view of this skull is as
(34,9)of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
base. But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this(94,16)is
angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
mass(1470,8)junk and sperm. At the high e(286,8)kull forms a crater to
bed that part(1551,8)mass; while under the long floor(354,9)crater—in
another cavity seldom(1525,10) ten inches (467,9) and as many in
depth—reposes(1444,8)e handful(471,9)monster’s brain. The brain is at
(582,17) from his apparent forehead(457,8); it is hidden away
behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the
amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it
secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
that(1973,21)an(1432,8)brain than(527,8)lpable semblance
of one form(672,10)cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in
strange folds, courses, and convolutions(1180,8)ir apprehensions, it
seems more in keeping with the idea(137,8)general might to regard that
mystic(759,9)him as the seat(204,8)intelligence.

It is plain, then, that(1349,11)cally the head(1163,9)Leviathan, in
the(1294,9)’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his
true brain, you can then see no ind(626,12)it, nor feel any. The
whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the
common world.

If you unload (1415,10)of its spermy heaps(1467,8)n take a rear view
of its rear end,(1650,8)s(1242,13), you will be struck by its
re(698,9)(1771,8)human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from
(29,9)point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down
(130,13)magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would
involuntarily confound it(767,9)m; and remarking the depressions on
one(1517,9)its summit, in(711,14) phrase(128,10) say—This man
had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,
considered alo(962,12)affirmative fac(907,9)prodigious bulk and
power(766,10)best form to yourself the truest, though not the most
exhilarating conception of w(1337,8)most exalted potency is.

But if from the comparative dimens(1523,8)the whale’s prop(1398,8), you
deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then(1545,8)(1916,8)idea
for you. If you attentively(1280,8)almost any quadruped’s spine, you
(851,15)(1374,9)(853,12)of its vertebræ to a strung
necklace of dwarf(790,8)s, all bearing rudimental(91,13)to the
skull proper. It is a German conceit, (1757,9)(138,9)are absolutely
undevelop(133,9). But the curious extern(135,14), I take it the
Germans were(578,9)first men to perceive. A foreign friend once
pointed it out to me,(1155,9)keleton of a foe he had slain, and with
(236,13)of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the
beaked prow(1978,8)canoe. Now, I (931,8)(354,10)(1767,10)sts have
omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations(823,9)
cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man’s
character(1559,9)found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel
your spine than your(1594,8)whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine
never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my(905,8)as in
the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half(610,8)the
(1948,8)Apply this(345,8)branch of(1532,10)y(1839,8)Sperm Whale. His cranial
cavity is continuous(1472,10)first neck-vertebra; and in that(1074,8)a
the bottom(1311,8)(495,12) will measure ten inches across, being
eight in height, and of a triangular figure(1636,10)base downwards. As
it passes(640,13)remaining(1256,11)he canal tapers in size, but
for a(827,9)able distanc(77,8)s of large capacity. Now, of course,
this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the
(832,8)ord—as the brain; and directly communicate(458,11)brain. And
what is still more, for many feet after emerging(1808,10)brain’s
cavity,(982,13)ord(277,12)an undecreasing girth,(1711,8)equal
to that(1872,8)brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be
unreasonable to survey and map out(1961,13)spin(1273,12)cally?
For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his
brain proper is more than compensated by(84,26)
magnitude(1476,8)(498,11).

But leaving this hint to operate as it may(2021,10)(1510,13), I
would merely assume(1437,12)theory for a moment, in refere(2000,11)(1105,11)’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one
of the larger(2038,9), and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer
convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call
this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness(2031,8)Sperm
Whale. And(1894,10)great monster is(66,12), you will yet have
reason to know.


CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.

The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,
Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.

At one time(226,10)est whaling people(283,8)world, the Dutch and
Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide
intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with
their flag(457,8)Pacific.

For some reason, the(298,9) seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
While yet som(1598,11)(1362,9)Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standin(223,8)
bows instead(1959,9)tern.

“What has he in his h(383,9)?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something
wavingly hel(1263,9)German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”

“Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr.(147,9); he’s
coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big
tin can(639,8)longsi(1436,8)m?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s all
right(116,15).”

“Go along with you,(356,8)Flask, “it’s (295,13) and an oil-can.
He’s out of oil, and has come a-begging.”

However curiou(1579,9)seem for(87,8)ship to be borrowing oil on the
whale-ground, and however much(1665,8)invertedly contradict the old
proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle,(828,9)times such a thing
really happens; and(1425,8)present case Captain (1246,14) did
indubitably conduct(369,16)s Flask did declare.

As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
heeding what he had(888,12); but(905,8)broken lingo,(851,11)
soon evinced his complete ignorance(1001,8)White Whale; immediately
turning the conversation to his(640,17)oil can, with some
remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
profound darkness—his last drop(1666,10) oil being gone, and not a
single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by
h(1240,8)hat his ship was indeed what(2043,8)Fishery is technically
called a _clean_ one (that is, an empty one), well deserv(393,8)name
of(1651,10)or t(2030,12)His necessities supplied,(744,8)departed(1870,8) had not gained his
ship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised(1731,9)
mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
(799,8)pausing to put his(1263,8) and(1294,14)board, he slewed
round his boat and made after the leviathan(1663,12)s.

Now, the game(701,8)risen to leew(108,8)and the other thre(912,9)boats that soon follow(1026,8)had considerably the start of the
Pequod’s keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Awar(1003,8)ir
danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before
the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in
harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling
a great wide parchment upon the sea.

Full in this rapid(95,8)nd many fathoms(1580,8)rear, swam a huge,
humped old bull, which by(1379,9)aratively slow progress, as well as
by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed
afflicted with the jaundice, or som(643,8)infirmity. Whether this
whale belonged to the pod in advance(112,8) questionable; for it is
not customary for such venerabl(850,11)s to be at all social.
Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake,(507,8)indeed their back water
must have retard(1877,8)because the white-bone or swell at(1857,8)ad
muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile
currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth
with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,
(1109,9)by strange subterranean commotions in him(706,8)seemed to
have egress(292,8)other buried extremity, c(1425,8)he waters behind
him to upbubble.

“Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m
afraid. Lord, think of(1428,8)half an acre of(64,13)! Adverse
winds are holding mad Christma(281,10)boys. It’s the first foul wind
I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so
before? it must be, he’s lost his tiller.”

As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan co(1484,9)a deck
load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her
way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now(1821,8)n partly
turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious
wake(1458,8)unnatural stump(43,8)starboard fin(1290,10)he had lost
that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.

“Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded
arm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing(1457,8)whale-line near him.

“Mind he don’t sling thee with it(93,9)Starbuck. “Give way, or the
German will have him.”

With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one
fish(1445,10)not only was he the largest,(569,8)refore the most
valuable whale, but he was nearest to them(67,9) oth(903,8)s were
going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for
the time. At this juncture the Pequod’s keels had shot by the thre(371,9)boats last lowered; but from the great start(709,8)had,
Derick’s boat still led the chas(1869,10)every moment neared by his
foreign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being
already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron
b(490,9)y could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he
seemed quite confident that this(137,10)the case, and occasionally(1939,8)deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at(614,11)boats.

“The ungracious and ungrateful dog!(912,16); “he mocks and
dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes
ago!”—then in (1462,8)intense whisper—(1030,11)greyhounds! Dog to
it!”

“I tell ye what it is, men”—(1110,8)ubb(503,8)crew—“it’s against my
religion to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous
Yarman—Pull—won’t ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye
love brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then,(1383,8)best man. Come, why
don’t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who’s that been dropping an
anchor overboard—w(1459,8)budge an inch—we’re becalmed. Halloo, here’s
grass growing(1802,8)boat’s bottom—and(1130,8)Lord, the mast there’s
budding. This won’t do, boys. Look (398,8)Yarman! The short and long
of(527,11), will ye spit fire or not?”

“Oh! see the suds he makes(782,9)Flask, dancing up and down—“What a
hump—Oh, _do_ pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my lads, _do_
spring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know,(66,8)—baked clams
and muffins—oh, _do_, _do_, spring,—he’s a hundred barreller—don’t lose
him now—don’t oh, _don’t!_—see(386,12)—Oh, (772,8) pull for your
duff(168,10)such a sog! (12,10)ger! D(64,8)love sperm? There
goes three thousand dollars, men!—a bank!—a whole bank! The bank of
England!(420,9)(281,11)!_—What(799,8)Yarman about now?”

(1867,8)moment Derick was(743,8)act of pitching(1425,23)
advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps(1382,10)double view of
retard(104,8)rivals’ way, and(1534,8)same time economically
accelerat(168,8)own(2047,8)momentary impetus of the backward tos(1612,11)mannerly Dutch dogger(1606,11)ubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty
(464,9)line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say,
Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces
for the honor of old Gayhead?(115,14)?”

“I say, pull like god-dam,(1665,8)the Indian.

Fiercely, but evenly incite(1301,9)taunt(373,9)German, the Pequod’s
three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
(483,8)ily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the
headsman when drawing near(1906,8)prey, the three mates stood up
proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating
cry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah (474,8)white-ash breeze! Down
(872,9)(1619,8)Sail over him!”

But so decided an original start had(1047,8)had, that spite of all
their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not
a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the
blade of his midship(359,8). While this clumsy lubber was striving to
free his(342,10), and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh
to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that
was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took
a mort(471,9)forwards, and slantingly ranged up(2024,8)German’s
quarter. An instant more(1517,8)l four boats were diagonically in the
whale’s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was
the foaming swell that he made.

It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was
now going head out, and sen(1702,9)spout before(673,11)ontinual
tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
fright. Now to this hand, n(18,8)at, he yawed in his faltering
fligh(188,8)till at every billow(318,9)broke, he spasmodically sank
in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky(229,9)beating fin. So
have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles(141,8)air, vainly(965,12) escape the piratical hawks. But the bird
has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the
fear of this vast dumb brut(1628,8) sea, was chained up and enchanted
in him; he had no(154,8)save that choking respiration through his
spirac(738,8)this made the sight of him unspeakably(791,9); while
still,(586,8)amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there
was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.

Seeing n(663,8)but a very few moments mor(1641,8)give the Pequod’s
boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled(1593,8)gam(1494,9)
chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long
dart, ere the last chanc(1830,8)for ever escape.

But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up(2048,9)stroke, than all
three tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to their
fee(1078,9)anding in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their
barbs; and darted over the head(794,8)German(228,11), their three
Nantucket irons entered t(1455,8). Blinding vapors of foam and
white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury(942,8)(1707,8)headlong
rush, bumped(1820,13) aside with such force, that both Derick and
his baffled(468,12)were spille(1642,12)ail(308,8)by t(189,8)
flying keels.

“Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing
glance upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all
right—I saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve
distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel
a sunbeam!(59,8)—Here we go lik(517,8)tin kettles at the tail of a
mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a
tilbury on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to
him that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too(78,10)
strike a hill(339,26)a fellow feels when he’s going
to Davy Jones—all a rush down an endless inclined plane(392,9) this
whale carries the everlasting mail!”

(1961,8)monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush,(858,10) lines flew round
the loggerheads(999,11)a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;
while so fearful w(1553,8)(1495,10)s that this rapid sounding would
soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they
caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at
last—owi(1574,9) perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
th(1405,9)whence(382,11)ropes went straight down into the blue—the
gunwales(1604,8)bows were almost even(212,10)water, whil(113,11)
sterns tilted high(1554,8)air. An(1638,11) soon ceasing to sound, for
some time they remained in that attitude,(515,9)of expending more
line, though the positio(756,8)little ticklish. But(47,8)boats have
been taken(917,8)d lost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as
it is called; this hooking up(1677,8)sharp barbs of his live flesh from
the back; this(115,9)at often torments the Leviathan into soon rising
again to meet(125,11)lance(125,8)foes. Yet not to speak of the
peril(2015,8)thing,(259,8)o be doubted whether this course is always
the best; for it is but reasonable to presume,(981,8)e longer the
stricken(599,8)tays under(679,8)the more he is(1014,8)ed. Because,
(903,13)enormous surfa(273,8)m—in a full grown sperm whale
something less than 2000 square feet—the pressure(874,8)water is
immense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we
ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground,(924,11); how
vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two
hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the(201,8)of fifty
(229,9)es. One whaleman has estimated it at(66,15)twenty
line-of-battle ships, with(1499,11)guns, and stores, and men on
board.

As(1748,11)boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down
into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any
sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;
what landsman would have thought, that benea(303,9)at silence and
placidity, the utmost monster(1608,8)seas was writhing and wrenching in
agony! Not eight inches of(1808,15)rope were visible(506,8)bows.
Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great(1323,10)
was suspended like the big(876,8)to an eight day clock. S(53,8)? and
to what? To(568,8)its of board. Is this the creature of whom it was
once so triumphantly said—“Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him
cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron
as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;
he laugheth(1022,8)shaking of a spear!” T(353,16)? this he? Oh!
that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength of
a thousand thighs in his tail,(1929,11)had run(399,10)under the
mountains(827,11), to hide him from the Pequod’s(456,12)!

In that sloping afternoon sunlight,(2027,8)dows(1869,10)(1240,11)
sent down(1021,9)the(1801,8), must have been long enough and broad
enough to shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appall(1925,10)
wounded whale(120,16)such huge phantoms flitting ove(752,10)!

“Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, a(1512,12)lines suddenly
vibrated(1846,8)water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
magnetic wires, the life and death throb(516,9)whale, so that every
oarsman felt them(622,8)seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
(591,9)downward strain(1366,12), th(1778,8)gave a sudden bounce
upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
scared(1705,8) into(1600,8).

“Haul in! (9,8)(444,16) again; “he’s rising.”

The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth
c(1825,10)been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
dripping(220,10)boats, and soon(497,10) broke water within two
ship’s length(1064,9)hunters.

His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land
animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,
whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least(402,8)ly
shut off in(135,9)directions. Not so(1425,10)whale; on(1863,8)se
peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular struc(1933,8)the
blood-vessels(908,10)when pierced even by so small a point as a
harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial
system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of
water at a great distance be(1772,8)(1512,9)his life may be said to
pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of
blood in him(766,8) distant and numerous its interior f(1824,8), that
he will keep thus bleeding and(13,10)for a considerable period; even
as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is(1538,9)ell-springs
of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now,(453,8)(1371,8)pulled
upon this(1528,8)and perilously drew(1759,10)swaying flukes, and the
lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets (1559,8)
new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural
spout-hole(1698,8)head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending
its affrighted moisture(1571,10)air. From this last vent no blood yet
came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life,
as they significantly call it, was untouched.

As(1857,11)now more closely surrounded(413,9) whole upper(157,8)
his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, wa(1544,9)
revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were
beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather(805,8)knot-hole(1712,8)
noblest oaks when prostrate, so(641,9) points whic(1506,11)’s eyes
had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.
But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm(17,9)
blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light
the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate
the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to
all. Still rolling(968,8)blood, at last he partially disclosed a
strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low
down on the flank.

“A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”

“Avast!(59,8)Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”

But humane(49,9) was too late. At the instant of the dart an
ulcerous jet shot(1392,8)is cruel(1390,8)and goaded by it into more
than sufferable anguish(1088,8)ale now spouting thick(435,8)with swift
fury blindly(1578,8)at the craft, bespattering them(1637,8)ir glorying
crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring
the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he
by loss of(677,8)that he helplessly rolled away(1135,10)wreck he had
made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,
then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the
white secrets of his belly; lay(67,8)log, and died(327,9)most
piteous, th(949,8)expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is
gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, an(281,8)alf-stifled
melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and(11,8)to the
ground—so the last long dy(206,9)(887,8)whale.

Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival(950,8)ship, the body
showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.
Immediately, by(1135,9)’s orders, lines were secured to it at
different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken
whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very
heedful management, when(306,9) drew nig(1171,13)was transferred
to her side, and was strongly(257,10)here(137,8)stiffest
fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the
body would at once sink to the bottom.

It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,
the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his
flesh,(1798,8)lower par(1634,9)bunch before described. But as the
stumps of(111,8)s are frequently(123,8)n the dead bodies of captured
whales,(228,10)flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence
of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have
been some other unknown reason(201,8)present case fully to account for
the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a
lance-head of ston(876,8)(342,9)him, not far(1657,10)buried iron,
(336,20)firm about it. Who had(1971,8)that stone lance? And
when? It might have been(2025,8)by some Nor’ West Indian long before
America was discovered.

What other marvels(104,17)rummaged (1423,9)is monstrous
cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further
(145,8)ies,(1058,9)hip’s being unprecedentedly dragge(1926,8)ideways
to the sea, owing(1026,10)dy’s immensely increasing tendency to sink.
However,(1497,9), who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to
(1744,8);(27,15)so resolutely, indeed, that when at(1111,8)the
ship would(504,11)capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with
(1785,8); then(1510,11)comm(1459,8)given to break cle(732,8)it, such
(812,8)immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the(1515,13) and cabl(1831,8)fasten(267,9)it was impossible to cast
them off. Meantime everything(1264,8)Pequod was aslant. To cross to the
ot(1716,8)(1399,8)deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a
house. T(1840,8)groaned and gasped. Many(1499,8)ivory inlayings of her
bulwark(279,9)ins were started(1122,9)(1361,8)(808,10)unnatural
dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear(450,9)
(476,10)(1949,14)to pry them adrift(1273,10)timberheads; and so
low(821,9)whale now settl(1919,8)the submerged ends could not be at
all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed
added(1037,8)sinking bulk, and(1135,9) seemed(1945,8)point of going
over.

“Hold on, h(9,8)won’t ye?” cried Stubb(1149,12), “don’t be in
such a devil of a hurr(1155,9)! By thunder, men, we must do something
or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your(534,11),
and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big
chains.”

“Knife? Aye, aye,(277,8)Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy
hatchet, he lean(1660,10)a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing
at the largest(720,13)(1691,8)few strokes, full of sparks, were
giv(1331,13)exceeding(1276,8)effected the rest. With a terrific
snap, every fastening went adrift;(646,10)righted,(284,8)case sank.

Now, this occasional inevitabl(733,10)of the recently killed Sperm
Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately
accounted(640,9)Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great
buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
surface. If the only whales(1117,8)us sank were old, meagre, and
broken-hearted creatures,(1385,8)ads of lard diminished and all their
bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that
this(1179,9)is caused by an uncommon specific gravity(1776,8)fish so
sinking, consequent(1946,8)is absence of buoyant matter in him. But it
is not so. For young whales,(1891,8)highest health, and swelling with
noble aspirations, prematurely cut off(1971,8)warm flush and May of
life, with(371,10) panting lard about them; even these brawny,
(233,8)heroes(1344,9)imes sink.

Be it said, however,(1695,10)(710,12)is far less liable to this
accident than any other species. Where(1381,8)that sort go down, twenty
Right Whales do. This difference(498,8)species is no doubt imputable
in no small degree(1790,8)greater quantity of bon(88,9)(128,11);
his Venetian blinds alone(325,11)weighing more than a ton; from this
incumbrance(340,20)wholly free. But there are instances
where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale
again rises, more(779,9)than in lif(135,10)(939,8)of this is
obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious
magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship
could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,
among the Bays of New Zealand, when a(528,12) gives token of(1133,10)the(1750,8) buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when
the body has gone(783,8)hey know where to look for it when it shall
have ascended again.

It was not long(571,11)(1830,15)body that a cry was heard from
the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing(1071,10)Jungfrau was again
lowering her boats; though(1720,10)spout in sight was that of a
Fin-Back, belonging(975,8)(1031,8)of uncapturable(1453,9)because of
its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the (122,8)’s(162,8)s
so similar(1108,8)(2025,11)’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is
often mistaken for it. And(1721,11)ly Derick(1905,9)his host were
now in valiant chase(936,9)unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all
sail, made after her fou(1783,8)keels, and thus they all disappeared
far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.

Oh! many are(360,13)s, and(28,14)Dericks, my friend.


CHAPTER 82. The Honor and Glory of(1016,8).

T(1360,9)some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the
true method.

The more I dive into this matter of w(1144,8)and push my researches up
to the very spring-head of it so much t(109,8)am I impressed with its
great honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many
great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other
have shed distinction upon it, I am transport(199,8)the reflection
that I myself belong,(1078,8)but subordinately, to so emblazoned a
fraternity.

The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to
the eternal honor of our calling be it said,(1299,10)(77,11)
attacked by our brotherhood(1453,9)kill(478,8)any sordid intent.
Those were the knightly days(144,8)profession, when we only bore arms
to succor the distressed, and not to fill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one
know(309,8)ne story of(358,8) and Andromeda; how the lovely
(26,9), the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast,
and as Leviathan was in(862,10)act of carry(1676,8)off,(526,10)the
prince(957,8)emen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and
delivered and marri(39,8)aid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,
rarely achieved by the best(125,9)ers(1988,8)present day; inasmuch as
thi(280,16)slain at(1148,10)first dart. And let no man doubt
this Arkite story; for(354,8)ancient Joppa, now Jaffa,(426,8)Syrian
coast, in one(186,8)Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast
skeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends(1854,9)the inhabitants
asserted to be the identical bone(348,9)monster tha(1086,9) slew.
When the Romans took(263,8)the same (176,9)was c(528,8)o Italy in
triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this
story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.

Akin to the adventure(962,25)—indeed, by some supposed
to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous(1066,10)St. George and
the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been(515,8)(658,9)many
old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled togeth(971,8)often stand for each other. “Thou art as a lion(909,8)waters, and as a
drag(31,10)sea,” saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning(222,10)in
truth, some version(1025,9)Bible use that word itself. Besides, it
would much subtract from the glory(1107,8)exploit had(420,12)but
encountered a crawling reptil(986,9)land, instead of doing battle
(2039,9)great(869,9)of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only
a(2000,12)(587,10), a Coffin, have the heart in them to march
boldly up to(1105,8).

Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
creature (308,12)by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
represented of a griffin-like shape, and(116,11) battle is depicted
on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering(413,11)ignorance
of those times, w(1281,8)true form(773,9)hale was unknown to artists;
and(108,15)at as in(1938,8)’ case,(1055,11)’s whale might have
crawled up out(866,11)(1659,8)beach; (112,21)the animal
ridden by(1167,12)(104,10) been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
bearing all this in mind, it will not appear al(1133,8) incompatib(793,12)sacred lege(442,11)ancientest draught(1705,9)scene, to
hold this so-calle(1273,8) no other than(897,11)Leviathan himself.
In fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story
will fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol(1910,8)Philistines,
Dagon by name; who being plant(155,14)ark of Israel, his horse’s
head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the
stump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble
stamp, ev(1730,10)man, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by
good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most
noble order(1937,14). And therefore, l(1300,11)kni(637,10)at
honorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do
with(2004,8)(561,8)eir great patron), let them never eye a(242,10)er
with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we
are much better entitled to(1178,14)decoration(857,9)y.

Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long
(596,8) dubious:(1634,12)according to the Greek mythologies, that
antique Crockett and Kit Carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good
deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by(1861,8); still, w(262,8)hat
strictly makes(765,11) of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere
appears that he ever actually(775,9)d his fish, unless, indeed, from
the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary
(1976,8); at any rate(1790,11)caught him, if he did(833,9)whale. I
claim him for(1071,12)clan.

But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of
(630,10)nd(1950,11)is(2033,9)ed to be derived from the still more
ancient Hebrew(95,9) Jonah(92,14); and vice versâ; certainly
they are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why(1147,8)
prophet?

Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone compris(425,8)ole
roll(1444,9)rder. Our grand master is still to be named; for like
royal kings of old times, we find the head waters(1556,8)fraternity in
nothing short(2009,8)great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental
story is now to be rehears(471,12)Shaster, which gives us the dread
Vishnoo(1729,9)the three persons(1605,8)godhead(1978,8)Hindoos; gives
us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—(116,9)who(756,9)first
of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified
(890,11)When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith(302,14)resolved
to recre(1010,9)orld afte(963,9)its periodical dissolu(174,8)e gave
birth to(281,8), to preside over(94,8)k; but the Vedas, or mystical
books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable(124,11)
before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
something(546,8)shape of practical hints to young architects, these
Vedas were lying at the bottom(795,8)waters; s(321,9) became
(541,8)e in(1682,8), and sounding down in him(1857,8)uttermost depths,
rescued the sacred volumes. Was not this(730,9)(1746,10), then? even
as a man who rides a horse is called(18,8)man?

Perseus, St. George, (1483,8), Jonah, and(853,8)! there’s a
member-roll for you! What club(587,9)(1917,8)’s can head off like
that?


CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.

Reference was made(345,8)h(50,9)(1592,29) in
the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this
(109,39). But then there were some
sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out(1838,10)orthodox pagans
of their(1549,8)equally doubt(598,8)(1864,8)(1959,22),
and Arion(1984,9)dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did
not make(30,18)one whit the less facts, for all that.

One old Sag-Harbor(577,13)hief reason for questio(1098,9)Hebrew
story was this:—He had(1639,10)ose quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
embellished with curious, unscientific plates;(1728,8)which represented
Jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true with
respect to a species(1979,8)Leviathan (the Right W(1164,10)the
variet(53,9)at order), concerning(1400,10) fishermen have this
saying, “A penny rol(1536,8)choke him”; his swallow is so very small.
But, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not
necessary,(1507,8)he Bishop, that we consider(1026,8)s tombed in the
whale’s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And
this seems reasonable enough(1692,8)good Bishop. For truly, (431,9)
Whale’s mouth would accommodate a coupl(613,8)st-tables, and
comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have
ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts(200,17) is toothless.

Another(951,8)which(992,12)(he went by that name) urged for his
want of faith in this matter(1962,8)prophet, was something obscurely in
r(1599,9)to his incarcerated body(1582,14)’s gastric juices. But
this objection likewise falls(2026,8)ground, because a German exegetist
supposes that(408,8)ust have taken refuge(589,8)floating body of a
_dead_ whale—even as the French soldiers(656,8)Russian campaign turned
their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has
been divined by other continental commentators(945,8)hen Jonah was
thrown overboard(1789,10)Joppa ship, he straightway effected his
escape to another vessel near by, some(21,8)with a whale for a
figure-head; and, I(920,8)dd, possibly called “The Whale,” as some
craft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull(12,8)Eagle.” Nor
have there been wanting learned(591,10)s who have opined that(1264,10) mention(1287,9) book of(1042,8)erely meant a life-preserver—an
inflated bag of wind—(1592,10)endangered(908,8) swam to, and so was
saved from a watery doom. Poor(2043,11), therefore, seems worsted all
round. But he had still(499,9)reason(1091,8) (1091,13). It was
this, if I remember right:(657,10)(1745,8)ed by(1052,10)(1612,8)Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere
within(46,11)’ journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much
more tha(74,22)across(846,10)nearest point of(206,19)coast. How is that?

But was there no other way for(289,11)to l(1359,8)(530,8)within
that short distance(234,11)? Yes. He(1702,11) carried him round by
the way(1540,8)Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak(1583,9)assage
through the whole length(1623,8)(479,13), and(1109,9)passage up
the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the
complete circumnavigation of all Africa (552,13),(220,16)
(538,10) waters, near the sit(359,12), being too shallow for any
(450,9)swim in(1515,11)this idea(1083,9)’s weathering(393,12)
(393,9) at so early a day would wrest the hono(1998,9)discovery of
that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed(68,9)er, and
so make modern history a liar.

But all these foolish arguments of old(1186,11) only evinced his
(53,8)pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing
tha(1239,9)but little learning except w(39,11)picked up(1840,9)
sun (897,8)sea. I say it only shows his(236,8), impious pride, and
abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a
Portuguese Catholic priest, this very(597,17)going to(1282,8)
via(1000,22) was advanced as a signal magnific(843,9)the
general miracle. And so it was(748,12)o this day, the highly
enlightened Turks devoutly believ(1567,8) historical story(1904,9).
And some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s
Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in(865,10)Jonah, in which
Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.


CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.

To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are
anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it
to be doubted that as(1491,8)procedure can do no harm, it may possibly
be of no contemptible advantage; consid(1347,8)at oil and water are
hostile;(32,10)is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to
(408,8) boat slide bravely. Queequeg(713,8)d strongly in anointing
his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau
disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;
crawling under its bottom, where it hung ove(1793,8)de, and rubbing in
the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair
(1398,8) craft’s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to
some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the
event.

Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered
flight, as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.

Nevertheless,(677,9)s pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great
exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
stricken whale,(1275,10)t all sounding, still continued his horizontal(254,9)with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings(1197,9)
planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became
imperative to lance the flying(230,8)or be content to lose him. But to
haul(1083,10)up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and
furious. What then remained?

Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
none exce(1530,8)fine manœuvre with the lance called p(1799,11) Small
sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It
is only indispensable with an inveterate runn(471,9); its grand fact
and feature is(364,9)erful distance(302,14)long lance is
accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme
headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or
twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter tha(1611,8)f the
harpoon, and also of a (48,8)material—pine. It is furnish(1284,8)a
small rop(518,9)a warp, of(2010,9)able length, by which it can be
hauled back to the hand after darting.

But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though
the harpoon may be(699,9)ed in the same way(748,15), yet it is
seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on
accoun(404,8) greater weight and inferior length(42,8)(193,8)as
compar(1688,8)(171,11)which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a
general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a(1577,8)before
any(1033,12) comes into play.

Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
equanimity(436,8)direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel
in(1209,14)Look at him; he stands upright(543,8)tossed bow(847,8)fly(1007,8); wrapt in fleecy foam, the tow(1656,9) is forty feet
ahead. Handling(1152,16)lightly, glancing twice or thrice along
its(556,8)to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers
up the coil(670,8)warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in
his grasp, leav(214,8)rest unobstructed. Then hold(250,9)ance full
before his waistband’s middle, he levels it at the(1537,8)when,
covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,
thereby elevat(417,8)point ti(1980,8)eapon(565,8)fairly balanced upon
his palm, fifteen(1478,9)the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,
ba(519,8)a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless
impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming
(1850,8), and quivers(1352,8)life spo(1251,9)whale. Instead of
sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.

“That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal
Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old
Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,
Tashtego, lad, I’d have ye hold a canakin(1813,8)jet, and we’d drink
round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch in the
spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the
living stuff.”

Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,
the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful
leash. The agonized whale go(1694,8)his flurry;(1449,8)-line is
slackened, and the(1764,9)er dropping astern, folds(1082,9)s, and
mutely watches the monster die.


CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.

That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages
before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and
sprinkling and mistify(1716,8)gardens(1590,8)deep, as with so many(67,12)or(66,12)pots; and t(245,9)ome centuries back,
(262,8)s of hunter(201,19)close by the(1003,9)(1971,8)whale, watching these (221,10)s and(268,9)s—that all thi(309,8)
be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute ((1524,8)and a quarter
minutes past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.
1851), it(465,8)still remain a problem, whether(241,9)outings are,
after all, really(1431,8)or nothing but vapor—this is surely a
noteworthy thing.

Let us, then, look at this matter, along(546,8)me interesting items
contingent. Every(754,11)that(485,8)peculiar cunning of their
gills, the finny tribes in general breathe(1930,8) which (502,8)imes
is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a
cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the
surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him
regular lungs,(1353,8)human being’s,(1974,10) can only live by
inhal(1016,8)disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the
necessity for his periodical visits(1791,8)upper world. But he cannot
in any degree(454,11)rough his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,
the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath(406,12); and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his
mouth. No, h(210,9)s(211,13)spiracle alone(1332,8)is is on the
top(2008,8)head.

If I say, that in any creatur(315,8)ing is only a function
indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from(847,9)a
certain(817,8), which being subsequently brought into contact(881,9)
blood impar(545,10)blood its viv(1615,8)rinciple, I do not think I
shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.
Assume it, and it foll(1177,9)if all(162,12)n a man could be
aerat(1105,8)on(707,8), he might then seal up his nostrils and not
fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then
live without(525,10). Anomalous as it may seem,(626,9)precisely the
case(1311,10)(1897,8)ho systematically lives, by intervals, his full
hour and more (when at the bottom)(172,9)drawing a singl(322,10)or
so (668,9)n any way (1212,9)a particle of air; for, remember, he has
no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side(899,8)spine
he is suppli(1604,8)a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of
vermicelli-like vessels(841,8)(15,11)en he quits the surface, are
completely distend(638,9)xygenated blood. So that for an hour or
more, a thousand fathoms(1529,8)sea, he carries a surplus stock of
(1088,8) in him, just as the camel cross(1634,8)waterless desert
(92,19)upply of drink for future use in its four
supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this(396,11)is
indisputabl(1407,9)at the supposition founded upon it is reasonable
and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I(977,9) the otherwise
inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,
as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon
rising(1974,8)(631,9)(1884,15) will continue there for a period
of time exactly uniform with all his other(132,11) risings. Say he
stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times(1813,8)s, respire(33,9)
breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his
(108,8)breaths over(56,8)to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few(139,8) you alarm him, so that he sounds(142,13)always dodging up
again to make good his regular allowanc(1302,8). And not till those(211,17)are told, will he finally go down to stay out(1513,10)term below. Remark, however(404,8)n different individuals these rates
are(38,10); but(1521,8)one they are alik(358,8)why sh(1793,8) whale
thus insist upon (819,24), unless it be to replenish
his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,
that this necessity for(1880,10)’s rising exposes him to all the fatal
hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast
(1092,10)be caught, when sailing(1547,20)beneath the
sunlight. Not (1940,8)thy skill, then, O hunter,(1544,8)great
(253,8)ies that strike the victory to thee!

In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for
two or three pulsations;(874,9)whatever other business he has to
attend to, waking or sleeping(160,8)e he must, or die(1094,8). But the
(1337,12)onl(1092,8)es about one seventh or Sunday of his time.

It has been sai(1710,11)w(88,19)through(1575,10)-hole;
if i(542,9)ruthfully be added that(1628,10)s are mixed with water,
then I opine we(899,8)be furnish(48,8)the reason why his sense of
smell seems obliterated in him;(807,9)only thing about him that at
all answers to his nose is that identical(262,12) and being so
clogg(177,9)wo elements,(299,10)not be expected(1560,9)the power
of smelling. But ow(1863,11)mystery(959,8)spout—whether it be water
or (23,14)vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at
on this head. Sure it is, nevertheles(1840,8)(2010,16)has no
proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no
violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.

Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube(797,8)(1488,8)
canal, and as that long canal—l(1133,8)grand Erie Canal—is(692,10)
with a sort of locks (that open and shut)(1476,9)downward retention of
air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore(966,11)has no voice;
unless you insult him by saying,(1224,8)en he so strangely rumbles, he
talk(1043,14)nose(1183,9)n again, what has(1110,11)to say?
Seldom have I known any profou(847,9)that had anything to say to this
world(1912,9)forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
living. Oh! happy(1289,11)orld is such an excellent listener!

Now,(902,10)i(548,8)(1883,8)(1452,11), chiefly intended as it is
(1989,8)conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
horizontally, just(1899,12) upper surfac(745,9)head, and a little
to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down
in a city on(81,9) of a street(1736,9) question returns(1196,8)
this(92,10)is also a water-pipe; in other words,(1256,9)(1297,9)
(386,18) is the mere vapor(1347,8)exhaled breath, (1337,10)
that(32,15) is(1735,17) taken in at the mouth, and
discharged(1866,9)the spiracle. It is(1419,8)(1931,10)mouth
indirectly communicates(1811,10)(634,14); but it cannot be
prov(1934,8)this is(1808,9)purpose of (167,8)ing(212,8)(174,10)
(174,10)Becaus(1282,8)eatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,
when in feeding he accidentally takes in water(558,10)(1621,11)’s
food is far(750,13)surface, and there he(267,8)spout even if he
would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your
watch, you will find(1357,11)unmolested, there is an undeviating
rhyme between the periods(1691,8)jets(213,8) ordinary(37,11)
respiration.

But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!
You have seen him spout; then declare w(2040,8)spout is; can you not
tell water from air? My dear sir, in this(1394,8)t is not so easy to
settle these plain things. I have ever found your(37,13) the
knottiest of all. And a(779,8)is whale spout, you might almost stand
in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.

The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
it; and how(359,9)certainly tell(1292,9)any(377,8)alls from it,
when, always, when you are close enough to a(1979,10)get a close view
of his(305,8)he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all
around him. And if at such times you should think that you really
perceived drops of moisture(343,9)pout, how do you know(2030,9)y are
not merely condensed(310,8)s vapor; or(70,35)those identical drops superficially lodged(161,13)-hole
fissure, which is countersunk into the summit(1731,8)whale’s head? For
even when tranquilly swimming(1674,13)mid-day sea in a calm, with
his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary’s(708,8)desert; even then,
(163,9) always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a
blazing sun(1393,10)sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with
rain.

Nor is it at all prudent(1821,9)hunter to be over curious touching the
precise nature(401,13) spout. It will not do for him to be peering
into(1118,9)putting his face in it. You(2011,8)go(1669,10) pitcher to
this fountain and fill(1208,9)bring it away. For (555,10)coming into
slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds(647,8)jet(696,8)will
often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of
the thing so(379,10)it. And I know one, who(195,12) still closer
(201,17)spout,(1328,9)with some scientific object in view, or
otherwise, I(396,8)say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.
Wherefore, among whalemen,(1868,13) deemed poisonous; they try to
evade it. Another thing;(1814,8)heard it said, and I do not much doubt
it, that i(454,9) is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind
you. The wisest t(800,8) investigator can do then, it seems to me, is
to let this dead(128,8) alone.

Still, we can hypothesize, even if we(803,8)prove and establish. My
(55,9)s is this:(1548,9)(380,10)nothing but mist. And besides
other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations
(1095,12) great inherent dignity and sublimity(1518,8)Sperm Whale; I
account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed
fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other
whales(1426,11)are. He is both ponderous and profound(970,8)am
convinced that(1042,10)heads of all(70,11)(66,8) beings, such as
Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, ther(1699,9)goes
up a certain semi-visible steam, while(1990,8)act of thinking deep
thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the
curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected
there, a(1731,9)involved worming and undulation(210,9)tmosphere over
my head. The invariable mois(1791,8)my hair(284,8)plunged in(272,13), after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an
August noon; this seems an additional argum(2002,12)above
supposition.

And how nobly it raises our conceit(2004,8)mighty, misty monster, to
behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
contemplations, and that vapor—as you will(937,11)see it—glorified
by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his (755,9)
For, d’ye see,(80,8)s(1669,8)visit the clear air; they only irradiate
vapor. And so,(340,10)ll the thick mists(1316,8)dim doubts in my
mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a
heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;
but(158,8)or denials, few along with them, hav(177,12). Doubts of
all things earthly, and(223,12)of some(39,8)(193,8); this
combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who
regards them both with equal eye.


CHAPTER 86. The Tail.

Other poets have warbled the p(906,8)f the soft eye(1797,8)antelope,
and the lovely plumag(40,9)bird that never alights; less celestial,
I celebrate a tail.

Reckon(1957,8)largest sized(1927,12)’s tail to begin at that point
of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises
upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.
The compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat
palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in
thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,
then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy
between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely
defined tha(1856,9)crescentic border(1184,8)(214,9). At its utmost
expans(1923,11)full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed
twenty feet across.

The entire member(1845,8) dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
into it, and you fi(1631,8)three distinct strata compose it:—upper,
middle, and lower. The fibres(314,8)upper(35,10) layers, are long
and horizontal; thos(1053,9)middle one, very short, and running
crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as
anything else, imparts power to(431,9). To the student of old Roman
walls,(189,12)layer will furnish a curious parallel(97,9)hin
course of tiles always alternati(1624,11) stone in those wonderful
relic(1863,9)antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the
great strength(408,9)asonry.

But as if this vast local power(833,8)tendinous tail were not enough,
the whole bulk(2045,8)leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of
muscular(643,8)and filaments, which passing on either side the loins
(604,11) down into th(1216,8), insensibly blend(2022,12)and
large(342,14)to their might; so that(287,9)ail the confluent
measureless forc(1841,9)whole whale seems concentrated to a point.
Could annihilation occur to matter, this were(640,9)g to do it.

Nor does this—its amazing(532,9), at all tend to cripple the graceful
flexion(1696,8)motions;(1862,8)nfantileness of ease undulates through a
Titanism of power. On(315,8)trary, those(99,8) derive(383,8)ost
appalling(1540,8)from it. Real(749,10)never impairs(1584,8)or
harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly
beautiful,(856,10)h(1161,8)to do(991,10)magic. Take away the tied
tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble(1742,9)arved
Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the
linen sheet(111,10)naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with
the massive chest(1128,10)n, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.
When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what
robustness is there. And whatever they may reveal(1701,8)divine love in
the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which
his idea has been most successfully embodied; these(71,11)so
destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but
the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance(1396,8)on
all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his
teachings.

Such is the subtle elasticity(1783,8)organ I treat of, that whether
wielded in sport, or in earnes(15,9)anger,(520,10)be the mood it
be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein
no fairy’s arm can transcend it.

Five great(1244,9)ar(311,11)to it. First, when us(820,8)fin for
progression; Second(44,17)mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;
Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.

First: Being horizontal in its positi(824,8)L(2042,8)’s tail acts in a
different manner(1254,10)tails(738,8)other sea creatures. It never
wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the
whale, his tail(654,9)ole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled
forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is
this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster
when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.

Second: It is a little significant(894,9)ile one sperm whale only
fights another(32,13)with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his
conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses(457,9). In
striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it(445,9)
blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be mad(1959,9)unobstructed
air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply
irresistible. No ribs of(770,8)boat can withstand it. Your only
salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the
opposing water, then partly owing(664,8)light buoyanc(1490,8)
whale-boa(356,10)(1528,15)its materials, a cracked rib or a
dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch(390,8)side, is generally the
most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received
in the fishery, that(1964,10)accounted mere child’s play. Some one
strips off a frock(282,10)hole is stopped.

Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that(661,8)whale
the sense of touch(2004,9)ntrated(709,8)tail; for in this respect
there is a delicacy in it only equall(811,10)daintiness(523,8)elephant’s trunk. This(77,11)s(1010,9)evinc(149,10)action of
(1745,8), when in maidenly gentleness(249,10) with a certain soft
slowness moves his immense(1046,13)side to side upon the surface of
the sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor,
whiskers and all. What tender(204,8)re is in that preliminary touch!
Had t(1751,9)any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of
Darmonodes’ (429,8) that so frequented the flower-market, and with low
salutations presented nosegays to damsels(1844,11)caressed their
zones. On mo(858,10)s than one, a pity it is(904,9) whale does not
possess this(276,12)virtue in(1604,9); for I have heard of yet
(1757,8)(703,8)(1814,9)en wound(829,10)fight, curved round his
trunk and extrac(325,8)dart.

Fourth: Stealing unawares(631,10)whal(1641,9)fancied securit(1388,9)middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence
of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a
hearth. But still you see his power(384,8)play. The broad palms of his
tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting(934,12), the
thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a
great gun had been discharged(1025,9)you noticed(1810,11)wreath of
vapor(377,10)spiracle at his other extremity, y(143,9)think that
that was the smoke(459,10)touch-hole.

Fifth: As(1818,8)ordinary floating posture of the leviathan th(1292,8)
lie considerably below(48,8)el of his back,(1804,10)then completely
out of sight beneath(1361,12); but when he is about to plunge into
the deeps, his entir(1462,9)with at least thirty feet(163,9)ody are
tossed erec(1833,9)air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they
downwards shoot out of view. Excep(655,11)blime _breach_—somewhere
else to be described—this peaking(413,8)whale’s(1699,8)is perhaps the
grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out(504,8)bottomless
profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting
forth his tormented colossal claw(1215,10)flame Baltic of Hell. But in
gazing at such scenes, it is all(286,8)what mood you are in; if in the
Dantean, the devils will occur to you(49,10)at of Isaiah, the
archangels. Stand(304,10) mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that
crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whale(1027,9)east,
all heading towards the sun, and for(755,9)(774,11)in concert with
peaked flukes. As it seemed to me(226,8)time, such a grand embodiment
of adoration(1163,8)gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of
the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified(1275,8)African
(2021,10)I then(42,18)whale, pronouncing him the most
devout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military(129,9)s of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks
uplifted(1527,8)profou(1054,8)lence.

The chance comparison in this chapter, between(1154,10) and the(298,11)so far as some aspects(1621,8)tail(1633,8)on(64,9) trunk
(25,8)ther are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite
organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they
respectively belong. For as the mightiest (543,8) is but a terrier to
L(1855,8), so, compared with (29,9)’s tail, his trunk(77,8)the
stalk of a lily. The most direful blo(1278,11)(688,8)’(76,8)were
as the playful tap of a fan(152,16)the measureless crush and
crash(1662,8)sperm(1668,9)ponderou(1678,8), which in repeated
instances have one after(496,11)hurled(1990,8)boat(1989,8)ll their
oars and crews into(1966,10)very much as an Indian juggler tosses his
balls.*

*Though all(760,17)e way of general bulk(770,22)
(380,12) is preposterous, inas(152,8)(1553,8)particular(831,13) stands in much the same respect to(893,11)that a dog does
to(518,13); nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of
curious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that(210,14)will often draw up water or dust in(765,10),(1105,8)n
elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.

The more I consider this mighty tail,(1318,8)e do I deplore my
inability to express it. At times(312,11)gestures in it, which,
though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly
inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are
these mystic(165,9), that I have heard hunters who have declared them
akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols;(484,9)(1789,8)indeed, by these
methods intelligently convers(1131,12)world. Nor are there(665,8)
other motion(1600,9)whale(563,8)(922,9)ody, full of strangeness,
and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I
may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I
know not even(1809,15)is(337,8)how understand his head? much
more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my
back parts, m(807,8)he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.
But I cannot completely make out his (106,10); and hint what he will
ab(44,8)face, I say again(199,10) face.


CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.

The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from
the territories of Birmah, forms t(1934,8)southerly point of all Asia.
In a continuous line(1971,8)at(154,11)stretch t(192,8)islands of
Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast
mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and
dividing(164,10)unbroke(1903,9)ocean(223,8)e thickly studded
oriental archipelagoes. This(150,8) is pierced by several sally-ports
for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which(1334,8) straits of Sunda and(544,8). By (37,20), chiefly,
vessels bound to China(256,10)west, emerge into the China seas.

Those(680,8)(144,17)divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
midway in that vast(335,9)of(586,8), buttressed by that bold green
promontory,(2000,8)o seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond
to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and
(1992,8)(618,8)inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,
and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand(877,11) that (682,8)
sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such
treasures(1834,8) very formation(1763,8)land, should at least bear the
appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded(909,10)all-grasping
western(1924,8)The shore(1899,9)S(795,17)re unsupplied with
those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the
Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these
Orientals do not dem(63,8)obsequious homage of lowered top-sails(1520,10)endless proces(461,8)ships before the wind, which for centuries
past, by night and by day, have passed between the(634,12)Sumatra
and Java, freighted with the costliest cargo(434,10)east. But while
they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce
their claim to more solid tribute.

Time out of mind the piratical proa(601,9)Malays, lurking among the
low shaded coves and isle(1442,8)matra, have sallied out upon the(1424,9)sailing through(1479,12), fiercely demanding(202,8) at the
(1991,9)their spears. Though(959,8)repeated bloody chastisements they
have received at the h(1128,8)European cruisers, the audacity of these
corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even(113,8)present
day, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in
those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.

With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these
straits; Ahab purposing to pass(497,12)m(1905,10)Javan sea, and
thence, cruising northwards, over waters(1797,10)be frequented here
and there(1487,8)Sperm Whale, sweep insho(34,10)Philippine Island(1701,8)ain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season
there. By these means, the circumnavigating(360,9)ould sweep almost
all the known(208,12)(298,10)grou(1831,9)e world, previous to
descending(919,9) Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere
else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby
Dick,(122,8)sea he was most(478,10)(475,8); and at a season when he
might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.

But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his
crew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time,
now(526,11)s-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs
no sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark(1633,8)oo(391,8)
whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be
transferred to foreign wharves;(666,10)-wandering whale-ship carries
no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and(18,8)ants. She has a
whole lake’s contents bott(701,8)er ample hold. She is ballas(2012,8)
utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She
carries years’ water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,
when three years afloat, th(53,11)er(857,9)Pacific, prefers to
drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,
from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, w(602,10)
ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at
a score of ports, the(598,11), in all that interval, may not have
sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating
seamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that
another flood had come; they would only answer—“Well, boys, here’s the
ark!”

Now, as many(1795,12)s had been captured off the western(1771,9)
Java(1447,9)near vicinity(1641,8)Straits of Sunda; indeed, (1486,8)of
the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised(1978,8)fishermen as an
excellent spot for(1793,9); therefore, as the(1873,8)gained more and
more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and
admonished to keep wide awake. But(1846,8)the green palmy cliff(1955,8)
land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the
fresh cinnamon was snuffed(2009,8)air, yet not a single jet was
descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling i(1538,8)ny game
hereabou(894,8)ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the
customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle
of singular magnificence saluted us(2045,8)ere be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with
which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm
Whales, instead of almost invariably sai(370,8)small detached
companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive
herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost
seem as if numerous nation(751,8)m had sworn solemn league and
covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation(1127,8)(1258,11) into such immense caravans, may be imputed the
circumstance that even(1868,8)best(1134,9) grounds, you may now
(325,10)sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by
(931,9)spout; and then be suddenly(723,9)by what(449,11)seems
thousands on (13,9).

Broad on both bows, at the d(368,8)of some two or three miles, and
forming a great semicircle,(576,11)one half(1579,8)level horizon, a
continuous chain of whale-je(1413,8)up-playing and spark(1157,8)the
noon-day air. Un(1919,8) straight perpendicular twin-jet(1415,8) Right
Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches,(2032,9)
cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the(1407,8)forward-slanting spou(1837,9)(710,12)presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually
ris(310,8)(1465,8)away to leeward.

Seen from(1841,11)’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill(2017,8)sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the
air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed
(513,9)(770,8) cheerful chimneys(736,9)dense metropolis, (1806,8)
of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.

As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile(1964,8)mountains,
accelerate their march, all eagerness to pla(1201,8)perilous passage in
their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the
plain; even so did this vast fleet(954,9)s now seem hurrying(747,8)
(463,8)(926,9)ts; gra(530,8)ontracting the wing(1598,8)ir
(1124,12)and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.

Crowding all sail(763,11) pressed after them; the harpooneers
handling their weapons, and loudly cheering(859,10)head(206,10) yet
suspended boats. If(249,8)d only held, little doubt had they, that
chase(810,10)these Straits of Sunda, the vast hos(1979,8)only deploy
(899,8) Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few(417,10)number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated(1940,8), Moby
Dick himself might not temporarily be(509,9)(1407,10) worshipped
white-elephant(1985,8)coronation procession(1692,8)Siamese! So with
stun-sail piled on (19,9), we sailed along, driving these leviathans
before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly
directing attention to something in our wake.

Corresponding to the(780,9)(44,8)van, we(1389,8)another in our
rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, (1647,18)
(159,10)(1942,10)pou(1916,10)whales; only they did not so
completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally
disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved
in his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to
wet the sails;—Malays, s(1783,8)after us!”

As if too long lurking behind(1106,9)lands, til(1222,13)should
fairly have entered(1405,12), these rascally Asiatics were now in
hot pursuit, to make up(391,8)ir over-cautious delay. But when the
swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how
very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on
to her own chosen(223,9)—mere riding-(450,10)rowels to her, that
they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in
his(1823,8) turn behold(1795,8)monsters he chased, and(1234,8)after one
the bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_; some such fancy as the above
seemed his(1477,8)en he glanced upon the green wall(970,10)atery
defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him(345,8)(1738,8)at gate lay the route to his vengeance(73,8)held, how(71,19)same gate he was now both(287,9)and being (1873,8)o his
deadly end; and not(1197,8)at, but a herd of remorseless wild(389,8)
and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with
their curses;—when all these conceits had passed (329,8)his brain,
Ahab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed(1875,11)black sand beach after
some stormy tide has been gnawing it(1418,10)being able to drag the
firm thing from its place.

But thoughts(2017,9)se troubled very few(1982,8)reckless crew; and
when, after steadily dropp(1702,8)(13,9)the(816,9)astern, the
Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra
side, emerging(77,9)(844,9)broad waters beyond; then, the
harpooneers(1930,8)more to grieve that the swift whales had been
gaining(957,10)ship, than to rejoic(70,12)hip had so
victoriously gain(1029,12)Malays. But still driving on(1185,8)wake
(2028,13), at length they(213,8)abating their speed; gradually the
ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was(784,9)o
spring to the boats. But no sooner di(1885,8)rd, by some presumed
wonderful instinct(1281,8)Sperm Whale, become notifie(1711,8) three
keels that wer(1478,8)them,—though as yet a mile in their rear,—than
they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so(1735,9)ir spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved
on with red(930,9)locity.

Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we spra(413,10)white-ash, and
after several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the
chase, when a general pausing commotion among(689,11) gave animating
token(885,9)y were now(986,10)nder the influence of that strange
perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it
(871,8)hale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns in
(1962,9)y(1078,9) hitherto rapidly and(1351,10)swimming,(254,9)
broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus’ elephants in
the Indian battle with Alexander(227,8)eemed going mad with
consternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,
and aimless(233,11) hither and thither, by(1198,8)hort thick
spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was
still more(563,8)ly evinced by those of their number, who, completely
paralysed as it were, helplessly float(1007,8)water-logged dismantled
ships(1751,8)sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple
sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolve(322,8)could not
possibly have(271,9)such excessive dismay. But this occasional
timidity is characteristic of(1090,8)all herding creatures. Though
banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the
West have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human
beings, how when herded(154,14)he sheepfold of a theatre’s pit,
they will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the
outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each
other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the
(811,10)gallied(1475,8)before us,(177,8)re is no folly(1988,8)beasts
of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.

Though man(95,9)whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
retreated, but collectively remained(1464,8)place. As is customary in
those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone
whale(1104,8)outskirt(794,8) shoal. In about three minutes’ time,
Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray
in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered
straight(774,8) heart(589,8)herd(1079,8) such a movement(1358,8)part(623,8)whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise
unprecedented; and indeed is(1233,10)ways more or less anticipated;
yet does it present on(1632,8) more perilous vicissitud(1230,10)fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and(11,8)into the
frantic shoal, you bid adieu to(266,8)pect life and only exist in a
delirious throb.

As, blind and deaf,(369,11)plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
speed to rid himself(1081,8)iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
thus tore a white gash(1453,9)ea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by
the crazed(1701,10) to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was
like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer
through their complicated channels(57,8)aits, knowing not at what
moment it may be locked in and crushed.

But not a bit daunted, (1039,8)(922,8) us manfully; now sheering off
from this(671,10)irectly across our route in(1355,8); now edg(1052,8)(72,8)at, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the
time, Starbuck stood up(1985,8)bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our
way whatever(1787,8)he could reach by short dart(1807,13)was no
time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, th(519,10)
wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to
the shouting p(1373,11)business. “Ou(1395,9)way, Commodore!” cried
one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,
and for an instant threa(998,9)swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,
the(155,10) a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed
calmly cooling(1168,9)with his own fan-like extremity.

All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented
by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of
equal size are stoutly clenched (562,8), so that they cross each
other’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then
attached(499,8)middle of this block, and the other end(2026,8)line
being looped, it can in a moment be(1555,13)a harpoon. It is
(768,9)mong gallied(967,8)that this drugg is used. For then, more
whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But
sperm(1092,8)are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you
must kill all(123,8). And if(139,8)not kill them all at once(68,11)wing them(520,16)an be afterwards killed at your leisure.
Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into
requisition. Our(1856,9) furnished with three of them. The first and
second(1555,8)ccessfully darted, and we saw the(1472,8)staggeringly
running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistanc(149,8) towing
drugg. They were cramped like malefactors(216,8)e chain and ball. But
upon flinging the third,(1721,8)act of tossing overboard the clumsy
wooden(867,8)it caught under on(187,9)seats(1535,9)oat, and in an
(1424,9)ore it out and carried it away, dropp(174,8)oarsman in the
boat’s bottom as(119,9) slid from under him. On both side(44,9)
came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and
shirts in, and so stopped the leaks(1980,8) time.

It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it
not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly
diminished; moreover(882,8)s we went still further and(12,9)from
the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So
that when at last the jerking(1408,8) drew out(1506,10)towing whale
sideways va(217,8)then,(796,10)tapering force of his parting
momentum, we glided between two(1506,8)(352,9)innermost heart of the
shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene
valley lake. Here the storms(947,8)roaring glens(167,10)he outermost
whale(562,8)heard but not felt. In this central expanse(804,9)presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by
the subtle moisture thrown off(1302,8)whale in his more quiet moods.
Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the
(423,9)every(680,10). And still(1298,8)distracted d(1435,8)we
beheld the tumul(1257,10)outer concentric circles, and saw(1612,8)ive
pods of (417,8)eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,
like multiplied spans of horses in a ring;(1178,8)closely shoulder to
(12,8)(1901,8) Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the
middle on(243,9)o have gone round on their backs. Owing to the
density(1793,8)crowd of repos(997,9)s, more immediately surrounding
the embayed axi(1672,9)herd, no (1383,9)ch(1904,8)escape was at(756,8) afforded us. We must watch for a breach(1859,8)living wall that
hemmed us in; the(28,10) had only admitt(39,8) order to shut us
up. Keeping(1705,8)centr(1901,9)lake(792,10)occasionally visited by
small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.

Now, inclusiv(2034,9)(119,10) wide interval(1176,14)revolving
outer(801,14)(84,17)space(1241,14)various pods in
any one of those(883,10)the entire area at this juncture, embra(1184,11)whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square
miles. At any rate—though indeed such a test at(15,9)ime might be
deceptive—spoutings(29,9) discovered from our low boat that seemed
playing up almost from the rim(787,9)orizon. I mention this
circumstance, because(1744,8)th(579,17) had been purposely
locked up in this(1837,11)fold; and(83,11)wide exten(1863,8) herd
had hitherto prev(1678,8)em from learning the precise cause of its
stopping; or,(1023,8)y, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way
innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller
whales—now and then visiting our becalmed boa(437,11)margin of the
lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still
becharmed panic which it was im(1318,9)not to marvel at. Like
household dogs they came snuffl(1712,10)us, right up to our gunwales,
and touching them; till it(697,8)seemed that some spell had suddenly
dome(439,8) them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched
(1691,11) with his lance; but fearful(1697,9)onsequences, for the
time refrain(936,8)darting it.

But far beneath this(452,10)world upon the surface, another and still
stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended
in those watery vaults, flo(334,8) form(1864,9)nursing mother(1887,8)
(1948,8)and those that by their enormous girth(470,8)shortly to become
mothers. T(1756,9)as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth
exceedingly transparent(1136,9)human infants while suckling will
calmly and fixedly gaze away(1352,10)breast(1302,8)leading two
different lives(1975,8)time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,
be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so
did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at
us(1536,8)we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.
Floating o(34,8)sid(1962,8)(588,8)also(1009,8)quietly eyeing us. One
(192,9)little(457,8), th(1329,8)certain queer tokens(1095,8)hardly a
day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six
(29,8)girth. He was a(159,8)frisky; though as yet his body(1967,8)scarce yet re(2018,13)that irksome position it had so lately
occupi(384,9) maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready
for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow.
The delicate side-fin(1050,9)e palms of his flukes, still freshly
retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived
from foreign parts.

“Line! line!” cried(1582,9),(779,9)(1334,9)gunwale; “him fast! him
fast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, on(696,8)!”

“What ails ye, man?(144,8)(1693,8).

“Look-e here,” sai(175,12)pointing down.

As when the stricken whale(802,12)the tub has reeled out hundreds
of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and
shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling
(1163,8)the air; so now,(1979,11)aw long coil(1698,9)umbilical cord
of Madame Leviathan, by which(1306,11)cub(1687,9)till tethered to
its dam. Not seldom(876,8)rapid vicissitude(1835,9)chase, this
natural line, with(937,14)end loose, becomes entangled(47,9)
hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some(1977,8)subtlest
secret(2001,9)sea(1311,9)divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We
saw young(342,10) amours(1156,8)deep.*

*The sperm(649,8)as with all other speci(313,10)(425,12)ut
unlike most other fish, breeds in(1906,9)ly at all seasons; after a
gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but
one at a time(1496,9)in some few known instances giving birth to an
Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,
curiously situated, one on each sid(508,9)anus; but the breasts
themselves extend upwards(1660,10). When by chance these precious
parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance(2038,12)’s
pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour(691,8) for rods. The milk
is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well
with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales
salute _more hominum_.

And thus,(566,8)surrounded by circle upon(12,8)of consternations and
affrights, did these inscrutable creatures (1055,8)entre freely and
fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled
in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of
my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;
and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down
and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.

Meanwhi(1261,8)e thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
spectacle(1361,10)istance evinced the activity(1789,8)other boats,
still engaged in drugging(687,11) on the frontier(1862,8)host; or
possibly carrying(50,8)war within the first circle, where abundance
of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight
of the enraged drugged(203,8)now and then blindly darting to and fro
across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is
sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or
maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done b(270,10)a short-handled
cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A
whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not
effectually(248,8)seemed, had broken away(1700,8)e boat,(670,9)
alo(1444,8)him half(724,9)arpoon line; and(859,8)extraordinary agony(619,8)wound, he was now dashing among th(1103,8)ing(591,8) like the
lone mounted desperado Arnold,(1441,8)battle of Saratoga(209,11)dismay wherever he went.

But agonizing as was(181,10) of this whale, and an appalling(1123,10) enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed
to inspire the rest(1094,9)erd, was ow(901,8) cause which at first
the intervening(1262,10)obscured from us. But at length we perceived
that by one(1298,8)unimaginable accidents(1328,8)fishery,(298,11)
had become entangle(554,9)harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run
away with the (866,13) in him; (1718,10)the free e(443,8)e rope
(896,9)to that weapon, had permanently caught(1583,8)coil(231,8)
(183,13)round his tail,(158,20)tself had worked loose
from his flesh. So that tormented to madness(820,13)churning
through the water, violently flaili(958,10)s flexible tail, and
toss(1731,8)keen spade about him, wounding and murder(1315,8)own
comrades.

This terrific objec(1137,8) to recall the whole herd(1145,9)ir
stationary fright. First,(1889,12)form(1908,8)margin of our lake
began to crowd a litt(944,8)tumble against each other, as if lifted by
half spent billows from afar; then the lak(480,9)began faintly to
heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;
in more and more contracting orbits(289,12)in the more central
(1353,8)(286,9)swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was
departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the
tumultuous masses of block-ice w(344,8)great river Hudson breaks up in
Spring, the entire host of(552,8)came tumbling upon their inner
centre(504,8)to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly
Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; (38,9)tak(876,8)stern.

“Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seiz(934,8)helm—“gripe your
oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,
you(196,9)—(882,9) there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up,
and stay so! (422,8)men—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape
them!—scrape away!”

The boat(1283,9)all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
narrow Dardanelles(59,10)heir long lengths. But by desperate
endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way
rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.
After many similar hair-breadth escapes,(168,13)wiftly glided into
what had just been(2029,12)outer circles, but now crossed by random
whales, all(1665,11)mak(192,8)one centre. This lucky salvation was
cheaply purchased by the loss of(866,9)’s hat, who, while standing in
the bows to prick the fugitiv(1609,8), had his hat taken clean (1943,8)
hea(131,9)air-eddy made(152,8)sudden (1860,8)of a pair of broad
flukes close by.

Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
resolved(1657,8)into wha(1901,9)a systematic movement; for having
clumped together(717,9)in one dense body, they then renewed their
onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;
but the boats still lingered i(1460,8)wake to pick up what drugged
whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask
had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of
which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at
hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both
to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,
should(421,11)of any other ship draw near.

The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
saying in the Fishery,—the mor(966,8) the less fish. Of all the
drugged(41,8)only one was captur(479,8)rest contrived to escape for
the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some
other craft than the Pequod.


CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.

The previous chapter gave account of an imm(958,9) or herd of Sperm
W(1451,8)nd there was also(1706,9)en the probable cause inducing those
vast aggregations.

Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
have been seen, even(1832,8)present day, small detached bands are
occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.
Such(87,10) known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those
composed almost entirely of fem(400,12)ose mustering none but young
vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.

In cavalier attendance up(1044,8)chool(148,13)you invariably see a
male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces
his gallantry by fall(1011,11)rear and covering the(1646,8)of his
ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about
over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by(1128,8) solaces and
endearments of the harem. The contrast between thi(148,9) and his
concubines is striking; because, while he is alway(108,9)largest
leviathanic proportions, the ladies(856,10)(456,9)th, are not more
than one-third(209,8)bulk of an average-sized male. They are
comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen
yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that(735,9)
whole(806,10)hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_.

It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
ramblings. Like fashionables,(957,11)or ever(1961,8)move in
leisurely search of variety. You meet them(2019,8)Line in time for the
full flower(672,8)Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,
perhaps, from spend(925,8)summer(1972,8)Northern seas, and so cheating
summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By (1931,8) they have
lounged up and dow(1724,9)menade(231,15) awhile, they start(2022,9)Oriental waters in anticipation(977,8)cool season there(219,8)
evade the other excessive temperatur(145,9)year.

When serenely advancing on on(190,8)se journeys, if any strange
suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young L(1126,8)
coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to(227,11)
(1175,8)with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases
him away! High times(1138,8), if unprincipled young rakes like him are
to be permitted to in(477,9)sanctity of domestic bliss; though do
what(179,12)will, he(1193,8)keep the most notorious Lothario out of
his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore(1514,12) often
cause(113,10)terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with
the whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They
fence with their long lower jaws,(90,11)locking them together, and
so striving(1253,8) supremacy like elks(667,8)rringly interweave their
antlers. Not a few are captured(1291,8)the deep scar(2019,8)se
encounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some
instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.

But suppos(1405,8)invader(662,18) to betake himself away at
the first rush(2018,8)harem’s lord, then is it very diverting(1799,9)
that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk(620,10)m again and
revels there(1445,9)still in tantalizing vicinity to(1161,8)othario,
like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.
Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give
cha(1253,16)se Grand Turks;(1943,8)(23,14) are too lavish
of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As(2041,9)sons and the daughters they beget, why, those (46,9)(42,10)must
take ca(1733,9)mselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For
like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my
Lord Whale has no taste(1026,9)nursery, however much(1056,9)bower;
and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all
over the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as
the ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as
reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude
overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the
love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,
admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands(1198,10), and grown to
an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone(1794,10) meridians
and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each(1170,8)eviathan from
his amorous errors.

Now, a(196,11) of(1131,8)is called by(1128,15)a school, so is
the lord and master of that school technically known as the
schoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character(854,9)
admirably satirical, that after going to(136,8)himself, he should then
go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.
His title, (216,12), would very naturally seem derived from the
name bestowed(682,10)harem itself, but some have surmised that the
man who first thus entitled this sort of(793,9)whale, must have read
the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed(2000,9)what(87,9)a
country-(480,12) that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and
what was the natu(1530,8)ose occult lessons he(446,9)ed into some of
his pupils.

The same secludedness and isolation to which the(461,13) whale
betakes(255,9)in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm
Whales. Almost universally, a lone whale—as a solitary(984,11)is
called—proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone,
he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to
wife in the wilderness of wat(1195,9)the best of wives she is, though
she keeps so many moody secret(448,9)chools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
mentioned, offer a strong contrast to(1305,11)schools. For while
those female(1334,8)are(1191,10)istically timid, the young(145,8)or
forty-barrel-bulls(1427,8)y call them, are by far the most pugnacious
of all(1525,10)s, and proverbially(56,10)dangerous to encounter;
excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,
and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.

The F(285,16)(504,9)are larger tha(1316,12)(426,9)Like a
mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,
tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous
lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,
and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about
in quest of settlements, that is, harems.

Another point of difference between the male and(859,8)(1003,8)is
still mo(870,17) of the sexes. Say you strike a
(585,17)—poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But(70,10)member(108,8)(1049,12),(1298,9)companions swim around her with
every token of concern(838,12)lingering so near her and so long, as
themselves to fall a prey.


CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.

The allusion(1263,8)waif and waif-poles(1493,8)last chapter but one,
necessitates some account(404,8)laws and regulations(432,8)whale
fishery, of(1910,11)waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.

It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,
a whale(122,8)struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed
and captured by another vessel(1859,9)ein are indirectly comprised
many minor contingencies, all partaking of this on(288,8)feature. For
example,—after a weary and perilous chase (181,11) of a whale, the
body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and
drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a
calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the
most vexatious and(180,9)disputes would often aris(1195,13)
fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,
undisputed law applicable to all cases.

Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in
A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any(264,9)whaling
law, yet the American (333,9) have been their own(207,9)ors and
lawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse
comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the By-law(1222,8)
Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s
Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing,
or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.

I. A(1595,11)belongs(1573,8)party fast to it.

II. A(1631,11) is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.

But what plays the mischief with(491,8)sterly code is the admirable
brevity of it, which (1702,13)a vast volume of commentaries to
expound it.

First: What is a(1874,10)? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,
when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at
all controllable(938,8)occupant or(12,9)s,—a mast, an oar, a
nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the
same. Likewise(249,27) (248,8)bears a waif, or any
other recognise(2007,9)of possession; so long as(638,11)waifing it
plainly evince their ability at any time to take(1583,15)as well
as their intention so to do.

These are scientific(569,13); but the(591,14)of the whalemen
themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the
Coke-upon-Littleton(101,8)fist. True, among the more upright and
honorabl(150,10) allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where
it would be an outrageous moral injustice for on(1081,8)to claim
(485,10) of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But
others are by no means so scrupulous.

Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated
in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of
(241,8)in the Northern seas; and when indeed they ((104,14)) had
succeeded in(1520,8)ing(531,8)h; they were at last, through peril of
their lives, obliged to forsake not only (41,8)nes,(756,8)ir boat
itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of(460,9)ship) came up
with(821,10), struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it
before the very ey(908,10)(424,10). A(358,8)thos(169,13)were
remonstra(1455,8), their captain snapped his fingers(464,8)(527,10)’
teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology(1897,8)deed he had
done, he would now retain(401,11),(2031,8)s, and boa(1795,9)had
remained attached(2002,8)whale at the time(1208,8)seizure. Wherefore
(747,15)now sued for the recovery(1275,8)valu(80,8)ir whale,
(175,24).

Mr. Erskine was counsel(97,9)(590,10); Lord Ellenborough was the
judge. In the cours(214,9)defence, the witty(113,10)ent on to
illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,
(1054,8)a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s
viciousness, had(958,8) abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in
(254,14)years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to
recover(1946,11) of he(429,15)on the other side; and he then
supported it by saying, that though the(304,10) had originally
harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of
the great stress of her plunging (378,34)
her; ye(397,9) her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and
t(851,8) when a subsequent(256,11)re-(244,10)her,(249,9) then
became that(65,21)’s property, along with whatever(338,8) might have been found sticking in her.

Now(1251,9)resent case(947,9)contended(469,8)e exampl(1410,9)
whale an(453,10) were reciprocally (895,9)ive of each other.

These pleadings,(77,9)counter(27,12)being duly heard,(1559,9)
learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as(1256,9)boat, he
awarded it(1464,8)(1954,10), because they had merely(964,11)it to
save(1884,9)ves; but that with regar(1457,9)controverted(1363,8)(1532,14)line, they belong(1518,10)(1345,12)(1896,11)because
it was a Loose-Fish(1563,20)final capture;(462,9)(1666,8)
(133,8)(258,9)when the fish made off (2031,8)m, it ((33,8))
acquired a(706,9) i(1962,8)articles(1119,8)nce anybody who afterwards
took(120,10)had a righ(431,8)m. Now(1627,15)(65,11) took
(185,8); ergo, the aforesaid(143,9) were theirs.

A common man looking at this deci(1352,8)(658,8) (658,8)Judge, might
possibly object to it. But ploughed up(638,9)rimary rock(882,8)matt(1084,8)two great principles laid down(988,8)twin whaling laws
previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by(1949,19)in
the above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and(657,11),
I say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human
jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of
sculpture, the Templ(797,9)Law, like(28,19)Philistines,
has but two props to stand on.

Is it not a saying in every one’s mouth, P(1944,10)is half(937,8)law:
that is, regardl(1782,8)ow the thing came into(2022,11)? But often

CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.

“De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.”
_Bracton, l. 3, c. 3._

Latin(1470,10)book(494,9)Laws of(630,8), which taken along with the
context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
that land, the King, as Honorary Grand H(1366,10) must have the head,
(705,8)Queen be respectfully presented(191,9) tail. A division
which, i(1298,8)ale, is much like halving an apple; there is no
intermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to
this day in force in(1029,8); and as it offers in various(241,8)s a
strange anomaly touching the(1454,8) law(1489,8) and(1312,14)t is
here treated of in a separate chapter,(466,8)same courteous(997,10)
that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of(110,11)
car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first
place, in curious proof(1787,8)fact that the above-mentioned law is
still(416,9), I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that
happened within the last two years.

It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one
of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
beaching a fine whale(1050,8)hey had originally descried afar off from
the shore. Now(152,17) are partially(198,8)how under the
jurisdic(484,8)a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.
Hold(780,8)office directly(1302,10)crown, I believe, all the royal
emoluments inciden(1690,8)(365,12) territories become by assignment
his. By some writers this(155,8)is(199,10)sinecure. But not so.
Because the(233,12) is busily employed at times in fobbing his
perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same(70,9)of
them.

Now when these poor sun-burn(701,10), bare-footed, an(1434,10)ir
trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their
fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good £150(1818,9)
precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea(200,12)wives, and good ale(231,11) cronies, up(1348,8)trength of their
respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and
charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and
laying it(170,10)whale’s head, he says—“Hands off! this fish, my
masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as(709,16)’s.” Upon this
the poor(1284,10)i(530,8)(2031,10) consternation—so truly
English—knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scrat(1851,9)ir
heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing(1102,10)whale to the(1949,8)r. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the
hard heart(1725,8)(520,8)(486,9)(851,9)(487,19). At
length one of them, after long(254,12)about for his ideas, made
bold to speak,

“Please, sir, who i(471,17)?”

“The Duke.”

“But the duke had nothing to do with taking(600,10)?”

“It is his.”

“We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all
that to go(1493,8)Duke’s benefit; we getting(170,9)at all for our
pains but our blisters(180,19)Is(98,9) so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
(139,8)a livelihood(106,20) thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of
this whale.(384,19)on’t(207,10)be content(1136,8)quarter or a half(453,18)In a word,(828,11)was seized and sold, and his Grace(325,10)of
Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular
lights, the case might by a bare possibility(64,9)small degree be
deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman
of the town(1262,11)ly addressed a note to(279,10), begging him to
take(209,10)of those unfortunate(1374,12)to full consideration. To
which my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)
that he had already done so, and(447,19), and would be
oblig(798,8)e reveren(1286,12)if for the future he ((45,12)
(1817,9)) would decline meddling with other people’s business. Is(1697,10)still militant old man, standing at the corners(1470,8)three
kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?

It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged righ(1593,9)Duke
to(879,15)a delegated one(1742,10)Sovereign. We must needs
inquire then on what principle(60,14) is originally invested
with that right. The law itself has(553,9)been set forth. But Plowdon
gives us the reason for it. Says(41,8)(1125,12)so caught belongs(277,8)King and Queen, “because of its superior excellence.” And by the
soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such
matters.

But why should(166,10)have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason
for that, ye lawyers!

In his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pin(919,9) old King’s Bench
author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s,
that(17,11) wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this
was written at a time when the black limber bone(922,8)Greenland or
Right(1685,11)largely used in ladies’ bodices. But this same bone is
not i(401,10); it is(19,8)head, which is a sad mistake for a
sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is(506,11)a mermaid, to be
present(308,8)a(536,8)n allegorical meaning may lurk here.

There are two royal fish so style(762,8) English law writers—(2007,9)
(671,8)sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and
nominally supplying the tenth branch(1382,8)crown’s ordinary revenue. I
know not that any other author has hinted(1459,8)matter; but by
inference it seems to me that(231,13) must be divided(523,8)same
way as(1421,10),(1155,10)receiv(224,8)highly dense and elastic head
peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be
humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there
seems a(1413,8)in all things, even in law.


CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.

“In vain it was to r(801,8)Ambergriese(872,8)pau(521,9)is
Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” _Sir T. Browne,
V.E._

It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when
we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea,(609,9)
many noses on t(321,9)’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than
the three pairs of eyes aloft. A (604,9)and not very pleasant smell
was smel(1257,9)sea.

“I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are
some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they
would keel up before long.”

Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside;(1897,8)r(623,9)distance
lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened (241,9) sort of whale must
be alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours
from his peak; an(1448,9)eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that
circl(695,8)hover(708,8)swooped around him,(921,8)plain(677,10)whal(206,11)(1293,9)w(1319,8)fishermen call a blast(479,8), that
is, a whale that has died unmolested(773,8)sea, and so floated an
unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor
such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city(1173,9)lague,
when the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable
indeed is it(1493,9) by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to
moor(415,11)of it. Yet are there those who will still do it;
notwithstand(1932,8)fact(1800,10)oil obtained from such subjects is of
a very inferior quality,(695,8)no means(2012,8)nature of
attar-of-rose.

Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw(1974,10)Frenchman
had a second (711,15)(1027,8)is(33,14)seemed even more of
a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be on(1268,10)
problematical(1274,8)that seem to dry up and die with a(1117,8)
prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies
almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the
proper place we shall see(688,9)knowing(1047,8)an will ever turn up
his nose at such(1051,9)as this, however much he may shun(1117,8)
whales in general.

T(1858,9) had now swept so nigh to(1399,13), that Stubb vowed he
recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled(1836,8)lin(462,8)were
knotted round the tail of(532,10)ese whales.

“There’s a pretty fellow, now,” he banteringly laughed, (949,9)in the
ship’s bows, “t(85,9)jackal for ye! I well kno(824,10)se Crappoes
of(838,8)en are but poor devils(1845,8)fishery; sometimes lowering
their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,
and(93,11)sailing from their port(1053,9)ir hold full of boxes of
tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all(1281,9)they
will get won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s wick into; aye, we all
know these things; but look ye, (523,9)Crappo that is content with
our(1005,8)s, the drugg(1910,8) there, I mean; aye, and(72,12)too
with scrap(1531,8)dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.
P(539,9)! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a
present of a little oil for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get
from that(273,22)wouldn’t be fi(1962,8)n in a jail; no,
not in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to
get more oil by chopping(1513,8)trying ou(900,8)three masts of ours,
than(227,10)(767,8)at bundle of bones; though, (986,9)I think of
it, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil(911,8)mbergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought(582,8). It’s worth
trying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he started(369,8)
quarter-deck.

By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether
or no, t(1600,10)was now fairly entrapp(1522,10)smell, with no hope
of escaping except by its breez(503,8)gain. Issu(1228,12) cabin,
Stubb now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off(651,9)(1749,8).
Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance(1351,9)
fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in
the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for
thorns had copper spikes project(1548,9)it here and there; the whole
terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon
her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de
Rose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this
aromatic ship.

Though Stubb did not understand the _Bouton_(435,9)the inscription,
yet the word _rose_,(329,8) bulbous figure-head put together,
sufficiently explained(383,10) to him.

“A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will
do very well; but how like all creation it smells!”

Now in order to hold direct communication(774,9) people on deck, he
had to pull rou(293,8)ows to the starboard side(329,8)us come close
to the blast(1969,8);(1275,8)talk over it.

Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still(308,14)he
bawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you (43,14)s that
speak English?”

“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man(1238,10)bulwarks, who turned out to be
the chief-mate.

“Well, then, my(142,15)-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”

“_What_ w(17,9)The _White_ Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick(94,8)e seen him?

“Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche!(143,12)—no.”

“Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”

Then rapidly pulling back towards(1727,11), and seeing Ahab leaning
over the (1865,12) rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two
hands into a trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab
retired, and Stubb returned(838,8)Frenchman.

He now(1722,16)the(626,13), who had just got into the
chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung(1143,9) in a sort of
bag.

“What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”

“I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered
(261,22)(1546,8)seem to relish the job he was at very
much. “But what are you holding _yours_ for?”

“Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have(1377,9)it on. Fine day, ain’t
it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will
ye,(1199,15)?”

“What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared(591,13)man,
flying(742,8)sudden passion.

“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, t(543,10)word! why don’t you pack those
whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do
you know, (1315,10)that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
such whales? As f(656,8)dried up on(734,8), he hasn’t a gill in his
whole carcase.”

“I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe
it; this is his first voyage;(726,9) Cologne manufacturer before. But
come aboard, and mayhap he’ll(110,8) you, if h(135,8)m(1955,10)I’ll
get out of this dirty scrape.”

“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow(1873,12)Stubb,
and with that he soon mount(1327,10)deck. There a queer scene
presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were
getting the heavy tackles in readines(561,8)e whales. But they worked
rather slow and talked very fast(1718,9)med in a(322,8)but a good
humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many
jib-booms. N(143,8)hen pairs of them would drop their work, and run up
to the mast-head(860,8)some fresh air. Some thinking(278,8)uld catch
the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their
nostrils. Others having broken the stem(226,8)ir pipes almost short
off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so(1144,8)
constantly filled their olfactories.

Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from
(1081,11)’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a
fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from
within. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain
remonstrating against the(235,11)(661,8) day, had betaken himself(651,8)(266,22)(_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the
pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and
indignations at times.

Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
(1953,8)-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
expressed his detestation of his(1670,9)as a conceited ignoramus, who
had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.
Sounding him carefully(285,8)further perceived that the (265,12)
had not the slightest suspicion concern(1472,8)ambergris. He therefore
held his peace on(1650,8)ad, but otherwise was quite frank and
confidential(394,11)(1043,8)the two quickly concocte(452,11)plan
for both circumventing and satiriz(1672,8)Captain, with(656,8)at all
dreaming of distrus(1728,8)ir sincerity. Accord(611,9)is(141,13)(1316,8)s,(374,17), under cover of an interpreter’s office,
was to tell(927,12) what he pleased, but as com(1241,8) Stubb; and
as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost
in him(800,8)the interview.

By this time their destined victim appear(1886,8)his cabin. He was a
small and dark, but rather delicate(1420,9)man for a sea-c(466,12)
large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet
vest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman(1180,8)was now
politely introduced by(529,19)who at once ostentati(1840,8)t
on the aspect of(559,10)ing between them.

“What shall I say to him first?” said he.

“Why,” said(542,8)eye(1006,8)velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you
may as well begin by tell(1185,8)that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
though I don’t pretend to be a judge.”

“He says, Monsieur(198,8)(876,18)in French,(1555,12)his
(564,9)“that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
blasted whale they (1572,12)alongside.”

Upon this th(138,9) started, and eagerly desired to know more(548,9)now(527,8)(1562,16) to Stubb(550,8) since he takes it so easy, tell(487,10)now I have eyed him
(1697,11)I’m quite certai(1580,9)’s no more fit to command a
whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact(142,11)from me he’s a
baboon(575,8)vows and declare(588,12)(1837,10)other whale, the dried one,
is far more deadly than the (462,8)one; in fine(97,12)he conjures
us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”

Instantly(521,13)ran forward, and in a loud voice(344,8)ed his
crew to desist from hoi(1782,9) cutting-tackles, and(1198,9)cast
loose the cables and chains confin(1914,8)whales to the ship(654,36), when(1795,13)had returned to
(1277,10)y, let me see; yes, you (1189,12)(690,9)now that—that—in fact,
(722,9)I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody
els(1196,24)(754,11)very happy to have been of any service to
us.”

Hearing this,(1023,13)vowed(698,9)y were the grateful parties
(meaning(189,8) and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into
(1983,9) to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.

“He wants you to take a glass of wine with him(1481,12)(1766,9)er.

“Thank him heartily; but(1151,10)it’s against my principles(165,9)
with the man(478,13)(1090,20)I must go(457,30)is(107,12)won’t admit of his drinking;
but that if(1724,9) wants to live another day(348,9), then(1774,9)
had best drop all four boats, and pull(868,9) away(1089,12)whales,
for it’s so calm they won’t drift.”

By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
(1636,20)this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his
boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the
light(1492,8) of the two(1375,9) ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s
boats, then, were engaged in tow(1338,8)ship one way, Stubb
benevolently towed away at his(2048,10)(1660,8)ay, ostentatiously
slack(213,8)a most unusually(312,14).

Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off(273,10)whale;
(1556,9)(473,8)s,(281,14) soon increased his distance, while
the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale. Whereupon Stubb
quickly pulled(1610,8)floating body, and hail(1731,8)Pequod to give
notice(926,8)intentions,(1751,9)proceeded to reap the fru(981,9)
unrighteous cunning. Seiz(292,8)sharp boat-spade, he commenced an
excavation in the(191,8) little behind(870,9) fin. You would almost
have thought he was digging a cellar there(103,8)sea; and when at
length his spade struck(1358,9)the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up
old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew
were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking
as anxious as gold-hunters.

And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and duck(13,8)
scream(28,9)yell(41,9)fighting around them.(1339,11)beginning
to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay(871,10),
when suddenly from(1262,8) very heart of this plague, there stole a
faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells
without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then
along with(1800,8), (87,8)at all blendi(38,8)it for a time.

“I have it, (11,10)” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something
(807,8)ubterranean regions, “a purse! (9,8)”

Dropp(1018,9)(1007,9)thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
(130,9) that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old
cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with
your thumb; it is of a hue(1456,9)yellow and ash colour. And this,
good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any
druggist. Some six(300,10)were obtained; but more was unavoidably
lost(1269,11), and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were
it not for impatient Ahab’s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come
on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.


CHAPTER 92. A(319,8).

Now th(340,12) is a very curious sub(1918,8)and so important as an
article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
Coffin was examined at the bar of the(1519,9)House of Commons on that
subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
the precise origin of(292,11)remained, like amber itself, a problem
to the learned. Th(1271,9)word(373,14)but the French compound
for grey amber, yet the two(410,10)s are quite distin(260,9)mber,
though at times found o(1991,9)-coast, is also dug up in some far
inland soils, wherea(569,15)never found except up(101,10).
Besides,(307,8)s a hard, transparent, brittle, odorles(644,12)
used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but(1084,10)
is soft, waxy(730,9)highly fragrant and spicy(720,8)t is largely
used in(1767,8)ry, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and
pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for
the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.
Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.

Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should
regale themselves(1991,8) essence found(1422,8)inglorious bowels of a
sick whale! Yet so it is. By some,(1267,14)supposed to be the
cause, and by others the effect,(1172,8)dyspepsia(1569,8)whale. How to
cure such a(43,12)t were hard to say, unless by administering
three or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then running out of
harm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.

I have forgotten to say that there wer(399,13)(1949,13)
(1522,8)hard, round, bony plates, which at first(1779,8)hought might be
sailors’ trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned ou(1532,8)hey were
nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner(1844,9)at the incorruption of this most(1091,11)(1883,9)should be
(707,13)heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that
saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about (166,11)and(183,13);
h(210,8)we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise
call to mind that (156,10)Paracelsus about w(1355,10)that maketh the
best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of
ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is
the worst.

I(441,8)like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but
cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against
whalemen, and which,(1281,8)estima(640,8)some already biased minds,
(848,8) considered as indirectly(1893,8)tiated by what has been said
of the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere(1041,9)volume the slanderous
aspersion(95,10)disproved,(863,10)voc(219,9)whaling is
throughout a slatternly, untidy business. Bu(1196,8)is another thing to
rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this
odious stigma originate?

I opine, t(751,10)plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
Greenland(253,9)ships in London,(1230,11)two centuries ago. Because
those (582,8) did(849,8)n, and do not now, try out their oil at sea
as the Southern ships have(296,8)done; but cutting up the fresh
blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,
and carry it home(1445,15); the shortness(1961,8)season in those
Icy Sea(1842,10) sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,
forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking
into the hold, and unloading one of the(453,8) cemeteries(1032,8)(556,11)dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising
from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a
Lying-in Hospital.

I partly surmise also(1000,9)is wicked(1283,8)against whalers may be
(1645,8) imputed(828,8)existence on the coast of (833,9), in former
times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which
latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great
work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports
(smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this(224,9)was founded in order to
afford a place(475,9)(944,8)of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried
out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a
collec(1740,8)furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works
were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But
all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a
voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with
oil, does not,(63,10)consume fifty days in the(1796,9) of boiling
out; and(36,8)state(1695,12)casked, the oil is nearly scentless.
The truth(1230,10)living or dead, if but decently treated,(1880,9)s a
species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can(1735,10)be
recognised, as the peopl(1329,8) middle ages affected to detect a Jew
i(1078,8)mpany,(960,8)nose. Nor indeed can th(1412,8)possibly be
otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high
health; taking abundance of exercise;(1901,8)out of doors; though, it
is true, seldom(529,8)open air. I say(1406,9)e mo(883,8)a Sperm
Whale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented
lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the
(857,11) to for(352,8)ce, considering his magnitude? Must it not be
(1769,8)famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redol(1005,9)myrrh,
which was led(389,8)an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great?


CHAPTER 93. The Castaway.

It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
significant event befell the most in(36,12)of the Pequod’s crew;
an event most lamentable(1404,8)ich e(1620,8)provid(152,8)sometimes
madly merry and predestinated craf(1364,9)living and ever accompanying
prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.

Now,(1311,8)whale ship, it is not every one that goe(1360,10)oats.
S(399,8)hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is
to work the vessel while(106,10) are pursu(484,8)whale. A(1100,11)
thing, these(120,13) are as hardy fellows(1315,8)men comprising
(222,9)’ crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy,
or timorous wight(1638,9)hip, that(24,8)s(1932,8) to be made a
(313,11). It was so(1745,8)Pequod with the little negro Pippin by
nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;
ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so
gloomy-jolly.

In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and
a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven
in one eccentric span. But while hapless(159,11)was by nature dull
and torpid in his intellects, Pip(141,10)ver tender-hearted, was at
bottom very brigh(1425,8)that pleasant, genial, joll(42,8)ness
peculiar to his tribe; a tribe,(1184,8)ver enjoy all holidays and
festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks,
the year’s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five
Fourth of Julys and New Year’s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that
this(802,8)black was brilliant, for even blackness has it(38,10)cy;
behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king’s cabinets. But Pip loved
life, and all life’s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking
business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had
most sadly blurred his(593,11); though, as ere long will be seen,
what was thus temporarily subdued in him(1646,9)end was destined to be
luridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him
off to ten times the natural lustre with which(941,8)native Tolland
County in Connecticut,(354,8)once enlivened many a fiddler’s frolic on
the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned
the round horizon into one star-belled(1424,11). So(1277,9)in the
clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the
pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning
jeweller w(1031,10)you the(84,9)in its most impressive lustre, he
lays it(179,11)gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun,
but by some un(544,8)gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences,
infernally superb; t(246,8)evil-blazing(307,8), once the divinest
symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from
the King of Hell. But let us to the story.

It came to pas(846,8)in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman
chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to(1149,8)quite maimed;
and,(1070,12), Pip was put into his place.

The first time Stubb lowered(833,8)m, Pip evinced much nervousness;
but happily, for that time, escaped close contact(1918,8)e whale; and
therefore came off not altogether discreditably(1348,8) Stubb observing
him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness
to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.

Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled(43,10)(263,10) as
the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The
involuntary consternation(856,8)moment caused(338,8)leap, paddle in
hand, out(910,8)boat; and in such a way, that par(42,9)slack whale
line coming(1369,9)his chest, he breasted it overboar(708,12)so as
(824,10)entangled in i(1372,8)at last plumping into the water. That
instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly
straightened; and presto!(399,9) came all foaming up(1146,8)chocks of
(599,8), remorselessly dragged there(1447,8)line, which had taken
several turns around(351,10) and neck.

Tashtego stood(1250,8)bows. He was ful(1403,9)fire(1415,8)hunt. He
hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching(812,9)-knife from its sheath, he
(1898,10)its sharp edge over(237,11)and turning towards Stubb,
exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face
plainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than
half a minute, this entire thing (978,8).

“Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so(1376,10) was lost and(1552,8)
saved.

So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by
yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these
irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,
but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,
un(29,10) gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never
jump from a boat, Pip, except—but all the rest was indefinite, as the
soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick(1058,8)boat_, is your
true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from(1134,9)_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving(1368,9)that if
he should give undiluted conscientious(243,8)to Pip, he would be
leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly
dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, “(370,8)(1414,11)Pip, or(1394,8)Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind
that. We can’t afford to lose whales(1482,10)kes of you; a(1003,8)ould
sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in
mind, and don’t jump any more.” Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,
that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,
which propensity too often interferes(2028,8)s benevolence.

But we are all(1715,8)hands(1703,8)Gods;(1310,9)jumped again. It was
under very similar circumstances(1944,8)first performance; but this
time he did not breast out(1948,9); and hence, when(1479,11)started
to run,(1482,8) left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller’s
trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word(262,8) a beautiful,
bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly
stretching away, all round,(1220,8)horizon, like gold-beater’s skin
hammered out(1273,8)extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s
ebon head showed(315,9)ead of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when
he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him;
and(1981,15)winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless
ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out(1952,11)entre(784,8)sea, poor
Pip(161,8)his crisp, curling, black head(1654,8)sun, another lonely
castaway,(1032,8)the loftiest (239,8)brightest.

(1755,8)calm weather, to swim(963,8)open ocean is as easy to the
practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful
lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the
middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,
how when sailors in a dead calm bathe(285,13)sea—mark how closely
they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.

But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro(1090,8)fate? No;
(1276,11)mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,
and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip
very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations
towards oarsmen jeopardized thr(747,8)ir own timidity, is not always
manifested(2011,8)hunters in all(1648,9)instances; and such(20,10)
not unfrequently occur; almost invariably(1794,8)fishery, a coward, so
called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to
military navies and armi(583,9)it so happened(434,9)ose boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly
spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and
(1424,8)boat was now so far(1676,8)nd he and all his crew so intent
upon his fish, that Pip’s ringed(1725,8) began to expand around him
miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
b(1481,10)at hour the(907,14)went about the deck an idiot; such,
(906,8), they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body
up, but drow(1052,8)infinite of his soul. No(38,10)entirel(1572,9).
Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of
the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes(1938,10)miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the
joyous,(1534,10), ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,
God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out(2000,8)firmament of waters
heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the treadle of the
loom, and spoke it;(1999,8)r(332,10)shipmates called him mad. So
man’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,
man comes(804,9)to that celestial thought, which, to(63,8) is
absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,
indifferent as his God.

For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that
fishery; and(2020,8)sequel(485,8)narrative, it will then be seen what
like(1976,8)ment befell myself.


CHAPTER 94. A Squeez(497,8) Hand.

That whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
Pequod’s side(960,8)all those cutting and hoisting op(1916,9)previously detailed, were regularly gone(1929,8), even to the baling(1056,8)Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.

While some were occupi(1814,10)is latter duty, others were employed in
dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as fill(1910,13)perm; and
when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated
ere going(271,8)try-works, of which anon.

It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with
several others, I sat down(1392,8)a large Constantine’s bath of it, I
found it(1506,8)ly concreted into lumps, here(1156,10) rolling about
in the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back
into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this
(421,10)such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer!(364,8)sweetener!
(18,8)often(35,11)delicious molifier! After having my hands in it
for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it
were, to serpentine and spiralise.

As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed(315,9)
(2010,8)ose soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost
within the hour; as they richly broke to(397,11), and discharged all
their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that
uncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like the smell of spring
violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky
meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath;(1833,8) inexpressible
sperm, I was(443,12) and my heart of it; I almost began to credit
the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in
allaying the heat of anger; while bathing(198,9)bath, I felt divinely
free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort
whatsoever.

Squeeze!(1256,8)(9,9)! all the morning long; I(1298,8)d(238,11)
till I myself(318,8)mel(1430,9)it(59,23) till a
strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found(110,8)unwittingly
squeezing my co-laborers’(1252,12), mistaking their hands(651,8)
(956,15)(1406,8)n abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving
feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continual(201,13)(162,11), and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as
much as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish
any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;
let us(1876,9)hands all round; nay, let us all(1917,9)ourselves into
each other;(46,8)(42,18)universally(296,9) very milk and
sperm of kindness.

Would that I could keep (401,12)(997,9)for ever! For now, since
by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceiv(853,8)in all
cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of
attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the
fancy; but(35,8)wife,(1222,8)rt, the bed, the table, the saddle, the
fireside, the country; now(368,8)(268,15)all this, I am ready
to(576,9)case eternally. In thoughts of the vision(15,9)night, I
saw long rows(1414,8)ls in paradise, each with his(1090,10)a jar of
spermaceti.

Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things
akin to it,(399,8)business of prepar(1602,8)sperm whale(1213,9)try-works.

First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
part(337,8)fish, and also(45,11)hicker port(370,8)his flukes. It
is tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some
oil. After being sever(186,12)wha(641,8)(248,11) is first cut
into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like
blocks of Berkshire marble.

Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary par(706,9)
whale’s flesh, here and there adher(175,11)blanket of blubber, and
often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is
a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name
imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked
snowy and golden ground, dotted with spo(1039,10)deepest crimson and
purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,
it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I
stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should
conceive a royal cutlet(938,13)gh of Louis le Gros might have
tasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the
venison season, and that particular (36,14) contemporary with an
unusually fine vintage(1501,10)neyards of Champagne.

There is another substance, and a very singular one(1290,8)turns up in
the course of this(1421,9), but which I feel it to be very puzzling
adequately to describ(623,9)called slobgollion; an appellation
original with(1247,10)men, and even so(1124,8)natur(291,9)(249,9).
It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the
tubs(1749,11)after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I
hold(307,10)the wondrously thin, ruptured membrane(2006,9)case,
coalescing.

Gurry(1754,13)is a term properly belonging to right(332,11)but
sometimes incidentally used by(1909,11)fishermen. It designates the
dark, glutinous(638,10)(1902,10)scraped off the back(1522,8)Greenland or(166,12), and much of which covers the decks of those
inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.

Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous(1823,8)whale’s
vocabulary. But as applied by(689,11)it becomes so. A whaleman’s
nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cu(1238,12)apering
part of(219,10)’s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the
rest, is about the siz(1148,9)iron (108,8)a hoe. Edgewise moved along
the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless
blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.

But to learn all(216,10)se recondite matters, your best way is at
once(1222,8)end into the blubber-room, and have a long talk(153,8)s
inmates. This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for
the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted(1789,10)whale. When the
proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a
scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by
a dull lantern, a sp(285,8)been left clear(678,8) workmen. They
generally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The
whaling-pike is similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon(1643,9)ame
name. The gaff is something(751,8)boat-hook. With his gaff, the
(161,8)hooks on to a sheet of(617,8), and strives to (1615,8)from
slipping,(570,8)ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the
(279,9) stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into
the portable horse-piec(763,9)spade is sharp as hone can make it;(143,10)man’s feet are shoeless; the thing he(176,11)will (1743,9)
irresistibly slide away from him,(1165,8)sledge. If he cuts off one of
his own toes, or one of his assistants’, would you be very much
astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran(1106,13) men.


CHAPTER 95. The Cassock.

Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
post-mortemizing(1512,8)whale; and h(101,9)rolled forward nigh the
windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which(89,17)een
there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous
cistern(46,8)whale’s huge head; not the prodigy(525,8)unhinged lower
jaw(43,10)miracl(568,9)symmetrical tail; non(1896,8)se would so
surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,—longer than
a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and
jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it
is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such(73,8) as that
found(460,8)secret groves(133,8)n Maachah in Judea; and for
worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose h(1402,8)destroyed the
idol, and burnt it for an abomination(329,9)rook Kedron, as darkly
set forth(667,8)15th chapter(1636,8)First Book of Kings.

Look(424,8)sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and
assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus(1630,9)mariners
call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a
grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the
forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt,
as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns(38,9)
inside out(1643,9)pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as
almost to double its(937,9); and at last hangs it, well spread, in
the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some
three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two
slits for arm-holes(1134,8)other end, he(1463,12)slips himself
bodily into it. T(750,9) now stands before you investe(1075,9)full
canonicals(1995,8)calling. Immemorial to all his order, this
investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employ(135,9)
peculiar function(138,9)office.

That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,
planted endwise against the bulwarks(1022,11)a capacious tub beneath
it, into which(1188,10)d pieces drop, fast(1124,8)sheets from a rapt
orator’s desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit;
intent on bible leaves; what a candidate(1492,9)rchbishopric, what a
lad for a Pope were this mincer!*

*B(96,11)! (14,14)This is the invariable cry(1261,10)mates
to(1494,11). It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as
thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so do(609,8)business of
boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably
increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.


CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.

Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly
distinguished by her try-works. She presents the(807,9)anomaly of the
most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the
completed ship. It is as if(1788,10)open field a brick-kiln were
transported to her planks.

The(214,10) are (985,8)between the foremast and mainmast, the most
roomy part of the deck. The timbers(1010,8) are of a (1258,9)strength,
fitted to sustain the weight of an al(338,14)s of brick and
mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The
foundation does not penetrate(217,9), but the(467,9)is firmly
secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
sides, and screwing it down(88,8)timbers. On the flanks it is cased
with wood, and at top (591,8)ly covered by a large, sloping, battened
hatchway. R(2041,8)this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in
number, and each of several barrels’ capacity. When not in use, they
are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone
and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. Dur(915,8)night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil
themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them—one
man in each pot, side by side—many confidential communications are
carried on, over the iron lips(1137,9) place also for profound
mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand(544,8)(1067,8)Pequod,
with the(430,10) diligently circling round me, that I was first
indirectly struck by the(563,10)e fact, that in geometry all bodies
gliding along the cycloid, my(157,11)for example, will descend from
any point in precisely the same time.

(853,11)e fire-board(2026,10)fron(1367,9)(1665,9), the bare
(1623,8)of that side is exposed,(1217,10)d(272,8)two iron mouths of
the furnaces, (328,9)underneath the pots. These(60,8)are fitt(1138,8)heavy door(1251,9). The intense hea(1575,9)fire is prevented
from(678,12)ng itself(1362,8)deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
extending under the entire inclosed(1436,9)of the works. By a tunnel
inserted at the rear, this(107,10) is(1176,8)plen(1142,11)water as
fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct
(2031,9)rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.

It was about nine o’clock at night that(913,11)’s(622,10) were
first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee
the business.

“All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the
works.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting
his shavings(1457,9)(788,8) throughout the passage. Here be it said
(1114,8)a whaling voyage(992,8)st fire(1302,8)(355,10)has to be fed
for a time (1992,9). After that no wood is used, except as a(795,9)
quick ignition(835,8)staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,
the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still
contains considerable of its unctuous propertie(1125,9)(72,8) feed
the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming
misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by
(26,8)body. Would that he consumed(63,9)smoke! for his smoke is
horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you
must live in it(749,9)time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor
about it, such as may lurk(1986,8)vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells
like(2033,10)wing(2025,8)day of judgment; it is an argumen(188,9)
pit.

By mid(1182,8)e (1164,10) in full operation. We were clear(1856,9)
carcase; sail(1016,10)made; the wind was freshening(25,8)ld ocean
darkness was(1737,8). But that (31,13)licked up(1902,8)fierce
flames, which at intervals forked forth(2042,10)sooty flues, and
illuminated every lofty rop(1105,9)rigging, as with the famed Greek
fire. The(817,9)ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing(450,9)ir(518,10)harbors, with broad
sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigat(346,8)folded them in conflagrations.

The(1684,8)removed(423,10)top(738,8)works, now afforded a wide
hearth in front of them. Standing(1873,9)were the Tartarean shapes of
the pagan harpooneers, always(1220,10)-ship’s stokers. With huge
pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of(1509,8)(1807,10)scalding
pots, or stirred up(1763,8)es beneath, till the snaky flames darted,
curling, ou(274,8) doors to catch them(841,9)eet. The smoke rolled
away in sullen heaps. To every pitch(1156,8)ship there was a(30,9)
the boiling oil(936,8)seemed all eagerness to leap(279,9)ir faces.
Opposite the mout(122,9)works, on the further side(574,9)ide wooden
hearth, was(1189,9)lass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the
watch, when not otherwise employed, looking(484,10)red hea(676,8)
fire(458,10)ir eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny
feature(793,8)ll begrimed with smoke and sweat,(1013,8)atted beards,
and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were
strangely reveal(188,9) capricious emblazonin(1199,9) works. As they
narrated to each other their unholy adventures(212,8)tales of terror
told in words of mirth; as(74,9)civilized laughter(1583,8)upwards
(829,10)m, (1919,9)flames(1614,10)furnace; as to and fro,(442,9)
front, the(1116,12) wildly gesticulat(439,8)their huge pronged
forks and dippers(202,8) wind howled on, (462,8)sea leaped(20,9)
ship groaned and div(32,8)yet steadfastly shot her red hell(858,8)
and(870,9)(1215,9)blacknes(470,9)sea(140,9)night, and scornfully
champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on
all sides; then the rushing Pequod, (1831,10)with savages, and laden
with fire, and(1984,9)a corpse, and plung(976,11)at(246,13)
darkness,(1243,8)the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s
soul.

So(1315,8)it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently
guid(358,8)ay of this fire-ship(1337,8)sea. Wrapped, for that
interval, in (227,8) myself, I but the better saw(1259,8)ness, the
ma(13,10) ghastli(556,8)others. The continual sigh(1721,9)fiend
shapes before me, capering half in(1264,11)(18,8)fire, these at
last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to
that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a
midnight helm.

But that(809,8)in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)
thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was
horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller
smote my side(2028,8)leaned against it; in my ears(1931,9)low hum of
sails, just beginning to shake(1625,8)wind; I thought my eyes were
open; I was half(212,14)putting my fingers to the lids and
mechanically stretching them sti(1299,10) apart. But, spite of all
this, I could see no compas(715,11) to steer by; though it seemed
but a minute since I had been wa(152,10) card, by the steady binnacle
lamp illuminating it. Nothing(1205,8)(149,10)but a jet gloom, now and
then mad(972,8)y by flashes of(1020,8). Uppermost(483,9)impression,
that whatever swift,(1468,9)thing(1261,9)on was not so much bound to
any haven ahead as(1537,9)from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered
feeling, as of death, ca(956,10). Convulsively my hands grasped the
tiller, but(1996,9) crazy conceit that th(817,8) was, somehow, in
some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is(1637,8)ter with me?
(784,8)I. Lo! in my(1016,8)leep I had turned myself about, and was
front(599,8)ship’s stern, with my back to her prow(2032,9)compass. In
an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying
up(1912,8)e wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how
grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination(1670,8)night,(769,8) fatal contingency of being brought(903,8)lee!

Look not too long(1221,8)face(1770,10)re, O man! Never dream(588,8)y
hand(1970,8)helm! Turn not th(403,10)(390,11); accept(97,8)st
hin(1885,9)hi(1239,8)iller; believe not the artificial fire, when its
redness makes all things look(1052,8). To-morrow,(1464,8)(360,8)sun,
the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils(318,9)orking
flames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the
glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp—all others but liars!

Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome’s
accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. T(163,17)the ocean,
which(1130,8)dark side of this earth, and (42,10)wo thirds(39,8)
earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow
in him(57,18)cannot be true—not true, or undeveloped. With
books the same. The truest of all men(1716,9)Man of Sorrows,(1254,8)
(50,14)books is Solomon’s, and Ecclesiastes(1456,8)fine hammered
steel of woe. “All is vanity.” ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold
of unchristian(136,10) wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and
jails(1542,8)lks fast crossing graveyard(36,8)ould rather talk of
operas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils
all of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais
as passing wise(447,9)refore jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit
down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
wondrou(546,9).

But eve(429,9), he says, “the man that wandereth ou(1467,9)way of
understanding shall remain” (_i.e._, even while living) “in the
congreg(1773,13)dead.” Gi(1545,9)yself up, then, to fire, lest it
invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom
that is woe; but t(35,11)oe (32,8)madness. A(464,8) is a
Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest
gorg(487,8)soar(377,11)m again and become invisible(2006,8)sunny
spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorg(1304,8)gorge is
in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop(48,13) eagle
is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.


CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.

Had you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to(26,13)
forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
moment you would have almost thought you were (818,9)in some
illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors(707,8)they lay
in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a
score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.

In merchantmen, oil(884,9)sailor is more scarce than the milk of
queens. To dress(714,8)dark, and eat(21,18)stumble in
darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he
seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an
Aladdin’s lamp, and lays him(1011,8) it(843,10)in the pitchiest night
the ship’s black hull(841,8)ouses an (571,9)ion.

See with what entire freedom(243,13) t(186,9)handful of
lamps—often but old bottles and vials, though—to the copper cooler at
the(879,10), and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He
burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and,(1894,10),
unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral
contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He
goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and
genuineness, even as the traveller (1344,8)rairie hunts up his own
supper of game(1355,13)8. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.

Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
descri(1430,12)mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,
and slaughtered(1774,8)valleys of the deep(84,12)then towed
alongside and beheaded; and how ((324,9)inciple which entitled the
headsman of old(1612,8)garments in which the(100,9) was killed) his
great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in
due time,(320,8)ondemne(150,9)pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed thr(1953,8)
fire;—but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of
the description by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding
of decanting off(880,8) in(1203,8)asks and striking the(1439,9)to the
hold, where once again(741,11)return(1654,9)native profundities,
sliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to
rise and blow.

While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received(219,10)six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, (1667,8) is pitching and rolling
this way and(1741,13)midnight sea, the enormous(380,8)re slewed
round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot
across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last
man-handled and stay(1125,9)ir course; and all round the hoops, rap,
rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, _ex officio_,
every sailor is a cooper.

At length, when(851,10)pint is casked,(168,9)is cool, then the
great hatchways are unsealed, the bowel(1362,9)ship are thrown open,
and down g(849,12)to their final res(529,9)sea. This done, the
hatches are replac(187,8)hermetically close(1220,8)a closet walled up.

In the sperm fishery, this is(719,8) one(1575,8)most remarkable
incid(1473,8)all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream
with freshets of blood and oil;(1955,8)sacred quarter-deck(796,9)
masse(1741,9)whale’s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie
about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke(1934,10)try-works has besooted
(264,10)lwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the
entire ship seems great(1352,11)himself; while on all hands the din
is deafening.

But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this
self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and(312,10),
you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a
most scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil
possesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the
decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of
oil. Besides,(614,10)ash(731,10)burned scrap(752,14), a
potent lye is readily made(1704,8)enever any adhesiveness(724,10)back
(840,12) remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly
exterminates it. Hands go diligently along(805,13), and with
buckets of water and rags restore them(1333,11)ull tidiness. The soot
is brushed(947,10)lower rigging. All the numerous implements which
have been in use are likewise faithful(559,9)ed and put away. T(1595,14) is scrubb(42,8)laced(1758,9)(796,11) completely
hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in
unseen nooks(530,10) by the combin(1993,8)imultaneous industry of
almost the (1185,11)’s company, the whole of this conscientious duty
is at last concluded(1902,10) crew themselves proceed(1834,10)own
ablutions; shift(49,12)from top to toe; and finally issue to the
immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from
out the daintiest Holland.

Now, with elated step, they pace(1812,12)in twos and threes, and
humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets,(239,8)e cambrics;
propose to mat the deck; think of having ha(1001,13)top; object not
to taking tea by moonlight(1964,8)piazza(1935,8)forecastle. To hint to
such musked(1821,10)of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short
of audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and
bring us napkins!

But mark: aloft there, a(90,8)ree mast heads, st(438,9) men intent
on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil
the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot
somewhere. Yes; and many(1747,8)time, when, after the severest
uninterrupted labor(195,8)(372,8) night; continuing straight through

Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with
thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage—and, foolish as I am, taught

CHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.

Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in
the multiplicity of other things requiring narration(189,8)not been
added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,
he(251,15)use in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely
eye(1275,8)particular object before him. When he halted(27,8)the
(307,8), with his glance fastened(1796,8)pointed needle in(1645,8)pas(739,8)glance shot like a javelin with(72,13)intensity of
his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paus(202,14)(496,8), then, as the same riveted(219,17)upon th(33,9)
gold coin there, he still wore(81,10)aspect of nailed firmness, only
dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.

But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
at(1536,8)by th(563,9) figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
though now for the first time begin(152,8)interpret for himself in
some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some
(319,8)(50,13)lurks in all things, else(17,11) are little
worth,(1751,8) round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell
by the cartload(614,8)y do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass
in the Milky Way.

Now(1767,8)ubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of
the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands,(71,8)d-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And (554,11)nailed amidst
all the rustiness of iron bolts(396,9)verdigris of copper spikes,
yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its
Quito glow. Nor,(182,8)placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour
passed by(39,10)hands(600,8)rough the livelong nights shroud(1967,10)ick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless
every sunrise found(1055,13) whe(1205,8)unset left it last. For it
was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however
wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as
the white whale’s talisman. S(1895,9)they talked it over in the weary
watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last,(1651,8)ther he
would ever live to spend it(939,9)ose noble(829,8)coins of South America are as medals of(400,8)
and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s
disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,
are in luxuriant profusion(1560,8); so that the precious gold seems
almost to derive an added(46,9)ness and enhancing glories, by
passing(837,11)ose fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.

It so chanced(165,10)(1351,9)of the Pequod was a most wealthy
example of these things. On its round border it bore the letters,
REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country
planted(719,8)midd(150,9) world, and beneath the great equator, and
named after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the
unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by thos(267,9) you saw the
like(1526,8)three Andes’ summits; from one a flame; a tower on another;
on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segmen(1818,9)partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual
cabalistic(1515,9)e keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at
Libra.

Before this(441,8)ial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
pausing.

“There’s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and
all other grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as
Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the(1225,8)(27,19)
courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too,(99,10)all
are(14,8)nd thi(969,8)gold is but the imag(871,9)rounder globe,
which, like a magician’s glass, to each and every man in turn but
mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for
those who ask(1037,10) to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks
now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the
sign of storms,(750,11)x! and but six months before he wheeled out
of a former(62,8) at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born
in throes, ’tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So
(89,11)! Here’s stout stuff for woe to work on.(144,16)”

“No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’s claws must
have left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to
himself, leaning against the bulwarks. “The old man seems to read
Belshazzar’s awful writing. I have never(1330,8)the coin inspectingly.
He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty,
heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint
earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over
all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a
hope. If we bend down our eyes, the(275,9)e shows her mouldy soil;
but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to
cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we
would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!
T(1167,8) speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but(347,8)adly to me. I will
quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”(1835,8) now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he’s
been twigging it(1635,8)ere goes(908,10)from the same, and both with
faces which I(1199,8)say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long.
And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did(961,8)it now on
Negro Hill or in Corlaer’s Hook, I’d not look at it very long ere
spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as
queer(1123,9)seen doubloon(1613,9)now in my voyagings; your(43,10)
of old Spain,(29,15) of Peru(24,20)Chili, your
(49,13)Bolivia(76,21)opayan; with plenty(375,8)
moidores and pistoles, and jo(10,8)half(15,11)quarter joes. What

wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the
zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I’ll get the(40,9)and
as(1685,8)heard devils can be raised with Daboll’s arithmetic, I’ll try
my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues (933,9) the
Massachusetts calendar. Here’s the book. Let’s see now. S(354,16)(1114,9) sun, he’s always among ’em. Hem, hem, hem; here they
are—(14,9) go—all alive:—Aries, or the Ram; Tauru(20,10)Bull and
Jimimi(520,9)Gemini himself(67,9)Twins. Well;(1825,9)he wheels
(176,11)Aye, here on the coin he’s just crossing the threshold
between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there;
the fact is, you books must know your places. You’ll do to give us the
bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That’s my
small experience, so far as the (588,22), an(866,10)’s
navigator, and(744,20) go(610,11) wonders, eh? Pity if
there is nothing (1072,9) in signs, and (1486,12)in(77,8)!
There’s a clu(1729,11); wait a bit; hist—hark! By Jove,(1685,10)!
Look you, Doubloo(1475,8)zodiac (165,8)the life of man in one round

Almanack! To begin: there’s (831,17)—lecherous dog, he begets
us; then,(865,20)—he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini,
(872,12)—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo!
comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from(80,8)
Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few fierce bites and
surly dabs with his paw; we escape(1827,8)il Virgo, the Virgin! that’s
our first love; we marry and think to be happy for ay(277,8)pop comes
Libra(1301,9)Scales—happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we
are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio(1430,8)
Scorpion, stings u(349,9)rear; we are cur(1327,8)wound, when whang
come the arrows all round; Sagittari(1526,11)Archer, is amusing
himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside(1578,9)the
battering-ram, Capricorn(1641,11)Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing,
and headlong(246,8)tossed; when Aqu(200,14)Water-bearer, pours
out his whole deluge and drowns u(1905,8)o wind up with Pisc(1837,10)
Fishes, we sleep. (1271,10)sermon now, writ in high heaven,(2001,8)
sun goes through it every ye(1504,8)yet comes(1186,8)it (1987,9) and
hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheel(101,10)toil and trouble; and
so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word(837,8)! Adieu,
(1453,8)! But stop; her(460,8)little King-Post; dodge round the
try-works, now, and let’s hear what he’ll have to say. There; he’s
before it; he’ll out with something presently. So, so; he’s beginning.”

“I see(1800,9)here, but a(177,9)ing made of gold, and whoever raises
a certain whale, this(67,13)belongs to him. So, what’s all this
staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that’s true; and at
two cents the cigar(41,9)nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won’t
smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars,(1602,9)’s nine
(99,18)of them; so here goes Flask(714,8)o spy ’em out.”

“Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a
foolish look to it; yet,(55,17)(85,9)then has it a sort of
wise(72,14). But, avast(773,13)our old Manxman—the old
hearse-driver, he must have been, (2033,9)before he took to the sea.
He luffs up(39,8)the doubloon; halloa, and goe(649,8)on the other
side of the mast; why, t(1251,9)horse-shoe nailed on that side; and
now he’s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he’s muttering—voice
like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick e(619,9)listen!”

“If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when
the sun stands in some on(289,8)se signs. I’ve studied signs, and know
their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch
in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will (181,8)then be? The(436,11)
sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And(1168,8)the
(510,11)sign? The lion is t(107,13) sign—the roaring and
devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.”

“(1908,9)nother rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in
one kind of world, you see. Dodge again!(1739,12)Queequeg—all
tattooing—looks like the signs(842,8)Zodiac himself. What says the
Cannibal? As I live he’s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;

suppose, as(637,10)omen talk Surgeon’s Astronomy(68,9)ack country.
And by Jove, he’s found(1926,11)there(162,8)vicinity of(215,10)—I

he had died, or I; he’s half horrible to me. He too has been watching
all(1427,10)interpreters—myself included—and look now, h(446,9)o

Hark!”

“I look, you look, he looks; we(29,8)(9,8)they look.”

“Upon my soul, he’s been studying Murray’s Grammar! Improving his mind,
poor fellow! But(1479,10)at he says now—hist(181,65)Why, he’s getting it by heart—hist! again.(106,65)ell, that’s funny.”

“And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I’m a
crow, especially when I stand a’top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw!

he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old (1188,8), and two more
poked into the sleeves of(1267,8)jacket.”

“Wonder if he means me?—complimentary!—poor lad!—I could go hang
myself. Any way, for the present, I’ll quit Pip’s(1526,9). I can stand

sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.”

CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.

The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.

“Ship, ahoy! Hast seen(717,16)?”

So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,
bearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was
standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to
the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclin(114,11)own boat’s
bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of
sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round
him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm(1948,9)jacket
streamed behind him like the broidered(58,8)a hussar’s surcoat.

“(580,29)“See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,
he held up a white(205,8)sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden
head like a mallet.

“Man my boat!”(751,13)impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
him—“Stand by to lower!”

In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
crew were dropp(1730,10)water, and were soon alongside of the
(764,8). But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the
excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his
leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his
own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical
contrivance peculiar(341,8)(1374,8)and a thing not to be rigged and
shipped in any other(182,11)a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very
easy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it,
like whalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea;(1916,9)great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,
(415,10)nstantaneously drop it half way down(717,8)kelson. So,
deprived of one leg(502,9)(1484,8) ship of course being altogether
unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly
reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hop(1604,8)eyeing the uncertain
changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.

It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every(1083,8)untoward
circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
luckless mishap,(636,8)invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And
in the(1115,8) instance, all this was heightened by the sigh(1134,8)
two officers(1154,8)(517,12), leaning over the side, by the
perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging(736,9)him a
pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem
to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to
use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted(1674,10)
because(857,13)captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,
cried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys(368,11)
(445,9)cutting-tackle.”

As good luck would have it, they had had a whale(1797,11)a day or two
previous(1101,10)great tackles were still aloft(1141,10)massive
curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was(73,8)ttach(1973,10)end.
T(763,8)quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,
slid his solitary thigh into the curve(1971,8)hook (it was like sitting(932,8)fluke of an anchor, or the crotch(28,8)pple tree)(1930,10)
gi(481,8) word, hel(1358,10)fast, and at the same time also helped to
hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon on(231,9)running
part(1069,9)tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high
(1743,9) and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm
frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other(886,8) advanced, and Ahab,
putting out(97,11)(1814,9)cross(1655,8)(125,9) (like two
sword-fish blades) (947,9) in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let
us shake bones (1898,8)!—an arm and a leg(18,9)that never can
shrink, d’ye see;(51,10)(43,15) run. Where did’st thou see
the White Whale?—how long ago?”

“T(34,14),” said the Englishman, pointing(437,14)(1526,8)
the E(698,9)taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a
telescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”

“And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from
(675,11), and resting(123,8)(268,10)’s shoulder, as he did so.

“Aye,(823,8)the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”

“Spin me the yarn(396,8)Ahab; “how was it?”

“It(102,9)first time in my life that I ever cruised(329,13)”

Well, one day we(1442,9)for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat
fastened to(1191,11)m; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went
milling and (12,8)round s(40,8)my boat’s crew could only trim dish,
by(1527,8) all their sterns(656,8)outer gunwale. Presently up breaches
from the bottom(1637,8)sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white
head and hump, all crows’ feet and wrinkles.(542,11)he, i(11,8)!” cri(777,9)suddenly le(1331,14)suspended
breath.(869,8)arpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”(781,8)aye—they were mine—_my_ irons,(146,14)exultingly—“but on!”

“Give me a chance, the(798,9)(1194,16)good-humoredly. “Well,
this old great-grandfather, with the white (364,15)runs all
afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!(1059,8)I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know
him.”

“How(481,8)exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do not
know; but in bit(1821,8)line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there
someh(72,8)we didn’t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled
on(123,11)bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead(1189,8)other
whale’s;(1046,10) off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters
sto(480,8)what a noble(937,12) it was—the noblest and biggest I
ever saw, sir,(1437,11)—I resolved to capture him, spit(1278,8)
boiling rage he seemed to be in. And think(440,8)hap-hazard line would
get loose, or the tooth(1053,8)tangled to might draw (for I have a
devil of a(1342,13)for a pull on a whale-line); see(1345,10)is, I
say, I jumped into my first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the
way, Captain—(37,8);(47,9)—the captain);—as I was saying(126,10)

mine, then; and snatch(838,8)first(1338,8), let (1162,8)
(1162,17) have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls
alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes
out—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail
looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble
steeple. No use sterning all(358,8)but (468,9)groping at midday,
with a blinding sun(1842,10)n-jewels;(67,17), I say, after
the second iron, to toss it overboard—down comes the tail(210,8)Lima
tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,
flukes first,(1704,12)ump backed through the wreck, as thoug(997,8)
all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I
seized hold of my(730,8)-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung
to that(507,8)sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at
the same(750,10)the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down
like a flash; and the barb of that cursed(523,12) towing along near
me(1808,8)me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes,

ript its way alo(1229,8)lesh—clear(22,11)whole length of my

will tell you the rest(1542,8) way,(1511,8)—Dr. Bunger, ship’s surgeon:
(24,8)my lad,(1567,13). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part(1930,8)yarn.”

The professional(182,13)us familiarly pointed out, had been all
the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote
his(308,10)ly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but
sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and
patched trows(1211,8) had(277,8)r been divid(789,8)attention between
a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box(33,9)the other,
occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
crippled(610,8)s. But, at his superior’s introduction of him to Ahab,
he politely bowed, and(1831,9)way went on to do his(725,8)’s bidding.

“It was a shocking bad wound,” began (1943,9)-surgeon; “and(1298,9)my
advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”

“Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-armed
captain, addressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”

“S(132,18) off to the northward, to get ou(933,8) blazing
hot weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat
up with him nights; was very severe(33,10)in the matter of diet—”

“Oh,(51,12)!” chime(696,9)patient himself; then suddenly
alter(1610,8)voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till
he couldn’t see to put(283,8)bandages; and sending me to bed, half
seas over, about three o’clock(260,9)orning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up
(165,8)inde(788,8)(345,16)in my diet. Oh! a great watcher,
and very dieteticall(407,8), is (1557,10). ((1566,8)you dog, laugh
out! why don’t ye? You know you’re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave
ahead, boy, I’d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other
man.”

“My(1753,8), you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said the
imperturbable godly-looking(1836,10)lightly bowing(1209,8)—“is apt to
be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But
I may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I myself—that
is to say, Jack(2037,9)late(1472,8)reverend clergy—am a strict total
abstinence man; I never drink—”

“Water!” cried the(1545,8); “he(47,12)s it; it’s a sort of fits to
him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with
the arm story.”

“Yes, (339,13),” (507,8) surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing,
sir, before(1555,15)’s(503,11)(1497,9)ion, that spite of my
best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse;
the truth was, sir,(1446,8)as ugly gaping wound as(231,8) ever saw;
more than two fee(152,11)al inches long. I measured it with the lead
line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threaten(2016,8)off it
came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is
against all rule”—pointing at(189,13)marlingspike—“that is the(1922,8)’s work, not mine; he order(744,9)rpenter to make it; he had
that club-hamm(1887,9)put(1953,8)end, to knock some one’s brains out
with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical
passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir”—remov(1857,8)hat, and
brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,
but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever
having been a wound—“Well,(1146,12) there will tell you how that
came here; he knows.”

“No, I don’t(1058,12)(1632,9)“but his mother did; he was born with
it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another
Bunger in the watery world?(1682,9)when you die, you ought to die in
pickle(1994,9); you should be preserved to future ages, you(1980,8)”

“What becam(1594,9)White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.

“Oh(1643,13)one-armed(423,11)oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we
didn’t see him again for some time; in fact, as I(1531,8)hinted, I(67,8)then kno(1252,8)hale(1422,8)that had served me such a trick,
till(115,10) afterwards, when coming back(1078,8)Line, we heard about
Moby Dick—as some call him—and then(1418,8)it was he.”

“Did’st thou cross his wake again?”

“Twice.”

“But could not fasten?”

“Didn’t want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What(648,8)I do without
this other arm? And I’m thinking (233,9) doesn’t bite so much as he
swall(982,8)(1053,9)n,”(1950,10)ed(839,9)“give him your left arm for bait to
get the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically
bowing to each Captain in succession—“(94,22),(1770,8)e
digestive organs(916,8)whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine
Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest
even a man’s(436,10)(1368,8) it too. So that what you take for the
(1101,11)’s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to(501,8) a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But
(1824,9) he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of
mine in Ceylo(434,8)making believe (168,8)jack-knives, once upon a
time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a
twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in
small tacks, d’ye see. No (543,9)way(547,12)digest that
(228,8)fe, and fully incorporate it(222,8)s general bodily system.
Yes,(811,9)Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind
to pawn one(991,9)the sak(1749,9)privilege of giving decent burial
to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let(929,10)
have(2025,8) chance at(1948,8)rtly, that’s all.”

“No, thank ye,(1210,8)” said the(1828,8)(1106,8), “he’s welcome to the
arm he has, since I can’t help(310,9)didn’t know him then; but not to
(188,8)one. No more (964,11)s for me; I’ve lowered(1096,9)once,
and(1824,8)s satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I
know that;(782,12)s a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark
ye, he’s best let alone; don’t you think so(655,9)?”—glancing at the
ivory leg.

“He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What i(133,10)
alon(1440,8)accursed thing is not always what least allures. He’s all a
magnet! How long since thou saw’st him last? Which way heading?”

“Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’s,” cri(1891,11)stoopingly
walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man’s
blood—bring the thermometer!—it’s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes
these planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocke(807,8)rawing
near to Ahab’s arm.

“Avast!” roare(233,8)dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the boat!
(392,22)Good God!(359,8)(1026,21)to whom the question was put.
“What’s the matter? He was(499,8) east, I think.—Is your(1418,8)
crazy?” whispering Fedallah.

But(15,9), putting a finger on his lip, slid over(267,13) to
take(270,9)’s steering oar, a(576,9)swing(525,8)cutting-tackle
towards him, commanded the ship’s sailors to stand by to lower.

In a moment he was standing i(429,10)’s stern(1940,9) Manilla men
were spr(168,8)o their oars. In vain(1482,20) hailed him.
With back to the(809,8)r ship, and face set(849,8)flint to his own,
Ahab stood upright till alongsid(1806,9)Pequod.


CHAPTER 101. The Decanter.

Ere(1667,13)ship fades from sight, be it set down her(1238,8)she
hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,
merchant of that city, the original(2021,8)famous whaling house of
Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman’s opinion, comes not
far behind the united royal houses(352,8)Tudors and Bourbons, in point
of real historical interest.(1478,9), prior(528,8)year of our Lord
1775, this great(246,15)was in existence, my numerous
fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out
the first(548,13)s that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;
though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant
Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket(955,9)Vineyard had in large fleets
pursued that Leviathan, but only(1046,8)North and South Atlantic: not
elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded(806,12)the(169,10)ers were(347,11)among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm
Whale; and that for half a century they were the only peopl(1071,8)
whole globe who s(132,9)(1216,8)
In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia,(567,11) for the express purpose,
and(2017,8)sole charg(1206,9)vigorous(1052,8)s, boldly rounded Cape
Ho(1452,8)was (328,16)the nations(1548,9) a whale-boat of any
sort(1543,8)great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;
and returning to her berth with her hold ful(1223,9)precious sperm,
(326,10)’s example was soon followed by other ships,(1648,9)and
America(1732,9)us the vast(910,12) ground(1224,9)Pacific(658,8)rown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable
house again bestirred itself:(1531,8)and all his Sons—how many, their
mother only knows—and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I
think, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the
sloop-of-war Rattler on a(1671,9)voyage of discovery into the South
Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the(100,9)made a rattling
(103,10)it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this
is not all. In 1819, the same house(971,12)a(213,11)whale ship
of their own, to go on a tasting cruise(1758,8)remote waters of Japan.
That ship—well called the “Syren”—made a noble experimental cruise; and
it was(760,8)at(1318,11)Japanese Whaling Ground first became
generally known. The Syren in this famous(1045,12)c(464,13)
Captain Coffin, a(1525,12).

All hon(2035,10)Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to
the present day; though doubtless the original(883,8)must long ago
have slipped his cable(1463,9)(1294,15)(1439,8)other world.

The ship named after him was worthy(1496,8)honor, being a very fast
sailer and(483,9)craft every way. I boa(1875,8) once at midnight
somewhere of(1236,8)tagonian coas(812,8)rank good flip down in the
forecastle. It was(1766,8)gam we had(1369,8)(1866,8)all trumps—every
soul on board. A short lif(774,8)m, and a jolly death. A(1977,9)ine
gam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his
ivory heel—it minds m(1894,9)noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that
ship; and may my parson forget me(275,9) devil remember me, if I ever
lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Y(1483,8)we flipped it
at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s
squally(558,8)re by(563,10)),(1693,10)ands—visitors(1716,8)—were
(1192,8)o reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that(228,8)to swing each
other aloft in bowlines;(256,8)ignorantly fur(1307,8)skirts of our
jackets(1650,10)sails, so(121,10)ung there, reefed fast(767,8)howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts
did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that
(297,10)pass the flip again,(1262,8)the savage salt spray bursting
down the (987,10) scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to
my taste.

The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was
bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,
symmetrically globular, and indestructible(82,10). I fancied that
you could feel(1248,11)roll them about in you after(1345,10)
swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their
pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’t be
helped; besides,(404,8)an anti-scorbutic; in short, t(84,8)
contained the only fresh fare they had. But(658,16)was not very
light, an(564,8) very easy to step over into a dark corner when you
ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the
dimensions(2044,8)cook’s boilers, including his own live parchment
boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was(1819,9)ship; of
good fare and plenty; fin(1045,8)nd strong; crack fellows all, and
capital from boot heels to hat-band.

But why was it, think ye, that(176,19), and some other
English whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous,(1918,8)ble
ships; that passed round the beef(1909,10)bread(1924,10)can(1937,9)
joke(1606,8)re not soon weary of eating, and drink(14,9)laughing? I
will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these (261,16)is
matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of
(55,11)whale(61,9), when it has seemed needed.

Th(144,11)ere preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
Zea(12,8) and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant
in th(104,9); and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching
plenty to eat(440,10). For, as a general thing, t(257,10)
merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so(55,12) whaler. Hence,(203,8)English, this thing of whal(537,15)is not normal and
natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some
special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further
elucidated.

During my(668,9)es(554,8)Leviathanic(709,8)es, I stumbled upon an
ancient Dutch volume, which,(611,8)musty(302,9)smell of it, I knew
must be about(1106,8). The title was, “Dan Coopman,” w(301,8) I
concluded(1215,8)is (85,8)the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam
cooper(814,8)fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was
reinforc(890,8)is opinion by seeing that(1914,8)the production of one
“Fitz Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,
professor of Low Dutch and High German(1057,8)college of Santa Claus
and St. Pott’s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a
box of sperm candles(1320,8) trouble—this same(222,15)so soon as
he spied the book, assured me that(555,13)” did not mean “The
Cooper,” but “The Merchant.” In short, this (739,8)and(349,9)Low
Dutch book treated of the commerce of(1376,8); and, among other
subjects, contained(452,8)interesting account of its(1477,14).
An(613,10)chapter it was, headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” that I found a
long detailed list(203,8)outfits for the larders and cellars of 180
sail of Dutch whalemen(1599,9)ich list, as(549,9)ed by(712,14)
I transcribe the following:

400,000 lbs. of beef. 6(21,11)Friesland pork. 15(50,14)stock
fish. 5(28,15)biscuit. 72(52,14)oft bread. 2,800 firkins
of butter. 2(154,11)Texel & Leyden cheese. 144(190,10)cheese
(probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of
beer.

Most statistical tables are parchingly dry(1517,8)reading;(1808,8)in
the present case, however, where(56,9)er is flooded with whole
pipes,(160,8), quarts, and gills of good gin and(1862,11).

At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this
beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
(1969,10)ly suggested to me, capable of a transcen(2016,11)Platonic
application; and,(1939,8)more, I compiled supplementary(444,8)of my
own, touching(1588,8)bable quantity(736,9)-fish, etc., consumed by
every(1546,11)harpoone(1784,8)at(1264,9)Greenland and Spitzbergen
(1156,14) I(1841,8)rst place, the am(1209,8)butter, and Texel and
(797,13)(166,9), seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their
naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more(44,10)by the
nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game
in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux
country(869,11)convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of
train oil.

Th(540,14)beer, too, is very large,(1104,15). Now, as those
polar fisheries could only be prosecuted(1107,8)short summer(231,8)
climate, so that the whole cruise of on(390,8)se(1610,15),
includ(766,8)short voyage to and from the(687,12) sea, did not
much exce(1103,9)months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each(543,9)
fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400(865,11)seamen in all; therefore, I
say(57,10)precisely two(1497,11) beer per man, for a twelve weeks’
allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion(629,9)(1623,14)gin.
Now, whether these(1437,9)beer(1068,11)s, so fuddled as one might
fancy them to have been, w(1592,9)ight sort of(352,8)stand up in a
boat’s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem
somewhat im(1317,8). Yet they di(72,9)them, and hit(183,8)o. But
this was very far North, be it remembered(1814,8)beer agrees well with
the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern(1372,8), beer would
be apt to make the(1470,12)sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his
boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.

But no more; enough has been said to show(1000,10)old(975,12)rs of
two or three centuries ago were high livers; and(1079,10)English
(77,8)have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when
cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the
world, get a good dinn(36,10)it, at least. And this empties the
decanter.


CHAPTER 102. A Bow(1956,8)e Arsacides.

Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly
dwelt(666,10)marvels(1094,8)outer aspect; or separately and in detail
upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough
sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
further, and untagg(1601,8)point(227,9)hose, unbuckling his garters,
and casting loose the hooks and the eyes(363,8)j(92,13)innermost
bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say,(961,8)unconditional skeleton.

But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
(1142,9)pretend to know aught about the subterranean part(248,8)
whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures
on the anatomy(703,8)Cetacea; and by help(731,8)windlass, hold up a
specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself(305,9). Can you land a
full-grown whale (191,8)deck for examination, as a cook dishes a
roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,
Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;
(30,17)discoursing(1684,10)joists and beams; the rafters,
ridge-pole, sleepers(861,8)der-pinnings, making up the frame-work of
leviathan; and belike(1191,8)tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and
cheeseries(830,8)bowels.

I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated(2029,9)
beneath the skin(1350,8)adult whale; nevertheless(1364,9)been blessed
with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged
to, a small cub(1483,12) was once bodily hoisted to the(680,10)his
poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barb(1226,9)harpoons, and(35,8)
head(1261,9)lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my
boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and break(1456,8)seal and reading all the
conten(1157,8)at young cub?

And as for my exact knowledg(627,9)bon(1468,10)(669,9) in their
gigantic, full grown development, for that rare(97,11)I am indebted
to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, on(792,9)(2038,11)For being at(44,10)years ago, when attach(522,10)trading-ship Dey
of Algiers, I was invited to spend part(129,16)an holidays with
the lord(186,13)at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side
glen not(899,9) distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his
capital.

Among many other fine qualities, my(392,23)being gift(963,9) devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought
together in(251,8) whatever rare things the more ingenious of his
people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,
chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and
all these distributed among(209,10)natural wonders, the
wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.

Chief among these latter was a great(1308,12), which, after an
unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings
seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of
its fathom-deep enfoldings, and(1249,11)become dust dry in the sun,
t(118,8)skeleton was carefully transported(2004,8)(714,8)glen, where
a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.

The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were(752,9)ith
(1174,11)annals, in strange hieroglyphics;(242,9)kull, the priests
kept up an unextinguished(777,10)flame, so that the mystic (527,10)
sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the
terrific lower jaw vibrated over(1782,8) devotees, like the hair-hung
sword that so affrighted Damocles.

It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as moss(1829,10)Icy Glen;
the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the
industrious earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom, with a gorgeous
carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and
woof(814,10)living flowers the figures. All (243,9)(140,8)ll their
laden branches;(429,9)shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the
message-carrying air(66,9)se unceasingly were active. Through the
lacing(423,9)leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving
the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen(15,8)—pause!—one
word!—whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all
these ceaseless toilings? Speak,(123,9)stay thy hand!—but one single
word with thee! Nay—the(248,9)flies—(487,11) float from forth the
loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god,
(15,8)s; and by that(381,8) is he deafened, that he hears no mortal
voice(67,14)humming, we, too, who look on the loom ar(96,10);
and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak
through it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken
words that are inaudible(2035,10)(691,9)pindles; those same words
are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened
casements. Thereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be
heedful; for so,(257,8)this din(1352,8)great world(1248,9)thy
subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.

Now, amid(998,8)en, life-restless loom of that (1841,11)wood, the
great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet,
as the ever-woven verdant(1386,9) woof intermixed and hummed around
him, the mighty idler(1204,8)the cunning weaver; himself all woven over
(1009,8) vines; every month assuming greener, fresher(1262,8); but
(90,9)(263,9). Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim
god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories(484,8)when with royal Tranquo I visited this(1999,10)whale, and saw the
skull an altar(1778,10)artificial smoke ascend(801,9)where the real
jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an
object of vertu. He laughed. But more(93,22)priests
should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced
before this(750,9)—brushed(576,10) aside—broke (1260,8)the ribs—and
with a ball of(871,12)twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many
winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and
following it back, I emerged(1266,14)ing where I entered. I saw no
living thing within; naught was there but bones.

Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more d(790,9)in the
(871,10)From their arrow-slit in the skull,(521,12) perceived me
taking the altitude(1393,8)final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st
thou measu(544,8)our god! That’s for us.” “Aye,(662,8)—well, how long
do ye make (1245,8)n?” But hereupon a fierce contest ros(1784,11)m,
concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other’s sconces with
their yard-sticks—(1668,10)skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance,
I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.

These(23,15) I now propose to set before you. But first, be it
recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
(153,11) I please. Because there are(1779,10)authorities you can
refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell
me, in Hull, England, on(681,9)whaling ports(1981,9)country, where
they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise,
I have heard tha(873,9)museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they
have w(1442,10)oprietors call “the only perfect(170,9) of a
Greenland or River Whale(1013,8)United States.” Moreover, at a place in
Yorkshire(344,11)Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford
(42,10)has in his possessio(1158,8)eleton of a Sperm Whale, but of
moderate size, by no means(1167,9)ull-grown magn(1195,9)my friend
King(2027,8)’s.

In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two(1754,9)s
belonged, were originally claimed by their(452,13)upon similar
grounds. (158,12)(1074,9)his because he wanted it; and Sir
(360,8),(40,14)s lord(1451,8)seignories of those parts.(68,13)’s whale has been articulated(1963,8)out; so that, like a great
chest of drawers,(1004,8) open and shut him, in all his bony
cavities—spread out his ribs(103,9)igantic fan—and swing all day upon
his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and
shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of
keys at his side.(794,13) thinks of charging twopence for a peep
at the whispering gallery(1988,9)pinal column; threepence to hear the
echo(2038,8)hollow(254,8)cerebellum; and six(133,10)the unrivalled
view from his forehead.

T(967,12)dimensions I shall(1702,8)ceed(1702,8)down are copied
verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished
the other parts of my body to remain a blank pag(503,9)oem I was then
composing—at least, what un(263,8) parts might remain—I did not
trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, shoul(28,8) at all
enter into a congenial admeasurement(1908,12)e.


CHAPTER 103. M(41,14)The Whale’s Skeleton.

In the first place, I wish to lay before you a p(1189,8)r, plain
statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whos(1676,10)
we are briefly to exhibit. Such a (104,9) may prove useful here.

According to a careful calculation I have mad(573,8)hich I partly base
upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons(956,9)largest sized
Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; a(185,12)my(186,8)
(186,11), I say,(1970,14)(1935,8)(120,8)(1932,9), between
eighty-five and nine(131,17), and something less than forty
(177,8)its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh (837,8)
ninety tons(1747,11)reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would
considerably outweigh the combined pop(489,8)of a whole village of one
thousand one hundred inhabitants.

Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle(964,9)be put to
(752,16)to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination?

Having already in various ways put(930,12)his skull, spout-hole,
jaw, teeth, tail,(1614,9), fins, and divers(1350,12),(1619,12)
simply point out what is most interesting(1837,8)general(1029,9)his
unobstructed bone(1511,10)the colossal skull embraces so very large a
propor(492,8)the entire ext(1307,11)(1830,8); as it is by far the
most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it
in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under
your arm, as we(1984,8), otherwise you will not gain a complete notion
of(378,13)structure we are about to view.

I(1028,10)the(1117,12)’s(1439,9) at Tranque measured(1282,8)-two
feet(982,9) when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
been(1184,13)long; for(592,8)whale,(473,13) loses about one
fifth(1374,10) compared(1929,10)(1690,8)ody. Of this(206,17),(843,10) and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fif(1334,8)of plain back-bone. Attached to this(28,10), for(1417,15)
than a third of its(1464,9)was the mighty circular basket of ribs
which once enclosed his vitals.

To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest,(321,11)ong, unrelieved spine,
extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some
twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is(877,10),
(2005,8)time, but a long, disconnected timber.

The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was
nearly six(770,12)the second, third, and fourth were each
successively longer, till you came to the climax(1338,8)fifth, or one(1090,8)middle ribs, which(1019,10)eight feet and some inches. From
that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only
spanned five(111,23)In(1638,9)thickness, they all bore
a seemly correspondenc(269,8)ir length. T(248,14) were the most
arched. In some(1656,8)Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
footpath bridges over small streams.

In considering thes(398,8)I could not but be struck anew(1257,9)
circumstance, so variously(1739,10)(1725,8)book, that(1375,14)of
(1402,9) is by no means the mould of his(1518,10)form. The largest(72,8)(1606,8)ribs, on(326,9)middle ones, occupied (584,9) of the
fish which,(1606,10)is greatest in depth. Now, the(28,10)depth(210,8)(1690,9)body of this particular whal(1695,11) been at least
sixteen feet; whereas, the(614,11)ing rib(1844,10)but(1265,8)more
than(846,11). So(388,8)is rib only conveyed half(950,8)tru(2038,16)living magnitude of(323,10). Besides(1637,10) way, where I
now saw but a nak(1498,9) all that had been once wrapped round with
tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for
the ample fins, I here(160,11)few disordered joints; and in place(701,9)eighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!

How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try
to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his
dead attenuated(933,9), stretch(976,11)peaceful wood. No. Only in
the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his
angry fluke(51,8)on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully
(1065,9)whale be truly and livingly found out.

But the spine. For that, the best way we ca(1336,10) it is, with a
crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now
it’s done, it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar.

There are forty and odd vertebræ in all(1893,8)in(1409,14)are not
locked together. They mostly lie like(1264,10) knobbed blocks on a
Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry(1479,13), a
(1450,10), is in width something less than three feet,(922,8)depth
more than four. The smallest(1170,8)(496,9) tapers away into the
tail, is only two inche(146,10), and looks(157,12)ike a white
billiard-ball. I was told(1802,9)re were still smaller ones, but they
(1302,9)lost by some(1513,8)cannibal urchins, the priest’s children,
who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how(1975,9)
spine of even the hugest of(1565,8)things(339,8)off at last into
simple child’s play.


CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.

From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not
compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and
the yards he measures about the waist; only think(2015,8)gigantic
involution(1407,8) intestines(812,11)y lie in him lik(1033,8)cables
and hawsers coiled(848,8) the subterranean orlop-deck of a
line-of-battle-ship.

Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to
approve myself omnisciently exhaustive(1304,8)(1426,10); not
overlooking the minutest seminal germ(313,9)blood, and spinning him
out to the uttermost coil(57,9)owels. Having already described him
in most(422,8)present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now
remains to magnify him in an archæological, fossiliferous, and
antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creatu(1424,8)the
(432,9)—to an ant or a flea—such portly terms might justly be deemed
unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when(541,10) is the text, the case
is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest
words(860,8)dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been
convenient to consult on(673,9)course of these dissertations, I have
invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased
for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer’s uncommon personal
bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a(1503,8)uthor
like me.

One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of
(1152,14)? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
capitals. Give me a condor’s quill!(26,9)Vesuvius’ crater for an
inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For(1418,8)mere act of penning my
thoughts of(1365,17)they weary me, and make me faint(353,11)
outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole
circl(739,8) sciences, and all the genera(1718,9)whal(35,8)men, and
mastodons, past,(1330,8), and to come, with(88,9)revolving panoramas
of empire on earth, and through(1899,9)hole universe, not excluding
its suburbs. Such, and s(1413,9)ing,(1187,8)virtue of a large and
liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you
must choos(31,11)theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be
written on the flea, though many t(1266,8)who have tried it.

Ere entering upon the(921,8) of Fossil Whales, I(1770,9)my
credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I
have been a stone-mason(612,8)so a great digger of ditches, canals and
wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by
way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader(1601,9)il(1560,8)
earlier(272,8)cal strata there are found the fossils of monsters now
almost completely extinct;(421,8)sequent relics discovered in what are
called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate
intercepted links, between the antichronical creatur(1062,8)those whose
remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark;(1125,9)Fossil
Whales hitherto(244,12)belong to(235,14)period, which is the
last preceding the superficial(287,11). And(848,8)non(2030,8)m
precisely answer to any known species(1337,8)(822,8)time, they are yet
sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking
rank as Cetacean(599,8).

Detached broke(26,9) of pre-adamite(1464,9)fragmen(1663,8)eir bones
and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,
been found at the bas(1632,9)Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England,
in Scotland, and(1874,8)States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull(592,9)n the
year 1779 was disinterre(152,9)Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street
opening almost directly(1434,10)palac(1935,9)Tuileries; and bones
(125,15)excav(1417,8)e(1353,8)ocks of Antwerp, in Napoleon’s
time. Cuvier pronounced these(545,11)(950,8)belonged to some
utterly unknown Leviathanic(795,8).

But by far the most wonderful(1446,8)(721,9)relics was the almost
(1311,8) vast(671,9) of an(1329,8)(1368,8), fou(556,10)year 1842,
(351,8)lantation of Judge Creagh, in(567,9) The awe-stricken
credulous slaves(655,8)vicinity took it for the bones of (1107,10)
fallen angels. The(681,8) doctors declared it a huge reptile, and
bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen(148,9)
it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned
out that this alleged(177,8) was a whale,(1378,8)of a departed
(554,8) A significant illustr(424,9)the fact, again and again
repeat(902,8)is book,(148,8)e(559,13)the whale furnishes but
little clue(1628,8)shape of his fully invested body. So Owen
rechristened the(2018,8) Zeuglodon;(1214,8)his paper read before the
London Geological Society,(924,12)it, in substance,(603,11) most
extraordinary(1959,10) which the mutation(1720,9)globe have blotted
out of existence.

When I stand a(1363,8)se mighty(1022,10)(1599,12)skulls, tusks,
jaws, ribs, and vertebræ, all characterized by partial resemblances to
the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but(1662,8)same time bearing on
the other hand similar affinities(521,8)annihilated antichronical
(1265,9)s, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to
that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said(1428,11)gun; for
time began with man. Here Saturn’s grey chaos rolls over me, and I
obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when
wedged bas(610,9)ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and
in all the 25,000 miles of this world’s circumference, not an
inhabitable hand’s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world
(1666,8)whale’s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the
present lin(188,8)e Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree
like(1883,10)? Ahab’s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh’s.
Methuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I
am horror-struck (1531,9)ntemosaic, unsourced(1091,10)(1793,8)unspeakable terror(1161,9)whale, which, having been(1321,8)all time,
must needs exist after all humane ages are over.

But not alone has this(1207,11)(455,9)pre-adamite trac(2026,9)
stereotype plates of nature,(1507,8)limestone and marl bequeathed his
ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
for them an almost fossiliferous(1361,10), we find the unmistakable
print(1767,9)in. In an apartment(1574,9)reat temple of Denderah, some
fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a
sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins,
and dolphins,(1492,9)to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe
(1872,9)derns. Gliding(1782,10)m, old(1779,12)wam as of yore; was
there swimming in that(210,14)centuries(739,8)Solomon was
cradled.

Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation(2016,8)(577,9)(217,8)whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by
the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.

“Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams
of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
oftentimes cast up dea(669,9)at shore. The Common People imagine,
that by a secret Power bestowed by Go(752,11)(215,8)no Whale can
pass it without immediate death. But the truth(1602,8)Matter is, that
on either sid(1383,8)(328,12)re are Rocks(224,9)ot two Miles into
the Sea, and wound the(333,8)when they light upon ’em. They keep a
Whale’s Rib of an incredible length for a Mirac(1518,9) lying(1055,9)
Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head (551,8)
cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel’s Back. This Rib (says John
Leo) is said to have layn(348,8) hundred Year(969,9)I saw it. Their
Historians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy’d of Mahomet, came from
this(805,9)and some do not stand to assert, that the(100,9)Jonas
was cast forth by(490,10) at the Bas(588,15).”

In this Afric T(1549,9)(63,10)I leave you, reader, and if you be a
Nantucket(29,8)a whaleman, you will silently worship there.


CHAPTER 105. Does(682,10)’s Magnitude Diminish?—Will He Perish?

Inasmuch, then, as this(1492,11)comes floundering down upon us(398,8)e head-waters(1836,8)Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,
in the long course(1937,8)generations, he has not degenerated(1361,9)
original bulk(2003,8)sires.

But upon investigation we find, that not only are(1578,10)(215,8)
present day superior in m(369,9)to those whose fossil remains are
found i(1302,8)rtiary system (embracing a distinct geological period
prior to man), but(1772,8)whales (102,11)at(103,16), those
belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier
ones.

Of all the pre-adamit(322,9)yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
Alabama one mentione(302,9)last chap(823,9)that was less than
seventy feet in(1397,8)in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,
(1081,9)tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for(94,13) of a
large sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen’s authority,
that Sperm(2006,8)have been captured near(1415,11)feet long at the
time of(49,8).

But may it not be, that whil(762,19) (762,8)hour are an
advance(769,14)upon(551,10)all previous(711,18)s; may
(132,16)since Adam’s time they have(1016,12)?

Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of
such gentlemen as Pliny(608,8)e ancient naturalist(1175,8)lly. For
Pliny tells us of(1080,8)that embraced acres of living bulk, and
Aldrovandus of others which measured eight(485,14)(736,9)—Rope
Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even(1155,8)days of Banks and
Solander, Cooke’s(251,12),(1330,8) a Danish member(1836,8)Academy
of Sciences sett(1600,9)certain Iceland(727,8)(reydan-siskur, or
Wrinkled Bellies) at one(745,9)and twenty yards; that is, three
(41,12)sixty feet. And Lacépède, the French(485,11), in his
elaborate history(480,10),(1480,8)very beginning(1725,8)work (page
3), sets down the Right Whale(215,16)metre(196,8)(237,12)
twenty-eight(203,11)t(110,9)was published so late as A.D. 1825.

But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. T(1802,8) of to-day is
as big as his ancestors in Pliny’s time. And if ever I go where Pliny
is, I, a(138,10)(more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.
Because I cannot understand how i(534,8)(1252,13)Egyptian mummies
that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not
(1583,8)so muc(1661,8)ir coffins as a(1556,8)Kentuckian in his socks;
and(1424,11)cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest
(222,9)and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they
are drawn, just as plainly prove (1836,9)high-bred, stall-fed, prize
cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed(1627,14)the
fattest of Pharaoh’s fat kine;(2022,8)fac(1663,9)this, I will not
admit that(1698,8)(330,8)(1783,9) alone should(1657,17).

But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated(371,8)more
recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient
look-outs at the mast-head(1971,9)whale-ships, now penetrating even
through Behring’s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and
locker(117,10)orld;(1852,9)(831,8) harpoons and lances darted along
all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long
endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc;(79,9)he must not
at last be exterminated from the waters,(233,9)last whale, like the
last man, smoke his last pipe(60,9)n himself evaporate(712,9)inal
puff.

Comparing the humped herds(1681,10) with(32,21)buffalo,
which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of(1284,11)the
prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and
scowled(172,9)ir thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous
river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar
an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem
furnished, to show(1295,11)unted whale(1688,8)now escape speedy
extinction.

But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a
period ago—not a good lifetime—the censu(1065,9)buffalo in(465,9)
exceeded (47,14)men now in London(770,8)ough(1163,8)present day
not one horn or hoof of them(1324,8) in all that region(1090,8)ough the
cause of this wondrous(925,11)ion was the spear of man; yet the far
different nature(1324,14)hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious
an end(1437,8)(1159,9). Forty men in one ship hunt(951,8)Sperm Whales
for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well(1145,8)ank
God, if (1204,8)they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the
day(1595,9)old Canadian and Indian hunters and trapp(1530,11)West,
whe(1923,8)r west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness
and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for(39,19)
months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, w(2037,10)slain
(1323,9), bu(1334,8)(1754,9)and mor(839,9)es; a fact that, if need
were, could be statistically stated.

Nor, considered aright, does it seem any(1165,10)in favour of the
gradual (1113,10)(1950,8)(638,11), for example, that in former
years (the latter part(2021,8)last century, say) thes(779,11)s, in
small pods, were encountered much oftener than at(1083,8), and, in
consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more
remunerative. Because, as has been else(1607,8)ticed, those whales,
influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense
caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,
and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but
widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally
fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-call(1802,8)-bone
whales no longer haunt many grounds(656,10) years abounding with
them, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being
driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast i(180,12)enlivened
with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand(644,9)
very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.

Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned(931,13)(1635,10)two
firm fortresses, which,(1950,8)human probability, will for ever remain
impregnable. And as upon the invas(1169,10)ir valleys, the frosty
Swiss have retreate(1902,8)ir mountains; so, hunted from the savannas
and glade(1751,9)middle seas,(2039,11)bon(997,8) can(1865,9)resort
(121,9)Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers
and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed
circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.

But as perhaps fifty of the(1265,8)(279,13)are harpooned for one
cachalot, some philosopher(371,9)forecastle have concluded that this
positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.
But though for some time past a numbe(1829,8)(1495,10) not less than
13,000, have been annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the
Americans alone; yet there are(2009,9)ations which render even this
circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this
matter.

Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous(1086,15) populousness
(837,8)ore enormous creatur(868,10)globe, yet what shall we say to
Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the
King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions(33,10) are
numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems
no reason to doubt that i(848,8)(150,9), which have now been hunted
for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all
the successive monarch(1285,9)East—if they still survive there in
great numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all(420,8), since
he has a pasture to expatiate in(272,8)is precisely twice as large as
all Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the
Isl(1546,10)sea combined.

Moreover: we are to(939,9), that(1632,10)presumed great longevity of
(1107,8)their probably attai(853,9)age of a century and more,
therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult gen(1112,8)
must be contemporary. And wha(670,8)s, we may soon gain some idea of,
by imagining(328,8) grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of
creation yielding up the live bodies of(94,9)men, women, and
children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this
countless host to(452,9)ent human population(1221,13).

W(400,8), for(587,8)se things, we(1424,9)the whale immortal in his
species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam(683,8)s
before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the
Tuil(428,11)Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah’s flood he
despised(25,8)Ark; and if e(116,8)world(1641,10)again flooded, like
the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will
(1211,13), and rearing upon the topmost crest(1698,8)equatorial
flood, spout his frothed defiance(561,8)skies.


CHAPTER 106. Ahab’s Leg.

The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to
his own person. He had light(59,9)uch energy upon a thwart of his
bo(1068,8)his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock(1135,8)en
after gaining (155,8)deck, and(18,9)pivot-hole there, he so
vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command(436,9)teersman (it
was, as ever, something ab(508,8)not steering inflexibly enough);
then, the already shaken ivory(275,10)such an additional twist and
wrench, that though it still remained entir(916,8)o all appearances
lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.

And, indeed, it seemed small matter for won(1785,11)or all his
pervading, mad recklessness,(138,10)at times give careful hee(411,8)
condi(1393,10)at dead bone upo(817,8)he partly stood. For it(786,8)
been very long prior(1507,8)Pequod’s sailing from Nantucket, that he
had been found one night lying pr(149,9)the ground, and insensible;
by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his
ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that(274,8)stake-wise
smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme
difficulty(683,8)e agonizing wound was(619,10)cured.

Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac min(209,8)all
the anguish(549,9)then(1980,9)suffering was but the direct issue of
a former woe; and he too plainly(772,8)to see(128,8)s the most
poisonous reptil(1870,8) marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as
the sweetest songster(1680,8)grove; so, equally with every felicity,
all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than
equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief
go further than(52,31)Joy. For, not to hint of
this:(706,9)is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that
while some(262,8) enjoyments here shall have no children born to them
for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the
joy-child(1297,8) of all hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal
miseries shall still fertile(480,10)o themselves an eternally
progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all(409,16), there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the
thing. For(621,14), while even the highest earthl(752,9)ies
ever have a(522,9)unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at
bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an
archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the
obvious deduction. To trail the genealogie(324,8)se high(540,16), carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitur(86,9)
gods; so that,(455,8)face(690,8)the glad, hay-making suns, and soft
cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to (1015,10)
the gods(720,13)re not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad
birth-mark(655,8)brow of man, i(1560,10)stamp of sorrow in the
signers.

Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
properly, in set way, have(67,8)sclosed before. With many other
particulars concerning Ahab, always(1873,8)remained a mystery to some,
why it was, that for(839,11)period, both before and after the
sailing(1774,8)Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such
Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought
speechless refuge, as it were,(751,11)marble senat(1947,9)dead.
Captain Peleg’s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means
adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab’s(1294,8)part, every
revelation partook more of(1149,11)t darkness than of explanatory
light. Bu(945,10)end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.
That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness. And
not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore,
who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned approach
to him;(129,9)timid(108,8)the above hinted casualty—remaining, as it
did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested itself with terrors, not
entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that,
through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as(1795,8)
lay, to muffle up the knowledge of(767,12)from others; and hence it
(1091,10)not till a considerabl(958,10) had elapsed, did it
transpire upon(1100,11)’s decks.

But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod(1727,8)air,
or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not
with earthly Ahab, ye(1831,8)is present(864,8)of his leg, he took
plain practical procedures;—he called the carpenter.

And when that functionary(1178,11)efore him, he bade him without
delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him
supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which
had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful
selection(1670,8)stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured.
This done,(371,14) received orders to have the leg completed that
night; and to provid(691,8)e fittings for it, independent of those
pertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship’s forge was
ordered to be hoisted out of it(1467,12)idlenes(1047,8) hold; and,
to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commande(254,8)ceed at
once(205,8)forging of whatever iron contrivances(419,10)needed.


CHAPTER 107. The C(793,11)Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
abstracted man alone(1254,8) seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But
(1481,9)same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both con(1927,10)and hereditary.
But most humble though he wa(131,8)ar from furnishing an example of
the high, humane (301,8)ion;(1455,14)(828,10)was no(175,10);
hence, he now comes in person on this stage.

Like all sea-going ship(1297,10)s, and more especially those belonging
to whaling vessels,(255,9)to a certain off-handed,(1434,11)extent,
alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his
own;(1493,14)’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk
of all those(130,10)handicrafts which more or less(1734,12)with
wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him(537,8)generic remark above, thi(525,12)of(2006,11) was singularly
efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually
recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years’(1634,11)
uncivilized(795,8)-distant seas. For not to speak(2014,8)readiness in
ordinary duties:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the
shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s eye(1471,9)deck, or new
tree-nail(1502,9)side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more
directly (1692,14)his special business; he was moreover
unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitud(1249,8)
useful and capricious.

The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table(1320,8)ed with several
vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times
except when whales were alongsid(860,8)bench was securely lashed
athwartships against the rea(906,9)Try-works.

A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:
(1241,13) claps it into one(810,8)ever-ready vices, and
straightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage
strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of
right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory,(1492,14)
makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the
(331,11)oncocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars
to be painted upon the blad(404,13)y oar; screwing each oar in his
big vice(696,8)(246,15) symmetrically supplies the
constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings(275,16)drills his ears. Another has the toothache:(167,15)out
pincers, and clapping one hand upon (868,10)bids him be seated there;
but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded
operation; whirling round the handl(821,9)wooden vice(622,16)signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw(299,10).

Thus(1977,17)was prepared at all points, and alike in(1267,9)
and without respec(1519,8). Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he
deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But
while now upon so wide a field thu(1564,9)ly accomplished (202,8)
such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue
some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For
nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal
stolidity as it were;(33,11), I say; for it so shaded off into the
surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the gener(139,13)discernible in the whole visible world; which while
pauselessly active in un(603,8)modes, still eternally holds its peace,
and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was
this half-horrible (360,10)(546,8)involving, too, as it appeared, an
all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an
old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked
now and then with(593,11)grizzled wittiness; such as might have
served to pass the time during the midnight watch (1696,8)earded
forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old(1680,11)had been a
life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had
gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small
outward clinging(293,12) originally pertained to him? He was a
stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born
babe; living(1449,9)premeditated reference to(1229,8)rld or the next.
You might almost say,(397,11)strange(139,14)(1328,11)
involved a sort of un(1288,12); for in his numerous trades, he did
not(1381,9)work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he
(558,9)tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or
uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
process.(503,9) pure manipulator; his brain(2010,8)had ever had one,
must have early oozed along(1474,9) muscles of his finger(123,9)
like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, _multum in
parvo_, Sheffield contrivances, assum(1031,8)exterior—though a little
swelled—of a common pocket knife; but containing(956,11)blades of
various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,
pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted
to use the(1198,11)for a(142,13),(610,8)y had to do was to open
that part of him,(1452,8) screw was fast: or if for(211,11)take him
up by the legs(69,9)re they were.

Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut(1426,10),
was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a
common soul(1882,9)he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously
did its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few
drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But(25,8)t was;(361,11)it
had abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same
unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him;(69,16)at kept
him a gre(609,11)(1978,9)soliloquizing; but only like an
(1061,12)wheel, which also hummingly(72,11)es; or rather, his
body was a sentry-box a(248,8)(60,11)r on guard there, and talking
all(186,10)to keep himself awake.


CHAPTER 108. Ahab(842,9)C(929,8).

The Deck—First Night Watch.

(_(43,9) standing before his vice-bench, and(883,9)ight of two
lanterns busily fil(1309,8)ivory joist for(943,8)(347,8)joist is
firmly fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws,
and (1331,8)tools(1778,8)sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red
flame(574,8)forge is seen, w(1124,8) blacksmith is at work._)

Drat the file, and d(19,8)bone! That is hard which should be soft,
and that is soft(39,17)hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
shinbones. Let’s try another. Aye, now, this works better (_sneezes_).
Halloa, this bone dust is(39,12)—why it’(21,14)yes it’s
(42,12)bless my soul, it won’t let me speak! This is what an old
fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you
don’t get this dust; amputate(51,8)bon(51,10) (51,10)it(203,12). Come, come, you old Smut,(987,8)bear a hand, and let’s
have that ferule and buckle-screw; I’ll be ready(835,8)m presently.
Lucky now(432,12) there’s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle
a little; but a mere (572,8)(472,10)easy as making hop-poles; only I
should like to put a good finish on. Time, time; if I(1422,10)had the
time, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ev(689,14)
scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs
I’ve seen in shop windows wouldn’t compare at all. They soak water,
they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored(820,12) with washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before
I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the
length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess. Ha! that’s
the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it’s somebody else,(71,8)certain.

AHAB (_advancing_). (_Dur(1672,8)ensuing scene, the c(1784,9)continues
sneezing at times._)

Well, manmaker!

Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length.
Let me measure, sir.

Measured for a leg! good. Well, it’s no(1632,8)rst time. About it!
There; keep thy finger on it.(1364,9)a cogent vice thou hast here,
(287,9);(1427,8)feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.

Oh, sir, it will break bones—beware, beware!

No fear; I like(1078,8)grip(20,9)to feel something in this slippery
world that can hold, man. What’s Prometheus about there?—the
(2002,10), I mean—what’s he about?

He must be forg(611,8)(1464,12), sir, now.

Right. It’s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a
fierce red flame there!

Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.

Um-m. So(66,8). I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old
Greek,(350,11), who made men, they say, should have been a(377,13)and animated them with fire; for what’s made in fire must
properly belong to fire; and so hell’s probable. How the soot flies!
This(481,9)the remainder the Greek made the Africans of. C(1107,8),
when he’s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel
shoulder-blades;(2007,9)a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.

Sir?

Hold; while(766,12)i(769,8)it, I’ll order a complete man after a
desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest
modelled after the Thames Tunnel(46,8)legs with roots to ’em, to stay
in one place(98,8)arms three feet(379,9)the wrist; no heart at all,
brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre(829,9)brains; and let
me see—shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on
top of his head to illuminate inward(2010,8), take the order, and away.

Now,(808,8)he speaking about, and who(29,15)to, I(926,8)like
to know? Shall I keep standing here? (_aside_).

’Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here’s one. No,
no, no; I(1237,11)a lantern.

Ho, ho! That’s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.

What art thou thrusting(1240,8)ief-catcher into my face for, man?
Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.

I thought, sir, that you spoke to (1911,9).

(1103,9)? why that’s—but no;—a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely
gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here,(133,10);—or would’st
thou rather work in clay?

Sir?—Clay? clay, sir?(414,8)mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.

The fellow’s impious! (421,14)sneez(712,9)?

Bone is(150,8)dusty(81,9)(799,8)hint, then; and when(246,10)dead, never bury thyself under
living people’s noses.

Sir?—oh! ah!—I guess so;—yes—oh, dear!

Look y(341,12), I dare say thou callest(122,9)a right good
work(444,8)workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for
thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall
nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that
is(268,13)my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Can(653,8)not drive that old Adam away?

Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard
something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
entirely loses the feeling(1517,8)old spar, but it will be still
pricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?

It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here(455,8)place where mine once
was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the
soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly(15,8)there to
a hair, do I. Is’t a riddle?

(1736,9)humbly call it a poser(1141,8)Hist, then. How dost thou kn(469,8)some entire, living, thinking thing
may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly(1857,10)precisely where(725,8)w standest; aye, and(1910,10)t(426,10)y spite? In thy most
solitary hours(1058,8)(218,10)not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don’t
speak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be
now so long dissolved;(1202,8)hy mayst not thou(1315,13)(107,8)
fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!

Good Lord! (1031,12)if it comes to that, I must calculate over
again; I think I didn’t carry a small figure(1733,8)(1518,9)pudding-heads(652,8)never grant premises.—How long before the
leg is done?

Perhaps an hou(701,9)Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (_turns to go_). Oh, Life!
Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet(692,10)debtor to this
blockhead for a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal
inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers. I would be free
as air; and I’m down(1678,8)whole world’s books. I am so rich, I could
have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Prætorians at the auction of
the Roman empire (which was th(141,9));(345,9)I owe for(1786,10)
in the tongue I brag with. By heavens! I’ll get a crucible, and into
it, and(891,9) myself down to one small, compendious vertebra. So.

CARPENTER (_resuming his work_).

Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says
he’s queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;(68,11), says Stubb; (92,10)—queer,(105,8)and keeps dinning it
into Mr. Starbuck all the time—queer—si(76,14), very queer. And
here’s his leg! Yes, (1620,9)(1109,8)of it, (45,11)bedfellow! has
a stick of whale’s jaw-bone for a wife! And this i(116,9); he’ll
(906,8) this. What was that now about one leg(1693,10)in three
places, and all three places(47,13)one hell—how(99,9)? Oh! I
don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of
strange-thoughted sometimes, they say;(552,9)’s only haphazard-like.
Then, a short,(575,8)old body like me,(1451,14)undertake to wade
out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks
you under the chin pretty quick, and there’s a great cry for
life-boats. And(574,8)the heron’s leg! long and slim, sure enough!
Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime(151,8)at must be
because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her
roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he’s a hard driver. Look,
driven(712,9)to death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears
out bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a h(439,9)
with those screws, and let’s finish it(2036,11) resurrection fellow
comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as
brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill ’em up again.
What a leg(1124,8)! It looks like a real live leg, filed(1643,8)
(1485,14)e core; he’ll be(1139,10)on this to-morrow(37,10)
taking altitudes on it(404,8)! I almost forgot the(998,9)val slate,
smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So, so; chisel, file,
and sand-paper, now!


CHAPTER 109. Ahab and(1611,10)in the Cabin.

According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
inconsiderable oil came up with(1151,10); the casks below must have
sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown;(211,14)went down into
the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*

*In Sperm-whalemen with any (214,13)quantity of oil on board, it
is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and
drench(289,11)with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying
intervals, is removed(1085,8)ship’s pumps. Here(1110,8)asks are sought
to be kept damply tight; while(1165,9)hanged character of the
withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the
precious cargo.

Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and
the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from
the China(1921,8)(463,9)Pacific. And so(889,10)found Ahab with a
general chart(112,8)oriental archipelagoes spread(1453,8)him; and
another separate one represent(956,8)long eastern coasts(432,8)Japanese islands—Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. W(1533,8)snow-white new
ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long
pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with
his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his
old courses(1668,8)
“Who’s there?” hear(1310,8)footstep at the door, but not turning round
to it. “On deck! Begone!”

“Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil(1478,8)hold is leaking, sir.
We must up Burtons and break out.”

“U(29,23)? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here
for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?”

“Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make
good in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth
sav(302,9)”

“So it is, so it is; if we get it.”

“I was speaking(943,9)(397,14)(84,10)And I was not(55,11)r thin(67,10)at at all.(520,8) Let it
leak! I’m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky
casks, but those leaky(1530,11)in a leaky ship; and that’s a far
worse plight than(1394,11)’s, man. Yet I don’t stop to plug my leak;
for who can find it(714,8)deep-loaded hull; or how hope(74,9)it,
even if found, in this life’s howling gale?(1405,9)! I’ll not have the
(795,8)hoisted.”

“What will the owners say, sir?”

“Let(28,13)tand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What
cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me,(1617,9),
abo(468,9)miserly owners, as if(198,12)were my conscience. But
look ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye,
(91,13) is(409,9)ship’s keel.—(1268,8)(1260,16),” said the reddening mate, moving further(1898,10)cabin,
with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost
seemed(831,10)every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward
manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than half
distrustful(61,10); “A better man than I might well pass over in
thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in
a happier, (1675,12).”

“Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?—On
(510,9)Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir—to be forbearing!
Shall we not understand each other(324,8)than hitherto(222,14)?”

Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
South-Sea-men’s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards(976,11)exclaimed: “There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one
(851,8)(45,8)l(45,13)Pequod(901,13)For an instan(1421,9)flashing eyes(1770,8)mate, and his fiery cheeks,
you would have alm(548,8)ght that he had really received the blaze of
the levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and
as he quitted(1068,11) paused f(246,14)and said: “Thou hast
outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware
of(1668,9); th(295,8)st but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab;
(16,10)thyself, old man.”

“He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!”
murmured Ahab, a(660,10) disappeared. “What’s(464,9)said—Ahab(165,11)Ahab—there’s something there!” Then unconsciously using the
(879,8)or a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro(696,8)little
cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and
returning the gun to(1027,9), he went(21,8)deck.

“(1978,9)but too good a fellow(1979,11)”(319,8) lowly(93,8)mate;
then rais(753,8)voice(129,8)crew: “Furl the t’gallant-sails, and
close-reef the top(30,8)fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton,
and break ou(1053,9)main-hold.”

It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as(1950,8)ing
(1284,9) Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him;
or mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously
forbade(2027,15)symptom of open disaffection, however transient,
in the important chief officer(638,8)ship. However(290,9)his orders
were executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.


CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.

Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
(505,8)fectly sound, a(67,12)leak must be further off. So, it
being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturb(1080,8)slumber(1706,9)huge ground-tier butts;(1070,8)m that black midnight
sending those gigantic moles(249,10)daylight above. So deep did they
go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect(1892,8)lowermost
puncheon(816,8)you(1879,8)looked next for some mouldy corner-stone
cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copi(2028,10)posted
placards, vainly wa(1301,10)infatuated old worl(351,9)e flood.
Tierce after tierce, too, of water, (1126,8)d, and beef, and shooks of
staves, and iron bundles of hoops,(778,13) out, till at last the
piled deck(825,8)ard to get about(865,10)hollow hull echoed under
foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and
rolled(1717,8)sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the
ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was
it(1007,10)Typhoons did not visit them then.

Now, at this time(1082,8)that my poor pagan companion, and fast
bosom-friend,(1183,9), was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh
to his endless end.

Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be(849,8), the
higher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor(266,12)ho, as
harpooneer, must not only face all the rage(1084,9)iving whale, but—as
we have elsewhere seen—mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and
finally descend(1539,10)gloom(1394,9)ol(958,8)itterly sweating all
day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, amo(274,8)men,
the (346,10)s are(1743,9)ers, so called.

P(410,12)! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,
stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about
amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom
of a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow prov(193,8)m, poor
pagan(229,8) strange to say, for(746,9)heat of his(603,9)s, he
caught a terrible chill which lapsed into(1111,8); and(1561,8), after
some days’ suffering, laid him(1343,9)ammock, clos(639,8) very sill
of the door of death. How he wasted and(11,9)w(792,8)ose few
long-lingering days, till t(958,8)med but little left of him but his
frame and tattooing. But as all else i(616,8)inned, and his
cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless,(149,8)growing fuller
and fuller; they became of a(491,9)softness of lustre; and mildly but
deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony
to that immortal health(263,8)which could not die, or be weakened. And
like circles on the wat(1710,9), as they grow fainter, expand; so his
eyes(462,8)rounding an(13,10), like the rings of Eternity. An awe
that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of
this waning savage, and saw as(917,10)hings(777,8)face, as any
beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly
(436,9)and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And
the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all
with a last revelation(68,8)only an author from the dead could
adequately tell. So that—let us say it again—no dying Chaldee or Greek
had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you
saw creeping(1672,10)face of p(1772,12), as he quietly lay in his
swaying(1288,10)and the rolling sea(1039,9)ently rocking him to his
final rest(65,10)ocean’s invisible flood-tide lifted him(267,11)
higher towards his destined heaven.

Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as f(2036,11) himself,
what he(374,8)(1672,8)case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
asked. He called one to(1632,8)the grey morning watch, when the day was
just breaking, and taking his hand, sa(2024,8)while in Nantucket he had
chanced to see certain(1624,8)canoes of dark wood(1171,13)ch
war-wood(1944,8)native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all
whalemen who died(174,13), were laid(1835,10)same dark canoes,
and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was
not un(1400,9)custom(494,8)own race, who, after embalming a dead
warrior, stretched him out(1339,8)cano(1379,8)o left(796,8)be floated
away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do(1891,8)lieve(266,9)
stars are isles, but that far beyond all (886,8)horizons, their own
mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens;(230,8)form
the white breakers(916,8)milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the
(902,11)being buried(1691,8)(1180,10)ccording(329,8)usual
sea-custom, tossed like something vile(381,8)death-devouring sharks.
No: he desired a canoe(1972,8)ose of(709,12)all the more congenial
to him, being a whaleman, that like(22,8)-boat these coffin-canoes
were without a keel; though that involved but un(1002,8)steer(1092,8)
much lee-way adown the dim ages.

Now(1167,9)is strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
was at once commanded to do(1667,9)’s bidding, whatever it might
include. There was some heathenish,(290,9)oloured old lumber aboard,
which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut(2022,10)aboriginal
grove(713,9)Lackaday islands, and(56,9)se dark planks th(457,8)
was recomme(270,8)be made. No sooner was(332,14) apprised of the
order, than(1556,12)rule, he forthwith with(661,9)indifferent
promptitude(1768,9)haracter, proceeded into the forecastle and took
(456,11)measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking(515,11)
person as he shifted the rule.

“Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejacula(64,8)Long Island
sailor.

Going to his vice-bench(703,15) for convenience sake and general
reference, now transferringly(271,8)d on it the exact length the
coffin was to be, and then made the(87,9) permanent by cutting two
notches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the(671,8)and his
tools, and to work.

When the last nail was driven(176,9) lid duly planed and fitted, he
lightly shouldered(789,11) and went forward with it, inquiring
whether they were ready(2005,8)yet in that direction.

Overhearing(769,9)gnant but half-humorous cries with which the people
on deck began to drive(197,13)way,(1240,9), to every one’s
consternation,(1296,12)hat the thing should be instantly brought to
him, no(1059,9)re any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will
shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the(956,12)s (205,8) be
indulged.

Leaning over(2019,17)(1584,8) long regard(581,14)with an
attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock
drawn from it(917,11)(45,8)iron part placed in(720,13)long
with one(1587,8)paddles(1388,8)boat. All by his own request, also,
biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh
water was(171,8)at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up
in the hol(67,9)foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for
a pillow(466,11)now entreat(1809,9)lift(1659,8)his final bed, that
he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without
moving a few minutes, then told one to go(1578,8)bag and bring out his
little god, Yojo. Then cross(1942,8)arms on his breast with Yojo
between, he(677,12)(1311,11)lid (hatch(36,11)it) to be placed
over him. The head part turned over with a leather hing(1652,10)re lay(2002,9)(899,8)(863,12)little but his composed countenance in
view. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and
sign(525,9)re(870,10)(1045,11).

But ere this wa(1770,8)Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all
this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took
him by the hand;(1044,8)other, hold(528,8)tambourine.

“Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where
go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where
the beaches are only beat with water-lilies,(173,9)do one little
errand for me? Seek out one(409,9)’s now been missing long: I think
he’s in those far(170,9). If ye find him, then(1015,8) him; for he
must be very sad; for look! he’s left(402,15) behind;—I found
it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! N(1222,12), die; and I’ll beat ye your(1903,8)arch.”

“I have heard,”(771,10)Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in
violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and
that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their
wholly forgotten childhood those(121,16)(919,10)really spoken
(81,8) hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor
Pip, in this strange sweetnes(1916,9)lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers
of all our(29,10)homes. Where learned he that, but there?—Hark! he
speaks again: but more wildly now.”

“Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’s his
harpoon? Lay it across here.—(697,21)huzza! Oh for a game
cock now to sit upon his head and crow!(1975,10)dies game!—mind ye
that;(34,21)take ye good heed of (47,19)
game! I say; game, game, game! but bas(1133,8) Pip, he died a coward;
died all a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; i(1100,10)Pip, tell all the
(1309,9)he’s a runaway;(106,9),(10,10)(126,9)! Tell them he
jumped from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my(1158,12)over base Pip,
and hail him(530,8), if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame
upon all cowards—shame upon them! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that(205,25). Shame! shame!”

During(1715,9)(1321,10) lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip
was led aw(1919,8)the sick man was replaced in his hammock.

But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
that his coffin was proved a good fit(222,11)suddenly rallied; soon
there seemed no n(771,9)e carpenter’s box:(232,8)reupon, when some
expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the
cause(1289,8)sudden convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he
had just recalled a(915,8)duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;
(232,9)fore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,
he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter
of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a
word, it was(1321,9)’s conceit, that if a man made up(238,10)to
live, mere sickness(245,11)kill him: nothing but(1111,8), or a gale,
or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer(1430,8) sort.

Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
that while a sick,(30,10) man may be six months(658,10)ing,
generally speaking, a sick(114,8)is almost half-well again in a day.
So, in good time my(1743,10)gained strength; and at length after
sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a
vigorous appetite) he(1079,10)leaped to his feet, threw out his arms
and legs, gave himself(1171,8)stretching, yawn(927,12)bit(1354,9)n
springing into the head(1055,8)hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,
pronounced(136,9)fit(276,8)ight.

With a wild whimsiness, he now used(1383,12)for a sea-chest; and
empty(172,9)it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
grotesque figures and drawings; and it(1516,8)that hereby he was
striving,(1715,8)rude way, to copy parts(1568,8)twisted tattooing on
his body. And this(32,11)had been the work of a departed prophet
and seer(1550,8)island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written
out on (146,8) a complete theory(1769,8)heavens(1992,9)earth, and a
mystical treatise(869,8)art of attaining truth; so that(1915,10)in
(1475,8)proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one
volume; but whose mysteries not even(882,9)could read, though(1608,8)
live heart beat against them;(2021,8)(94,13)were(1810,10)
destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon
they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last(597,12)hought
it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his,
when one morning turning away from surveying poor(1864,9)—“Oh,
devilish tantaliz(95,9)the gods!”


CHAPTER 111. The Pacific.

When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great
South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear
Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplic(336,9)my
youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a
thousand leagues of blue.

There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
fabled undulation(1311,9)Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.
John. And meet it is, that(58,9)se sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery
prairies and Potters’ Fields of all four continents, the waves should
rise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of
mixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all
that we call liv(77,8)ouls, lie dreaming,(10,10) still; tossing
like slumberers in their beds; the ever(332,11)ves but made so by
their restlessness.

To any meditative Magian rover,(634,8)ren(1001,9), once beheld, must
ever after be the sea(1788,8)adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of
the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same
waves wash the mole(2033,9)new-built Californian towns, but yesterday
planted(1224,8)recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still
gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between
float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown
Archipelago(47,8)impenetrable Japans. Thus this(1944,8)ous, divine(1365,9)zones (428,9)’s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to
it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lif(387,9)ose eternal
swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.

But few(1931,8)s of Pan stirred Ahab’s brain, as standing like an iron
statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one
nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from(1887,17)
(in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other
consciously inhal(129,8)alt breath(848,11) found sea(1825,9)a in
which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at
length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese
cruising-ground, the old man’s purpose intensified itself. His firm
lips met(1851,8)e lips of a vice; the Delt(1273,9)forehead’s veins
swelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran
through the vaulted hull, “Stern all! the(372,13)spouts thick
blood!”


CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.

Availing himself(1352,8)mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
these latitud(1153,9)n preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits
shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old
b(216,9), had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after
concluding his contributory work for(1081,8)leg,(1552,10) retained it
on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts(1657,8)foremast; being now almost
incessantly invok(1711,10)heads(1698,9)harpoone(814,9)bowsmen to do
some little job(396,8)m; altering, or repai(14,9)new shaping their
various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an
eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades,
pike-heads,(246,8)(1824,8)anc(1836,8)jealously watch(460,8)every
sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this(1097,11)was a
patient hammer wiel(222,8) (28,8)arm. No murmur, no impatience, no
petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn;(1773,8)over
still further his chronically broken back,(226,10) away, as if toil
were life itself, and(613,8)vy (1981,8)of his(246,8)(32,17)
(32,8)eart. And so it was.—Most miserable!

A(1034,9) walk in(365,13), a certain slight but painful appearing
yawing(1371,8)gait, had at an early period(1748,8)voyage excited the
curiosity(1280,9)ariners. And(1068,8)importun(40,10)ir persisted
questionings he had finally given in; a(280,9)came to pass that every
one now knew the shameful story(1661,8)wretched fate.

Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter’s midnight, on the road
running between two country towns, the (1390,10) half-stupidly felt
the deadly numbness steal(699,8) him(728,8)ught refuge in a leaning,
dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss(1719,8)extremities of both
feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four
act(102,9)gladness(809,10)one long, and as yet uncatastrophied
fifth act(72,9)rief(855,8)life’s drama.

He was an(785,10)who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
encountered that thing in sorrow’s technicals called ruin. He had been
an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house
and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife(1168,8)ree
blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,
planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of dark(501,10)further
conceal(74,8)most cunning disguis(1638,8) desperate burglar slid into
his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to
tell(926,18)imself did ignorantly conduct this(144,9)(139,9)family’(1485,9)It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of
that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now,
for prudent, most wise, and economic reaso(1176,18)’s shop was
in the basement(1739,8)dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so
that always had the young and(692,8)healthy wife listened with no
unhappy nervousness(127,11)vigorous pleasure,(1661,8)stout ring(1900,8)er young-armed old husband’(1958,8); whose reverberations, muffled
by passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,
in her nursery(1765,8), to stout Labor’s iron lullaby(433,18)
infants were rocked to slumber.

Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
Had(36,8)taken this old(1748,12)to thyself ere his full ruin came
upon him, then(526,15)widow had a delicious grief, and her
orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after
years; and(1060,8)them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked
down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely
hung the responsibil(1931,9)some other family, and left the worse than
useless(1785,8) standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him
easier to harvest.

Why tell the whole? The blow(2015,9)(1062,9)hammer every day grew
more and more between; and each blow(52,15) fainter than the
last; the wife sat frozen(2017,8)window, with tearless eyes,
glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her(1833,11)the bellows
fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother
dived down(134,10)lo(1901,9)-yard grass;(141,13) twice followed
her thither; and(120,10)less, family(539,16)ggered off a
vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to
flaxen curls!

Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; b(881,8)
is only a launch(441,13)region(645,8)strange Untried; it is but
the first salutation(1574,8)pos(888,14)the immense Remote, the
Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefo(1665,11)death-longing eyes of
such men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions
against suicide, does the all-contributed(1252,8)-receptive ocean
alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking
terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of
infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them—“Come hither,
broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate
death; here are wonders supernatural,(72,9)dying for them. Come
hither! bury(1800,9)in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and
abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. (277,11)! put
up _thy_ gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and c(347,11) till
we marry thee!”

Hearken(402,10)se voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by
fall of eve, the blacksmith’s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth
went a-whaling.


CHAPTER 113. The Forge.

With matted be(241,9)swathed in a br(1960,8)shark-skin apron, about
mid-day, Perth was(1897,9)(1749,8) his forge and anvil, the latter
placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the
coal(895,8)ith the other at(132,10)’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came
along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While
yet a little distance(1011,10)forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last,
Perth, withdrawing his iron(77,11)ire, began hammering it upon the
anvil—the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,
some of which flew close to Ahab.

“Are these thy Mother Carey’s chickens, Perth? they are always flying
in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look here, they
burn; but thou—thou liv’st among them(1289,9)a scorch.”

“Because I am scorched all over,(565,13),” answered Perth, resting
for a moment o(583,8)mmer; “I am past scorching; not easily can’st
thou scorch a scar.”

“Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful
to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others
that is not mad. Thou should’st go mad,(1235,11); say, why dost thou
no(43,8)? How can’st thou endur(1718,10)being mad? Do(1859,8)vens
yet hate thee, that thou(78,8)(101,11)—What wert thou making
there?”

“Welding an old(1136,10), sir; there were seams and dents in it.”

“And(201,13)make it all smooth again(286,12), after such hard
usage as it had?”

“I think so, sir(110,9)I suppose(248,13)smoothe almost any(181,16); never
mind how hard the metal(447,12)?”

“Aye, sir, (138,8)I can; all(273,17)but one.”

“Look ye(939,10)n,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning
with both hands on Perth’s shoulders; “l(108,11)—_here_—can ye
(274,8)out a seam like this(398,13)” sweeping(1670,10)across his
ribbed brow; “if thou could’st(472,14)glad enough would I lay my
head(1456,8)y(1828,8)and feel thy heaviest hammer(1886,9)my eyes.
Answer! C(825,11)(504,8)this seam?”

“Oh! (950,8)the one, sir! Said I not(456,28)(513,10)(694,12)i(80,12); aye, man(25,8)unsmoothable; for
though thou only see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into
the bone of my skull—_that_ is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s
play(1352,9) gaffs and pikes to-day. (697,12)!” jingling the
leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. “I, too, want a harpoon
made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth;
something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There’s the
stuff,” flinging the pouch(677,8)e anvil. (977,8)(1219,14)these
are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.”

“Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why(1931,15) thou hast(1118,12) the
best and stubbornest stuff we(1691,11)s ever work.”

“I know it, old man; thes(140,8) will weld together like glue from the
melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the(527,8). And(26,9)
first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer
these(66,8)(177,14)the yarns and strands of a tow-line(173,8)
I’ll blow the fire.”

When at last th(104,9)rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
spiral(860,8)m, with(689,9)hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A
flaw!” reject(707,8)last one. “Work that over(1927,8)Perth.”

This done, Perth was about to begin weld(797,8)twelve into one, when
Ahab stayed his ha(412,8)said he would weld(915,9)iron. As, then,
with regular, gasping hems, he hammered (920,12)(182,8)passing to
him the glowing rods, one after the other, and(648,8)d pressed forge
shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and
bowing over his head towards(598,9), seemed invoking some curse or
some blessing(256,8)toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.

“What’s that bunch of lucifers dodging(506,8)here for?” muttered
Stubb, looking on(1015,9) forecastle. “That(275,8)smells fire like a
fusee; and(30,8)of it himself, like a hot musket’s powder-pan.”

A(892,11)shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as
Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab’s bent face.

“Would’st thou brand m(905,8)?” wincing for a moment with the pain;
“have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?”

“Pray God, not that; yet I fear (1889,9)(1659,14). Is not this
harpoon for the White Whale?”

“For the white fiend! But now(53,9)barbs; thou must make them
thyself, man. Here are my razors—the best of steel; here, and(72,9)
barbs sharp as the needle-sleet(1953,8)Icy Sea.”

F(369,11), the old(2040,11) eyed the razors as though(1259,9)
fain not use them.

“T(220,8), man, I have no need(329,8)m; for I now neither shave, sup,
nor pray till—but here—to work!”

Fashioned(1705,9)into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the
shank, the steel soon pointed the end(317,8)iron(856,8) the
(301,11)(1618,10)giv(1698,8)barbs their(923,11), prior to
temper(1821,10)he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.

“No, no—no water for that; I want i(507,9)true death-temper. Ahoy,
there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me
as much blood as will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster
of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen
flesh(1786,10)(947,11)’s barbs were then tempered.

“Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed(22,11)diaboli!”
deliriously howled Ahab,(912,8)malignant iron scorchingly devoured the
baptismal blood.

Now, must(556,9) spare poles from below, and selecting one of
hickory,(1368,10)bark still investing it, Ahab fit(767,12)(812,8)ock(1098,10)iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some
fathom(1809,8)taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.
Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed(1905,9)arp-string,
then eagerly bending over it(330,8)eing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed,
“Good! and(1525,13)seizings.”

At one extremity(160,10)was unstranded(693,10)separate spread yarns
were all braided and woven rou(59,8)(425,13)harpoon; the pole
(414,9)driven hard(1988,9)(65,10); from the lower end(344,9)
was traced half-way along(104,9)’s length, and firmly secured so,
with intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope—like the
Three Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with
the weap(298,8)sound of his ivory leg(416,11)(32,8)the hickory
pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his
cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was
heard. Oh, Pip! thy w(849,8)laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy
strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended(1116,11)lack tragedy of the
melancholy ship, and mocked it!


CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.

Penetrating further and(12,9)(696,9)hear(1776,9)Japanese cruising
ground, the Pequod was soon all astir(1612,8)fishery. Often, in mild,
pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on
the(1249,8), they were engaged(1744,8)boats, steadily pulling, or
sai(12,8) paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or
seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small
success(1275,8)ir pains.

At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
sociably mixing(1802,10)soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone
cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy
quietude, when behold(2006,8)tranquil beauty and brillianc(844,9)ocean’s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and
would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a
remorseless fang.

T(251,18), when(428,8)whale-boat the rover softly feels a
certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
regards it as so much flowery earth;(1901,9)distant ship revealing
only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high
rolling waves, bu(32,10)the tall grass of a (47,8)prairie: as when
the western emigrants’ horses only show their erected ears, while their
hidden bodies widely wade(151,13)amazing verdure.

The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these
there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied
children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time,(334,10)flowers(1991,8)woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most
mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,
and form one seamless whole.

Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
(31,9) an effect on Ahab. But if(323,8)ecret golden keys did seem
to op(978,8)m his own(51,15)treasuries, yet did his breath
upon them prove but tarnishing.

Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes(1979,8)soul; in
ye,—though long parched by the dead drought(515,8)earthy life,—in ye,
men yet may roll, like young(894,8)in new morning clover; and for some
few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew(654,8)life immortal on them.
Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling
threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a
storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this
life; we do not advanc(1168,10)fixed gradations, and at the last one
pause:—(1404,8)infancy’s unconscious spell, boyhood’s thoughtless
faith, adolescence’ doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then
disbelief, resting at last in manhood’s pondering repose of If. But
once gon(1425,9), we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and
men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor
no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will
never weary? W(546,8)the foundling’s father hidden? Our souls are like
those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: th(1243,9)of
our paternity li(1089,9)ir grave, and we must there to learn it.

And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into that
same(1389,8)sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—

“Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s
eye!—Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping
cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep
down and do believe.”

And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in(392,10)
golden light:—

“I am(86,8)a(97,8) has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that
he has always been jolly!”


CHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.

And jolly enough were the sights and(1739,8)nds that came(721,9)down
before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had been welded.

It was a Nantucket ship, t(182,11), which had just wedged in her
last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in
glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,
sailing(1316,8)mong the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous
to pointing her prow for home.

The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red
bun(1565,8)their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,
bottom down; and hanging captive(77,10)bowsprit was seen the long
lower jaw of(1871,10)whale they had slain. Signals, ensig(1927,8)jacks
of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways
lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm;
above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of
the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen
lamp.

As was afterwards learned(865,14) had met with the most
surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in(207,10)seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without
securing a single fish. Not only had(400,12)beef and bread been
given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional
supplemental casks(1241,10)bartered for,(850,11)hips she(362,8);
and these were stowed al(1077,8)deck, and in the captain’s and
officers’ state-rooms. Eve(46,8)bin table itself(1406,10)knocked
into kindling-wood;(1534,9)cabin mess dined off the broad head of an
oil-butt, lash(1395,8)to the floor for a centrepiece. In the
forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,
and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a
head on his largest boiler, (98,11)it;(71,10)steward had plugged
his spare coffee-pot(65,25)harpooneers had headed the
sockets of their irons(139,12)them; that indeed everything was
filled with(718,8)except(595,15)pantaloons pockets, and those
he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of
his(990,8)satisfaction.

As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
barbarian sound of enormous drums came(1553,10)(634,10); and drawing
still nearer, a crowd(1551,8)men were seen stand(2033,10)her huge
try-pots,(1546,8)cover(391,8)the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin
of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to(1749,8)troke of the
clenched hand(584,8) crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and
(667,12)were dancing(1575,10)olive-hued girls who had eloped with
them(1291,10)Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,
firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long
Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were
presiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, other(374,9)ship’s
company were tumultuously busy at the masonry(434,8)try-works, from
which the huge pot(1667,11)removed. You would have almost thought
they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they
raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the
sea.

Lord and master over all this scene,(1798,12) stood erect on the
ship’s elevated(731,15)so(1532,10)whole rejoicing drama was
full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
diversion.

And Ahab, he too was(1080,10)on his(169,16)haggy and black,
with a stubborn gloom; and(381,8)two ships crossed each other’s
wakes—one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings
as to(47,8)to come—their two(1614,8)s in themselves impersonated the
whole striking contrast(809,9)cene.

“Come aboard, c(13,10)!” cried the gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting
a glass and a bottle in the air.

“Hast s(1096,8)White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.

“No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the
other good-humoredly. (248,12)!”

“Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”

“Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but(363,12), old
hearty(388,8)long. I’ll soon take that(1705,8)rom your brow. Come
along, will ye (merry’s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”

“How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, (328,9)
(106,24) bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an
empty ship, and out(172,11) So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward
there! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!”

And thus, while the one ship went cheerily(1223,8)the breeze(988,11)
(1101,8)ly fought against it; and so(1115,9)vessels parted; the crew
of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the
receding(963,9); but the(981,12)men never heeding their gaze for
the lively revelry (1759,10)in. And as Ahab, lean(1987,12)
taffrail, eyed the(637,15) craft(1476,8)k from his pocket a
small vial of sand, and then(280,9)from the ship(473,8)vial, seemed
thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was
filled with Nantucket soundings.


CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.

Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s favourites
sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewha(1552,8)
rushing(708,9)and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So(348,8)it with(689,11). For next day after encountering(1634,17),
whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.

It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings(271,8)crimson fight were done: and floating(1760,8)lovely sunset sea and sky,
sun and whale both stilly died(609,9); then, such a sweetness and
such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy
air, that it almost seemed as if far over(831,10)deep green convent
valley(293,8) Manilla isles, the Spanish land-(1296,8)wantonly turned
sailor, had gone to sea, freight(855,8)these vesper hymns.

Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned
off(1066,10)whale, sat intently watching his final wanings(1122,9)
now tranquil boat. F(1065,8)strange spectacle observable in all sperm(749,8)dying—the turning sunward(368,9)head,(1590,8)expiring—that
(110,17), beheld of(598,8)placid evening, somehow to Ahab
conveyed a(2047,9)ness unknown before.

“He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too
worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal(704,8)sun!—Oh
that these too-favouring eyes should see(36,21)sights.
Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in
these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks
furnish tablet(46,9)for long Chinese ag(949,8)billows have still
rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the
Niger’(575,10)source; here, too, life dies(747,10)full of faith;
but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it
heads some other way.

“Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
thy separate throne somewhere(1571,8)hear(1900,8)se unverdured seas;
thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to m(101,8)
wide-slaughtering Typhoo(63,8)he hushed burial of its after calm. Nor
has this thy whale(1163,10)turned his dying(1173,11)then gone round
again, without a lesson to me(385,9)rebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring,
rainbowed jet!—that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In
vain, oh(1537,8)dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening
sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet(113,10),
darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy
unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of
once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.

“Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
fowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though
hill and valley mothered me, y(1261,10)are my foster-brothers!”


CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.

The four whales slain that(1884,8) had died wide apart; one, far to
windward; one, less distant, to lee(31,9) ahea(11,8)stern. These
last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the (127,8) one
could not be reached till morning;(1087,9)boat that had killed it lay
by its side all night(59,8)at boat was Ahab’s.

The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s spout-hole; and
the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon
the black, glossy back, and far out(1758,9) midnight waves, which
gently chafed the(181,9)broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.

Ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep(464,9)Parsee; who
crouching(1660,8)bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played
(1870,10)whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A
sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven
ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.

Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw(328,13)and
hooped roun(1129,9)gloom of the night they(406,8)the last men in a
flooded world. “I have dreamed it again,” said he.

“Of the hearses? Have I not said, old ma(1656,8)neither hearse nor
coffin can be thine?”

“And who ar(95,8)d that die on(1357,8)?”

“But I(113,21)ere thou coulds(62,11)is voyage, two
hearses must verily be seen by the(118,12); the first not made by
mortal hands(1163,10)visible wood(402,8)last one must be grown in
America.”

“Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a(338,8)and its plumes
floating over the ocean(768,9) waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a
sight we shall not soon see.”

“Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it(344,8)(541,9).(496,10)at was that saying about thyself?”

“Though it come to(718,9), I shall still go before thee thy pilot(114,11)en thou art so gone before—if(1835,9)r befall—then ere I can
follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?—Was it not so?
Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two
pledges that(263,9)yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.”

“Take another pledge(954,10)” said(1468,11), as his eyes lighted up
like fire-flies(1493,8)gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”

“The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,” cried
Ahab, with a laugh of derision;—“I(75,8)(69,18)!”

Both were silen(1264,8) as one man. The grey dawn came on,(1002,8)
slumbering crew arose from the(1822,8)bottom, and ere noon the dead
whale was brought(737,8)ship.


CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.

The season(981,9)Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
coming(1682,10)cabin, cast(505,10)aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
ostentatiously handle his spokes(313,9) eager mariners quickly run to
the brac(50,8)would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed
on the nailed doubloon; impatient(1288,9)order to point(381,9)’s
prow(1327,9)equator. In good time(65,11)came. It was hard upon
high noon; and Ahab, seated(819,8)bows of his high-hoisted boat, was
about taking his wonted daily observation(1650,8)sun to determine his
latitude.

Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid(89,11)un seems the blazing
focus(1828,8)glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks
lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon float(1967,9)is
nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of
God’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured
glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging
his(607,8)form(1840,8)roll(540,9)hip, and with his
astrological-looking instrument placed to(1547,8), he remain(713,8)at
posture for some moments to catch the precise instant(1943,8)e sun
should gain its(45,9)meridian. Meantime while his whole attention
was absorbed,(1741,11) was kneeling beneath him on(1017,11) deck,
(290,9)face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun(347,8)m;
only the lid(1000,9)eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was
subdued to an earthly passionlessness. A(1533,9)the desired
(1059,12)was taken;(517,13) pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab
soon calculated what his (1112,8) must be at that(490,16). Then
falling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards(1243,9)and
murmur(662,8)mself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou
tellest me truly where I _am_—but canst thou cast the least hint where
I _shall_ be? Or(54,12)tell where some other thing besides me is
this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This(831,9)thou(378,8)
eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now
beholding him; aye, and(59,10)(54,20) equally (62,9)
the objects(867,8)unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”

Then gazing at hi(1354,10), and handling, one after the other, its
numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
“Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,
and Captains; the world brag(1798,8)e, of thy cunning(695,10); but
what after all(668,12)do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where
thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that
holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not(775,12)one drop of
water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy
impotence thou insultest(1622,8)! Science! Curse(620,12)vain toy;
and cursed be all the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven,
whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are(899,10)scorched(230,9) light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon
are the glances of(194,11); not shot from the crown(1704,8)head, as
if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament.(359,17)
(953,8)!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer will I guide my(1774,8)
way by thee; the level(1975,8)compass(686,10)level dead-reckoning, by
log and by line; _these_ shall conduct me, and show me my place on the
sea. Aye,” lighting(328,10)boa(225,16)thus I trampl(70,8)e,
thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and
destroy thee!”

As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus(141,8)d with his live and
dead feet, a sneering triumph that seeme(531,8)for Ahab, and a
fatalistic despair(53,23)himself—these passed over the
mute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;
while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered
together(1742,8)forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing(743,10)
shouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—square in!”

In an(2032,11)e yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon
her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her
long, ribbed hull,(518,8)as the three Horatii pirouetting on one
sufficient steed.

Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod’s
tumultuous way, and Ahab’s also, as he went lurching alo(411,11).

“I have sat before the dense coal fire and(134,9)it all aglow, full
of its tormented flaming life; and (104,8)een it wane at last, down,
down, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of
thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”

“Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr.
(432,8)—(42,8), not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab
mutter, ‘Here some one thrust(1858,8)cards into(1875,11)hands of
mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.’ And damn me, Ahab,
but thou actest right; live in the ga(1586,8)die in it!”


CHAPTER 119. The Candles.

Warmest climes but n(1852,8) cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal
crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most
effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows
tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in
these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of
all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that
cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.

Towards evening of that day,(1205,11) was torn of her canvas, and
bare-poled was left to fight a(215,8) which had struck her directly
ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roar(204,8)plit with the
thunder, and blazed(29,9) lightning, that showed the disabled masts
fluttering here and there(77,10)rags which the first fury of the
tempest had left for its after sport.

Holding by a shroud(1597,13)s s(1645,8)on the quarter-deck; at
every flash of(235,14) glancing aloft, to see what additional
disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb
and Flask were directing the men(1145,8)higher hoisting and firmer
lash(646,9)e boats. But all their pains(1990,8)naught. Though lifted
to the very top(279,8)cranes, the windward(336,8) boat (Ahab’s) did
not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling
ship’s high teetering side, sto(1423,10)boat’s bottom at the stern,
and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.

“Bad work, bad work! Mr.(609,9),” sai(1835,9)regard(434,8)wreck,
“but the sea will have its way.(1895,8)for one, can’t fight it. You
see,(121,14) a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,
all round the world it runs,(933,8)n comes the spring! But as for me,
all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But
never mind; it’s all in fun: so the old song says;”—(_sings_.)


  Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker(25,8)whale, A’ flourishin’ his
  tail,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the
  Ocean, oh!

  The scud all a flyin’, That’s his flip only foamin’; When he stirs in
  the spicin’(165,58)
 (290,8)(165,16)under splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin’ of
  t(206,8)(161,80)

“Avast Stubb,” cried(770,11)“let(2039,12) sing, and strike his
harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold
thy peace.”

“But I am no(54,13); never said I was(30,14)I am a coward;
and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.
(1037,10)there’s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my
throat. And when that’s done, ten to one(174,8)ye the doxology for a
wind-up.”

“Madman! look(1373,9)my eyes(372,9)hast none of thine own.”

“What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never
mind how foolish?”

“Here!(589,18)seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his
hand towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that(1190,9) comes
from the eastward,(1910,10)course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the
(46,12)he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where
is that stove? In(1854,10)-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his
stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away,(909,8)
must!

“I don’t half understand ye: what’s(2044,8)wind?”

“Yes, yes,(1768,11)Cape of Good Hope(1585,8)shortest way to
Nantucket,” soliloquiz(1140,11) suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s
question. “T(490,8)that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it
into a fair wind that will drive us(634,9)home. Yonder, to windward,
all is blackness of doom;(1022,8)leeward, homeward—I see it lightens up
there; but not with the lightning.”

At that moment in (984,9)e intervals of profound darkness, following
the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same
instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.

“Who’s there?”

“Old(1823,8)!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
pivot-hole; but(571,9) find(67,8)path made plain to him by elbowed
lances of fire.

Now, as(387,14) rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some
ships carry to each mast,(122,17)onduct it(104,10)water. But
as this(39,8)or must descen(65,8)siderable depth, that its end may
avoid all contac(687,11)hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly
towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering
not a little with som(787,9)rigging, and more or less impeding the
vessel’s way(1260,9)ater; because of all this, the lower parts of a
ship’s(944,10)-rods are not always(1430,10); but are generally made
in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up(605,9)
chains outside, or thrown down(645,11)ea, as occasion may require.

“The rods! t(10,8)(2006,16) to the crew,(897,10)admonished
to vigilance(2037,8)vivid(859,11)that had just been darting
flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. “Are they(1787,10)? drop them
over, fore and aft. Quick!”

“Avast(218,9)Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the
weaker side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and
Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let
them be, sir.”

“Look alof(224,10)(1897,8). “The corpusants! t(16,14)”

All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
tri-pointe(501,11)-rod-end(1774,8)ree tapering white flames, each of
the(41,9)ll masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.

“Blast the boat! let it go(779,11)ubb at this instant, as a swashing
sea heaved up under his own(1217,8)craft, so(1396,10)gunwale violently
jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but slipping
backward(652,8)deck, his uplifted eyes caught th(397,8); and
immediately shift(1968,8)tone he cried—(609,15) have mercy on us
all!”

To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear(1453,8)trance(544,8)calm, and(31,9)eeth(1556,8)tempest(76,12)imprecate curses
from the topsail-(765,9), when most they teeter over to a seet(496,8); but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when
God’s(724,9)finger has been lai(448,9)ship; when His “Mene, Mene,
Tekel Upharsin”(65,10)wove(1550,12)hrouds and(1034,8)dage.

While this pallidness wa(156,10)aloft, few words were heard (336,8)
enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stoo(667,9)forecastle, all
their eyes gleam(1007,12)pale phosphorescence, like a far away
constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the
(1082,9)jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and
seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted
mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely
gleamed as if they too had been(1513,8)by(1576,11); while lit up by
the preternatural(302,8)Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue
flames on his body.

The tableau all waned at last(1596,8)e(664,12)aloft; and once more
the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment
or two passed, when(1874,9), going forward, push(591,11)some one.
It was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man;(1056,9)thy cry; it was not
the same(1291,8)song.”

“No, no, it wasn’t; I sai(986,9)(1427,24) all; and I
hope(1397,10), still. But do they only(1495,15)long faces?—have
they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr.(332,9)—but it’s too dark
to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
of good luck; for those masts are root(510,8)hold that is going to be
chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will
work up(1411,10)masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our thre(175,8)will
yet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promis(287,8).”

At that moment(723,9) caught sight of Stubb’s face slowly beginning
to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!”(947,9)
more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
sup(1169,9)ness in their pallor.

“T(782,34),” cried Stubb, again.

At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon(1886,9)flame,
the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away
from him(1435,8)near by,(1916,9) arched and overhanging rigging, where
they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number(253,8)seamen,
arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulou(766,8)a
knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various
enchanted attitude(857,8)the standing, or step(78,8) running
skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained(1072,8)to the deck; but all
their eyes upcast.

“Aye, aye, men!(607,8)Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white
flame but lights the way(135,8)White Whale! Hand me(1258,9)inmast
links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat(1749,8)
it; bloo(1767,10)fire! So.”

Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot
upon (811,10); and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,
he stood erect bef(1127,8)lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.

“Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian
once did worship, till(1986,9)acramental act so burn(847,9)e, that
to this hour I bear the scar; I now know(52,9)(182,15), and I
(40,11)at thy right(157,8) is defiance. To neither love nor
reverence wilt thou be kind; and e’en for hate thou canst but kill; and
all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,
placeless power; but(924,8)last gasp of my earthquake life will
dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of
the personified impersonal, a (12,8)ity stands here. Though but a
point at best; whencesoe’er I came; wher(20,10)go; yet while I
earthly live, the queenly(130,13)lives in me, and feels her royal
rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of
love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere(2005,8)l(478,8)and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted
worlds, there’s that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou
(845,14)of thy fire thou madest(339,9)like a true child of
fire, I breathe it back to thee.”

[_Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap
lengthwise to thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes
his eyes, his right hand pressed hard (1445,8)m._]

“(927,21) (927,17)said I not so? Nor was it wrung
from me; nor do I now drop these links. T(1113,11)lind; but I can
then grope(40,13)consume(42,11) then be ashes. Take the
homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands.(1868,9)not take it. The
(433,9)(454,9)through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my
whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning
ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I tal(657,10) Light though
thou b(1629,8)leapest out of darkness(391,8)am(19,9) leaping out of
light,(22,15) thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?
There burn th(777,8)!(946,9) magnanimous! now I do glory in my
genealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know
not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but
thine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself
unbegotten; certainly(69,13)thy beginning(71,29)un. I know that of me, which t(157,16)of(133,8), o(1334,8)omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond the(612,8)clear
(1396,8)to whom all thy eternity is but time,(30,9)creativeness
mechanical. Through(104,9)y flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly
see i(1556,11) foundling fir(793,8)hermit immemorial, thou too hast
thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with
haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up(1683,8)ck the sky! I leap
(1536,8)e; I burn(1554,9)e; would fain be welded(32,12)defyingly
I worship thee!”

“The boat! t(10,8)” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”

Ahab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed
in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected(648,8)his whale-boat’s
bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather
sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there n(1021,8)a
levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent(325,8) burned there
like a serpent’s tongue,(418,9) grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is
against thee(449,9); forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill
continued; let me square the yards, while we may(552,9), and make a
fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”

Overhearing(678,11)the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
braces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast
mate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But
dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatc(56,8)
burning(901,10)Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to
transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end.
Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking(847,10)fiery dart
that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:—

“All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and
heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye
may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out
the last fear!” And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the
flame.

As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of
some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it
so much the more unsafe, because (33,17)a mark for
thunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab’s many of the mariners did
run from him in a terror of dismay.


CHAPTER 120. The Deck Towards the End(96,8)First Night Watch.

_Ahab standing(1450,8)helm.(1485,10)approaching him._

“We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working
loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”

“Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I’d sway them up
now.”

“Sir!—in God’s name!—(103,8)Well.”

“The anchors are(204,8), sir(169,10)get them inboard(171,19)(1153,9)r(18,10)but lash everything. The wind rises,
but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Qui(1439,9)ee to it.—By

_Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over
t(791,11)there hanging._

“No, Stubb; you may pou(1682,8)knot there as much as you please, but
you will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how
long ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn’t you once say
that whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra
on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder
barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; d(212,10)say
so(1249,9), suppose I did? What then? I’ve part changed my flesh since that
time, why not my mind? Besides(96,8)ing we _are_(216,36)(207,16); how the devil could the(249,10)get
afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty
red hair, but you couldn’t get afire now. Shake yourself; you’re
Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat
collar. Do(448,9)ee, the(628,8)for these extra risks the Marine
I(622,9)companies hav(48,8)guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask.
But hark, again, and I’ll answer ye the other thing. First t(288,8)
leg off from the crown of (1099,10) here, though, so I can pass the
rope; now listen. What’s the mighty difference between holding a mast’s
lightning-rod in the storm(1958,8)anding close by a mast that hasn’t
got any (77,14)at all in a storm?(448,16)you
timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder(296,8)rod, unless the
mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in
a hundred carries ro(1928,8)Ahab,—aye, man, and all of us,—were in no
more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten
thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I(1230,8)
you would have every man(490,8)world go about with a small(539,15)running up the corner of his hat, like a militia
officer’s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why
don’t ye be sensible, Flask? it’s easy to(33,12); why (59,8),
then? any man with half an eye can(95,12).”

“I don’t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”

“Yes, when a fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard(192,15), that’s
a fact. And I am about drench(1808,8)this spray. Never mind; catch the
turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down thes(1168,8)s
now as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two
anchors her(454,8), seems like ty(1178,8)n’s hands(540,8)him. And

fists, hey(1054,8) hold they have, too! I wond(1701,9), whether the
world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long
cabl(1511,9). There, hammer that knot down, and we’ve done. So; next
to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say,
just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at
long-togs so(2010,9)but s(616,10), a long tailed coat ought always
to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails taper(686,11)at way,
serve to carry off the water, d’ye see. Same with cocked hats; the
cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and
tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a
beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my (105,9) overboard; Lord,
Lor(1879,8)the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!
This is a nasty night, lad.”


CHAPTER 122. Midnight Aloft.—Thunder and L(1616,8).

_The main-top-sail yard_.—_Tashtego passing new(1177,8)s around it_.

“Um, um, um. Stop(234,8)under! Plenty too much(25,8) up here. What’s
the use of(60,8)? (91,12)We don’t wan(95,9); we want rum;
give us a glass of rum.(72,11)!(302,14)3. The Musket.

Dur(2015,8)most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod’s
jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by
its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached
to it—for(1590,11)slack—because some play(130,8)tiller was
indispensable.

In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock
to the blast, it is by no means(1444,10)to see the needles in the
compasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus(1973,8)e
(433,8); at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice
the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a
sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted
emotion.

Some hours after midnight,(705,12) abated so much(1188,9)rough the
strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and the
other aft—the shivered remnant(855,9)jib and fore and(1180,14)s
were cut adrift from the spars(1948,8)nt eddying away to leeward, like
the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast(924,8)winds
when that storm-tossed bird is on(1514,8)g.

The three correspond(1364,8)sails were now bent and reefed, and a
storm-trysail was set fur(345,8); so(1634,10)ship soon wen(465,9)

East-south-east—which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
given(1262,8)(865,8). For d(1410,10)violence(1399,8)gale, he had only
steered according to its vicissitudes. But as(165,8)now bringing the
ship as near her course as possible, watch(1564,8)compass meanwhile,
lo! a good sign!(2027,9) seemed coming(1177,8)stern; aye, the foul
breeze became fair!

Instantly the yards were squared,(1590,8)lively song of “_Ho! the fair
wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!_” the crew singing for joy, that so
promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
preceding it.

In compliance(1429,9) standing order of his commander—to report
immediately, and at any on(564,9)twenty-four hours, any decided
change in the affair(2023,9)deck,—(1260,9)had no sooner trimmed the
yards(1981,8)breeze—however reluctantly and gloomily,—than he
mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab(1326,8)circumstance.

Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
moment. The cabin lamp—taking long swings this way and that—was burning
fitful(405,8)casting fitful shadows(1799,10)old man’s bolted door,—a
thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper panels. The
isolated subterraneousnes(1654,9)cabin made a certain humming silence
to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the
elements. The loaded muskets(640,8)rack were shiningly revealed, as
they stood upright against the(1912,9)bulkhead.(1961,10)was an
honest,(62,9)man; but out(2009,12)’s heart, at that instant when
he saw the(195,8), there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so
blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that (1677,8)(140,8)he
hardly knew it for itself.

“He would have shot me once,” he murmured, “ye(195,8)’s the very
musket that he pointed at me;—that on(1211,13)udded stock; let me
touch it—lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly
lances,(351,8)(57,8)(1410,9)hake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye,
aye; and powder(1271,8)pan;—that’s not good. Best spill it?—wait. I’ll
cure myself of this. I’ll hold(534,11) boldly while I think.—I come
(1480,9) a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and

shall this crazed(1652,8) be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship’s
company down to doom with him?—Yes, it would make him the wilful
murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come(429,8)deadly harm;
and(29,9)(25,11), my soul swears(75,11)will, if Ahab have
his way. If, then, he were this(1517,8)—put asid(1194,8)crim(1364,8)not
be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,—i(1868,8)
he’s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I
can’t withstand thee(221,8)old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance;
not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; (588,9)thou scornest. Flat
obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest(1448,8)nd say’st the men have vow’d thy vow;(35,8)all of us are Ahabs.
Great God forbid!—But is there no other way? no lawful way?—M(702,8)a
prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this(860,8)’s living
power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say(666,8)
pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained(954,8)
ring-bolts on this cabin floor(1459,11)be more hideous than a caged
tiger, then. I c(788,8) endure the sight;(28,11)possibly fly his
howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me
on the long intolerable voyage. What(1001,8)remains? The land is
hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone
here upon an open sea, with two oceans and(1374,9)continent between me
and law.—Aye, aye, ’tis so.—Is heaven a (1363,9)when its(1534,10)
strikes a would-be(47,10)in his bed, tindering sheets and skin
together?—And would I be(121,11)(1341,8)if”—and slowly, stealthily,
and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket’s end against
the door.

“On this level, Ahab’s hammock swings within; his head t(1524,9)A
touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.—Oh
Mary! Mary!—boy! boy! boy!—But if I wake thee not to death(1423,9),
who can tell to what unsounded deeps(163,9)’s body this day week may
sink, with all the crew! (1286,9), where art Thou? Shall I? shall
I?—The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails
are reefed and set; she heads her course.”

“Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!”

Such(1964,8)e sounds that now came hurtling from out the(1433,10)
tormented sleep, as if(362,12)voice had caus(674,9)ng dumb dream
to speak.

The yet levell(711,9) shook like a drunkard’s arm(733,8) the panel;
(655,9)seemed wrestling with an angel; but turn(229,9)(802,8), he
(854,11)death-tube in its rack, and left t(902,8).

“He’s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell
him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know’st what to say.”


CHAPTER 124. The Needle.

Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod’s gurgling track, pushed her on
like giants’ palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded
so, that sky and air(512,8)vast outbellying sails; the whole world
boomed before the wind. Muffled(217,8)full(319,9)light, the
invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;
where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned
Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a
crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.

Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time
the tet(1894,8)ip loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to
eye the bright sun’s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly
settled(464,9)tern(101,12)behind, and saw the(103,8)earward
place, and how the same yellow rays were blend(1207,9)his undeviating
wake.

“Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot
of(170,8). Ho, ho! all ye nations(791,8)my prow, I br(1089,8)sun to
ye! Yoke o(810,8)rther(1079,8); hallo! a tandem, I drive(144,8)!”

But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards
the helm, huskily demanding(373,10)hip was heading.

“East-sou-east, sir,” said the frightened steersman.

“Thou liest!” smiting him(441,10)clenched fist. “Heading East at this
hour(1342,8)morning, and(355,9)astern?”

Upon this every soul was confounded;(489,9)phenomenon just then
observed by Ahab had unaccountably escape(902,8)one else; but its very
blinding palpableness must have been the cause.

Thrusting his head half way into the binnacl(1049,8)caught one glimpse(690,8)compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost
seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two
(136,9) pointed East(447,10)Pequod(1372,8)infallibly going West.

But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the
old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened
before. Mr.(251,9), last night’s thunder(1373,8)our(396,10)—that’s
all. Thou hast(1881,8)now heard of such a thing, I take it.”

“Aye; but never(1944,8)has it(172,9) to me(939,17)pale mate,
gloomily.

Here, it must needs be sai(1750,8)accidents like this have in more than
one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
developed(1013,9)ariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one
with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much
marvelled at, that such things should be. Instances wh(678,8)lightning
has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some (1660,8)pars
and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more
fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before
(435,9)steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle.
But in either case,(200,12)never again, of itself, recovers the
original(192,8)thus marred or lost; and if(1342,13)(1310,10) be
affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be(1685,8)ship;
even w(513,9)owermost one inserted(1482,10)kelson.

Deliberately s(1380,10)fore(1524,15)and eyeing the transpointed(1385,10), the old man, (777,9)sharp of his extended hand, now took
the precise bearing(648,9)un, and satisfied(538,10)needles were
exactly inverted, shouted out his orders(1928,9)ship’s course to be
changed accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once(1162,8)(1623,8)
thrust her undaunted bows(1874,10)opposing wind,(148,10)upposed fair
one had only been juggling her.

Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts,(1850,10)said
nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and
Flask—who in some small degree (2003,8)hen to be sharing his
feelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. A(444,10)men, though some
of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than(36,11)
of Fate. But as (1769,11), the pagan harpooneers remained almost
wholly unimpressed; or if (17,9), it was only with a certain(1255,8)sm shot(953,9)ir congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.

For a space(918,12) walked the deck in rolling reveries. But
chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
sight-tubes(1616,8)quadrant he had the day(1138,8)dashed to(158,9).

“Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked
thee, and to-day th(1417,12)would fain have(55,8) me. So, so. But
Ahab is lord over the level(1745,11)yet. Mr.(871,9)—a lance without
a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest(1923,9)ail-maker’s(1260,8).
Quick!”

Accessory, perhaps,(320,8)impulse dictat(1465,9)hing he was now about
to do, were(646,8) prudential motives, whose object might have been to
revive the spirits(1527,8)crew by a stroke(1551,8)subtile skill, in a
matter so wondrous as tha(279,9)(1505,8)(1871,10). Besid(1669,11)
man well knew that to steer by(1732,13)(1607,8)(1105,9)clumsily
practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious
sailors,(510,8) some shudderings and evil portents.

“Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him
(498,9)s(883,8)demanded, “my(1347,8)e thunder turned old Ahab’s
needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make on(479,9)own,
that will point as true as any.”

Abashed glances of servile wond(1747,8)ex(1949,8)by(799,9)ors, as
this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited(1843,10)magic
might follow. But(1837,10)looked away.

With a blow from the(975,9) Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
lanc(1177,8)hen handing(1282,8)mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
him hold it upright(622,10)its touch(1025,8)deck. Then, with the
maul, after repeatedly smi(1081,9)upper end(513,9)(145,8), he
placed the blu(851,11) endwise on(292,8) of it, and less strongly
hammered that, several tim(984,8)mate still hold(1239,8)rod as before.
Then going through some small strange motions with it—whether
indispensable(397,10)gnetizing(1436,9)teel, or merely intended to
augment the awe(1795,8)crew, is uncertain—he called for linen thread;
and mov(533,11)binnacle, slipped out the two revers(1232,10) there,
and horizontally suspended(1638,10)needle by its middle, over one of
(1847,11)-cards. At first,(739,11)went round and round, quivering
and vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when
Ahab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly
back(962,10)(350,10)and pointing his stretched arm towards it,
exclaimed,—“Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lor(1031,8) level
loadstone! The sun is East(1058,8)at(1775,8) swears it!”

One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
persuade such ignorance as theirs, and o(110,22)slunk
away.

In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his
fatal pride.


CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.

While now the fated Pequod(544,10)so long afloat this voyage, the log
and line had but very seldom(614,8) use. Owing to a confident reliance
upon other means of determin(1421,8)vessel’(728,9)some merchantmen,
and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave
the log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form’s sake
than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the
course steer(1994,11)hip, as well as the presumed average rate of
progression every hour. It(1037,10)thus(1763,9) Pequod. The wooden
reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the
rail(1556,11)after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and
wind had war(28,8)all the elements had combined to rot a thing that
hung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he
happened to glance(462,10)reel, not many hours after(1827,11)
scene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his
frantic oath ab(1767,8)level log (938,8). The ship was sailing
plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.

“Forward, there! Heave(1049,8)!”

Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
“Take(334,11)one of ye, I’ll heave.”

They went(1644,9)the extreme stern, on(829,9)’s lee side, where the
deck,(775,10)oblique energy(1666,8)wind, was now almost dipping into
the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.

The(231,8) took(563,11)and holding it high up,(1020,8)projecting
handle-ends(1823,8)spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so
stood(1021,10)(993,12)hang(1193,8)wards, till Ahab advanced to
him.

Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him(639,9)line, made bold to
speak.

“Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
spoiled it.”

“’Twill hold, old gentleman. L(66,16), have they (72,8)thee?
Thou seem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou(145,8)I hold(559,10), sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey
hairs of mine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’(1951,11)ith a
superior, who’ll ne’er confess.”

“What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s
granite-founded College; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where wert
thou born?”

“In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.”

“Excellent! Thou’st hit the world by tha(401,8)know not, sir, but I was born there.(128,11)(115,13)hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’s a man
from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;
which is sucked in—by what? Up(1376,10)reel! The dead, blind wall
butts all inquiring heads at last.(74,9)it! So.”

The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
dragging line astern,(1701,8)n, instantly,(2025,9) began to whirl. In
turn, jerkingly raised and lowered(1491,8)rolling(1902,8), the towing
resistance(1664,8)log caused(1260,8) reelman to stagger strangely.

“Hold hard!”

Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the
tugging(363,9)gone.

“I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles(581,10)the mad
sea parts(236,8)-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;
reel up,(1893,8). And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and
mend thou(1569,9). See to(1477,8)There he goes now; to him nothing’s happened; but to me, the skewer
seems loosening out(2000,8)middl(507,9)world(245,9), haul in,
(249,8)! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and(762,10)slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?”

“Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip’s missing.
Let’s see now if ye haven’t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags
hard; I guess he’s holding on. Jerk him(549,8)!(18,9) off; we haul
in no cowards here. Ho! there’s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet!
a(11,9) cut it off—we(436,8)(102,18)Captain Ahab! sir,
sir! here’s Pip, trying to get on board again.”

“Peace, thou crazy loon,” cried the(786,8), seizing him(1162,8)arm.
“Away(440,10)quarter-deck!”

“The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,” muttered Ahab, advancing.
“Hands off(546,8)at holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?

“Aste(1795,8), sir, astern! Lo! lo!”

“And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to
sieve through! W(149,17)”

“Bell-boy, sir; ship’s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One
hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high—looks
cowardly—quickest known by that! D(130,17)Who’s seen Pip the
coward?(1309,10)can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens!
look down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned
him, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab’s cabin shall be Pip’s
home henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost cent(100,8)
thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let’s
down.”

“What’s this?(1065,8)velvet shark-skin,” intently gazing at Ahab’s
hand, and feeling it. “Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind(755,8)
as this, perhaps he had ne’er been lost! This seems(1800,8)sir, as a
man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth
now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the
white, for I will not l(628,8)go.”

“Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I(1055,8)thereby drag thee to worse
horrors than are(1551,8)ome, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in
gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods
oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not
what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come!
I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than(156,8)I grasped an
Emperor’s(1725,8)re go two daft ones now(1711,12)the old(1836,8). “One daft with
strength, the other(30,10) weakness. But(1984,8)the end of the
rotten line—all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a
new line al(724,8). I’ll see Mr. Stubb about it.”


CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.

Steering now south-eastward by(1315,8)levelled steel, and her progress
solely determine(61,17) log and line; the Pequod held on her
path towards the Equator. Making so long a passag(1891,9) such
unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways
impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all
these seemed the strange calm(780,8)preluding some riotous and
desperate scene.

At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were,(644,8)Equatorial fishing-grou(1553,8)in the deep darkness that goes before
the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—then
headed by Flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
unearthly—like half-articulated wail(1134,8)the ghosts of all Herod’s
murdered Innocents—that one and all, they started from their reveries,
and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all
transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild
cry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part(1183,8)crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers
(132,9)unappalled. Yet the grey(1375,8)—the oldest mariner of
all—declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the
voices of newly drowned men(738,8)sea.

Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey(767,8)hen he
came(896,8)deck;(323,8)then recounted to him(758,9), not
unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus
explained the wonder.

Those(908,10)ands(1085,10)had passed(317,9) resort of great
numbers of seal(526,8)ome young seals that had lost their dams, or
some dam(39,22)cubs, mu(1763,8)risen nigh(1255,10)and
kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of
wail. But this only the more affected some of them, because most
mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about(311,9)rising not
only(1102,12)peculiar tones when in distress, but also(1155,9)
human look of(1173,8)ound heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen
peeringly uprising(1248,9) water alongside. I(823,9), under certain
circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.

But the bod(1460,12)crew were destined to receive a most plausible
confirmatio(997,9)fate of on(463,8)ir number that morning. At
sun-rise this man went from(1055,12) to his mast-head at the fore;
and whether(1028,10)at he was not yet half wak(1620,8)his sleep (for
sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state),(117,18)us
(775,8) man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had
not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard—a cry and a
rushing—and looking up(1879,8)aw a falling phantom(1442,8)air; and
(55,8)down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles(1510,8)blu(969,8)
sea.

The life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropp(2032,11) stern, where it
always hung obedient to a cunning spr(349,8) no hand rose to seize it,
and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it
slowly fill(1557,10)at parched wood also filled at its every pore; and
the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor(1780,8)bottom, as if to
yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.

And thus the first man(1042,8)Pequod(954,8)unted the mast to look out
for the White Whale, on(20,16)’s own(1404,10)ground; that man
was swallowed up(1112,8)deep. But few, perhaps(224,8)t of that at the
time. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at
least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of
evil(1307,9)uture, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.
They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they
had heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay(971,8)ost(976,10) was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see
to it;(266,8)no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in
the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisi(1781,8)
voyage, all hands were impati(410,9)y toil but what(214,11)ly
connected with its final end, whatev(1792,9)ight prove to be;
therefore(668,12)going to leave the ship’s stern unprovid(117,8)a
buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a
hint concerning his coffin.

“A(504,11)of a coffin!” cried(500,9), starting.

“Rather queer, that, I should say,” said Stubb.

“It will make a good enough one(47,8)Flask, “the carpenter here can
arrange it easily.”

“Bring it up; there’s nothing else for it(148,10)(210,8)after a
melancholy pause. “Rig it,(134,10); do not look at me so—the coffin,
I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.”

“And shall I nail down the lid, sir?” mov(427,8)hand as with a hammer.

“Aye(81,17)caulk the seams(79,33)

“Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a(668,14)(364,11) and
no more.—Mr. Stubb, Mr.(582,8)come forward with me.”

“He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he
baulks. Now I don’t like this. I(741,8)leg for Captain Ahab, and he
wears it like a gentleman; but(69,10)bandbox for(988,9)(69,10)on’t put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for(797,9)with
that coffin? And now I’m ordered to(209,9)(1066,12)it. It’s like
turning an old coat;(1264,10)bring the flesh on the other side now. I
(333,15) cobbling sort of business—(377,13)it at all; it’s
undignified; it’s not my place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we
are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,
fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at
the beginning, and is(661,8)middle when midway, and comes to an end(72,8)conclusion; not a cobbler’s job, that’s at(57,8)in(104,11),
and(784,8)(148,9)(801,8)end. It’s the old woman’s tricks to be
giving(475,10)jobs. Lord! what an affection all(75,8)en have for
tinkers. I know(632,8)woman of sixty-five who ran away(1880,9)ald-headed young tinker once. And(266,8)the reason I never would work
for lonely widow(171,11)ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the
Vineyard; they might have taken it into thei(108,9)old heads to run

me see. N(1688,16);(1626,16);(1552,23)

the ship’s stern. Were ever such things done before(1824,8)(1226,8)Some
superstitious old(2000,10)s, now, would be tied u(408,8) rigging, ere
they would do the job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock;(1242,9)budge. Cruppered(182,14)! Sailing about(2035,8)grave-yard
tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and
card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses(91,9) by the month, or
by(264,8), or(32,8)profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore
of our work, unless it be too confounded(1545,9), and then we stash it
if we can. Hem! I’ll(427,11), now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s
see—how many(1270,8)ship’s company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any
way,(94,13) thirty separate, Turk’s(1150,8)life-lines, each three
feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down,
there’ll b(136,9)lively fellows all fighting for on(90,8), a sight
not seen very often benea(960,8)un! Come hammer, caulking-iron,

following him._

“Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand
complies with my humor more genially than that boy.—Middle aisle of a
church! What’s here?”

“Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck’s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the

“Thank ye, man. Thy(549,9)ies handy(820,8)vault.”

“Sir? The(525,9)? oh! So it does, sir, s(17,9).”

“Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did n(333,8)stump come(464,8)y
shop?”

“I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?”

“Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?”

“Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as(1860,9) for Queequeg; but
they’ve set me now to turning it into something else.”

“Then tell me;(177,15)n arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs(1591,9)
next da(548,8)s to clap them in, and yet again l(684,8)s out of those
sam(1411,8)s? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
jack-of-all-trades.”

“But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do(352,8) gods again. Hark ye, dos(541,11)ever sing working about a
coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the
craters for volcanoes;(1969,8) grave-digger(1889,8)play sings, spade in

“S(259,8)? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that(709,9) reason why(155,18)made music must have been because there
was none in his spade, sir. But the(1618,10)mallet is fu(1559,8). Hark

“Fait(497,8)I’ve——”(22,8)?(1666,8)that?”

“Why, f(50,11)it’s only a sort of exclamation-like—that’s all,
sir.”

“Um, um; go on.”

“I was about to say, sir, that——(1606,8)thou a silk-worm?(754,11)spin thy own shroud(1150,10)yself?
Look at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these trap(1215,9)sight.”

“He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
latitudes. I’ve(452,9)at the Isle of Albemarle, one of the

professor of musical glasses—tap, tap!”

(_Ahab to himself_.)

“T(1067,10)ight! (17,11)ound! The greyheaded woodpecker tapping
the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that
thing rests on two line-tubs,(1292,9)tow-lines. A most malicious wag,
that fellow. Rat-tat! So man’s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all
(17,8)s! What(1320,8)real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here
now’s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the
expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A
life-buoy of(1448,9)! Does it go further? Can it be that in some
spiritual sense(1405,12)is, after all, but an immortality-preserver!
I’ll think of that. But no. So far gone am I(2042,8)dark side of earth,
that its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain
twilight to me. Will ye never have don(1698,12), with that accursed
sound? I go below; let me not see(1253,8)ing here when I return again.
Now, then, Pip, we’ll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous
philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduit(33,10)(26,9)worlds
must empty into thee!”


CHAPTER 128. The Pequod Meets The Rachel.

Next day, a large ship, t(37,9), was descried, bearing directly down
upon t(107,9), all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time
(67,10) was making good speed through the water; but as the
broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from
the smitten hull.

“Bad news; she brings bad news,” muttered the old Manxman. But ere her
commander, who(746,8)rumpet to mouth, stood up(1822,8)boat; ere he
could hopefully hail, Ahab’s voice was heard.

“Hast seen the White Whale?”

“Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?”

Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;
and would then have fain boarded the(517,9), when(19,13)
captain(1897,8), having stopped his vessel’s way, was seen descending
(1242,8). A few keen pulls, and(385,9)-hook soon clinched the
Pequod’s main-chain(58,8)e sprang to the deck. Immediately he was
recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew(1483,8) formal salutation
was exchanged.

“Wher(527,8)?—not killed!(12,12)” cried Ahab, closely advancing.
“How was it?”

It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoo(1862,9)day previous,
while three(1895,8)(1006,8)’s boats were engaged with a shoal of
whales, which had led them some four or five mil(1457,11) ship; and(135,9)ey were yet in swift chase to(1169,9), the white hump and head
of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out(268,8)water, not very far to
leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been
instantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this
fourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all—(515,8)o have succeeded in
fastening—at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell
anything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;
and then a swift gleam of bubbling whit(1684,9)and after that nothing
more; whence it was conclud(774,8)the stricken whale must have
indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. T(962,8)
some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals
were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her
three far(801,12) boats—ere going in ques(761,9)fourth one in the
precisely opposite direction—(941,8) had not only been necessitated to
leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to
increase her(616,10)from it. But the rest of her crew being at last
safe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail on (12,8)—(632,8)e
missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beac(435,8)every
other man aloft(1434,8)look-ou(207,9)ough when she had thus sailed a
sufficient(890,10)to gain the presumed plac(1486,9)absent ones when
last seen;(116,8)she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all
around h(941,8)not finding (1075,8), had again dashed on; again
paused, and(1316,9)her boats; and(160,12)(271,9)continued doing
till daylight; yet not the least glimps(1758,9)(467,8)keel (1455,9)seen.

The story told,(1807,13) Captain immediately went on to reveal his
object in boarding the Pequod. He desir(1976,9)hip to unite(1165,9)
own(1050,8)search; by sailing over(28,8)(1898,24)
apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.

“I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one
in that(389,9)boat wore off that(358,8)’s best coat; mayhap, his
watch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two
pious whale-ships cruising after on(553,10)whale-boat(1448,8)height
of the whaling season? See,(255,8)only see how pale he looks—pale in
the very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’t the coat—it(1748,10) been
the—”

“My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I
conjure”—here exclaimed(772,22)to Ahab, who thus far had
but icily received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me
charter your ship—I will gladly pay for it, and roun(24,14)—if
there be no other way—f(125,25)only—only that—you
must, oh, you must, and you _shall_ do this thing.”

“His son!” cri(788,8), “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the
coat and watch—what says Ahab? We must s(1900,11)y.”

“He’s drowned with(1832,11)n ’em, last night,” said the old Manx
sailor standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”

Now(1093,8)shortly turned out, what made this incident(1719,8)Rachel’s
the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was on(1800,8)
(1112,10)son(786,11) number(1567,16)boat’s crew; but among
(49,18)ot(1717,8)’s crews, at the same time, bu(2039,8)
other hand, separated from the ship dur(1589,8)dark vicissitudes(209,8)chase, there(1737,9) still another son; as that for a time, the
wretched father was plunged to the bottom(1851,8)cruellest perplexity;
which was only solved for him by his chief mate’s instinctively
adopt(1827,8)ordinary procedure of a(1452,11) in such emergencies,
that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to
pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown
constitutional reason, had refrain(488,8)mentioning all this, and not
till forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he allude to his one yet
(1885,10)y; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose(518,9)ith the
earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s paternal love, had
thus early sought to initiate him(1879,8)perils and wonders of a
vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it
unfrequently occur, that(193,10)(475,8)s will send a son of such
tender age away(949,9)m, for a protracted three or four years’ voyage
in som(1084,8)ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a
whaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a
father’s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and
concern.

Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;
and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without
the least quivering of his own.

“I will not go(1807,12)(183,8), “till you say _aye_ to me. Do to me
as you would have me do to you(737,8)like case. For _you_ too have a
boy, Captain Ahab—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a
child of your old age too—Yes, yes, you relent; I see it—run, run, men,
now, and stand by to square(948,8)yards.”

“Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that
prolongingly moulded every word—“(282,8)Gardiner, (446,11)do it.
Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I
forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look(2035,8)binnacle
watch, and in three minutes(2028,8)is present instant warn off all
(826,8)s: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.”

Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
leav(1955,8)strang(1801,9) transfixed at this unconditional and utter
rejection(902,8)so (1639,8)suit. But starting from his enchantment,
(511,8) silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepp(218,11)
boat, and returned(1864,8)ship.

Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as(289,13)vessel
was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and t(12,8)t every dark spot,
however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung
round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat
against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the
while, her masts and(174,12)thickly clustered with men, as three
tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.

But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly
saw(1961,8)is(1995,9)t so wept with spray, still remained(1702,9)comfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were
not.


CHAPTER 129. The Cabin.

(_Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow._)

“Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is
coming when Ahab would not scare thee(1019,8)m, yet(35,11)have thee
by him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my
malady. Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most
desired health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,
as if thou wert th(1383,9). Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own
screwed chair; another screw to it,(432,11)be.”

“No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for
your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain
a part of ye.”

“Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigo(522,8) fadeless
fidelity of man!—and a black! and crazy!—but methinks like-cures-like
applies to him too; he grows so sane again.”

“They tell(249,8), that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
drowned bones now show white, for(1369,8) blackness(1888,8)living skin.
But I will never(119,8)y(155,8)as(153,11)him. Sir, I must go with
ye.”

“If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab’s purpose keels up in him.
(1094,12)no; it canno(666,9)Oh good master,(8,8) master!

“Weep so, and(225,8)murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still
know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!—Met! True art
thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless
thee; and if it come to that,—(49,13)s(1363,8), let what will

“Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,—but I’m alone. Now
were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he’s missing. Pip! Pip!
Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip? He(1286,8) up here; let’s try the
door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there’s no opening
it. It(110,9)the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and(31,8)
this (1503,13) was mine. Here, then, I’ll seat me, against the
transom,(1311,8)ship’s full middle, all her keel and her three masts
before m(118,9)our old sailors say(98,8)ir black seventy-fours

captains and lieutenants. Ha! what’s this? epaulets!(10,10) the

this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters(1468,8)
join me.”


CHAPTER 130. The Hat.

(1642,8)that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have
chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there;
now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude
where his tormenting wound had been inflicted;(322,11) vessel had
been spoken which on(122,10)day preceding had actually encountered
Moby Dick;—a(428,13)ll his successive meetings with various ships
contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which
the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned(1620,8);
now it was that there lurked a something(1649,8)old man’s eyes, which
it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting
polar star, which(845,8) the livelong, arctic, six months’ night
sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now
fixedly gleamed down(1189,10)constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It
domineered(1204,10)m so,(557,10)their bodings, doubts, misgivings,
fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a
single spear or leaf.

In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck(42,8)
(42,10)check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed
ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time,(711,8)clamped
mortar of(526,8)iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the
deck, ever consciou(848,10)(820,11)despot eye was on them.

But did you deeply scan him in his(1373,9)ret confidential hours; when
he thought no glance but on(115,9)him; t(1797,9)ould have seen that
even as(803,8)eyes so awed the crew’s, the inscrutable Parsee’s glance
awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.
Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah
now; such ceaseless shudderings shook(286,8)at the men looked dubious
at him; half uncertain, as it seemed(1403,10)indeed he were a mortal
substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast(1152,10)deck by some unseen
being’s body. And that(64,8)was always hovering there. For not by
night, even, had(307,9) ever certainly been known to slumber, or go
below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan
but wondrous eyes did plainly say—We two watchmen never rest.

Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step(1516,9)
deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing(936,8)pivot-hole,
or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,—the
main-mast and the mizen;(565,9)they saw him(139,13)the
cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced(610,14), as if to step;
his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he
stood,(29,9)the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung
in his hammock; yet hidden(1816,11)(174,9)ing hat, the(506,8)never
tell unerringly(945,8), for all this,(223,9) were really closed at
times; or(1009,9)he was still intently scanning them; no matter,
though he stood so(1700,8)scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and
the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew(1110,8)at stone-carved
coat and hat. The clothe(1743,11)night had wet, the next day’s
sunshine dri(603,8)him; and so, day after day,(512,10) after night;
he went no more(476,11)(832,8); whatev(372,8)nted from the cabin
that thing he sent for.

He ate(362,9)ame open air; that (509,8)two only meals,—breakfast and
dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly
grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still
grow idly on at naked base, though perished(609,8)upper verdure. But(654,9)is whole life was now become one watch on deck; and(102,8)the
Parsee’s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these
two(1578,8)eemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals
some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent
spell(140,8)secretly to join the twain; openly, and(163,8)awe-struck
crew, they(216,8)pole-like asunder. If by day they chanc(258,11)
one word;(1758,9), dumb men were both, so far as concerned the
slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours,(450,9)a
single hail(209,8)tood far part(618,10)starlight; Ahab in his
(1690,8) the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each
other; as if(1342,8)Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab(694,11) his abandoned substance.

And yet, somehow, did Ahab—in(707,8) proper self, as daily, hourly,
and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab
seemed an independent lord;(331,13)ut his slave. Still again both(71,8)yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driv(1728,10)the lean
shade siding the solid rib. For be this(477,8)what he may, all rib and
keel was solid Ahab.

At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
from aft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all thr(1218,8) day, till after
sunset and after twilight,(1602,10)voice every hour, at(1962,8)iking
of the helmsman’s bell,(172,10)—“What d’ye see?—sharp! sharp!”

But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac
old man(1432,8)distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly
all except the Pagan harpooneers; he(1532,11)doubt, even, whether
Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But
if these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from
verbally express(813,8), however his actions might seem to hint them.

“I will have(766,11)sight(752,8)whale myself,”—he said. “Aye! Ahab
must(68,10)doubloon!” and with(1199,9)hands he rigged a nest of
basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
block, to secure(1971,8)main-mast head, he received the two ends of the
downward-reeved rope; and attaching one(1332,8)basket prepared a pin
for the other end, in order to fasten it(951,8)rail. This done, with
that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round
upon(810,9), sweeping from(202,8)(172,9); pausing his glance long
upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then
settl(90,8)firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the
rope, sir—I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.” Then arranging his
person(1978,8)basket, he g(773,8)word for them to hoist him to(68,8)ch(105,10) be(1683,8)one wh(642,8)d the rope at last; and
afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the
royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad(334,10)sea for miles and miles,—ahead,
astern, this side, and that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded
at so great a height.

When in working(1038,10)hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold(1832,8)ilor at sea is
hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by(445,9); under these
circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict
charge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such
a wilderness of running(299,12)ose various different relations
aloft cannot(175,8)be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at
the deck; and when (19,8)-(1371,11)se ropes are being every few
minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural
fatality, if, unprovided(1583,8)constant watchman, the (534,8)sailor
should by some careless(356,8)the crew be cast adrift and fall all
swooping(1666,8)sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not
unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that(1283,9),
almost(1180,9)only(621,11)d ever ventured to oppose him with
anything(1330,8)slightest degree approaching to decision—one of those
too(655,8)faithfulness on the look-out he had(211,11)doubt
somewhat;—it was(269,8), that this was the very man he should select
for his(512,9); freely giv(1777,8)whole life into such an otherwise
distrusted person’s hands.

Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere(239,8)been there ten(778,8); (323,12) red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
incommodiously close(1598,10) manned mast-heads of whaleme(1822,8)se
latitud(141,13)ese birds came wheeling and scream(1705,10)his
head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a
thousand feet straight up(2042,8)e air; then spiralized downwards, and
went eddying again(164,10) head.

But(1699,10)gaze fixe(1870,11)dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed
not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked
it much, it being no uncommon (1672,12); only now(1861,8)the least
heedful eye(1067,11)see some sort of cunning meaning in(1936,8)every
sight.

“Your hat, y(10,9)sir!” suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who
being posted at the mizen-(655,9), stood directly behind Ahab, though(1046,9) lower than his level, an(1531,9)deep gulf of air dividing
them.

But already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes; the long
hooked bill at(598,9):(1663,8)scream, the black hawk(743,9)way with
his prize.

An eagle flew thric(965,8)Tarquin’s head, remo(1222,9)cap to replace
it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that(96,8)(1901,9)
king of Rome. But only by the replacing(1829,9)ap was that omen
accounted good.(1806,8)hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on
and on with it; far in advanc(1185,8) prow: and at last disappeared;
while from the point of tha(42,11)ance, a minut(436,8)spot was
dimly discerned, falling(87,8)at vast height(1195,10)sea.


CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.

The intens(39,9)sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
misnamed t(164,10), was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were
(1365,11)her broad beams, called shears, which, in some
whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck(1108,8)height of eight or nine
feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.

U(1550,8)stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you
now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see(42,11)e peeled,
half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.

“Hast seen the White Whale?”

“Look!” repl(1550,8)hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail;(1468,9)
his trumpet (939,8)ed to the wreck(139,9)killed him?”

“The harpoon is not yet forg(1253,8)ever will do that,” answered the
other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose
gathered sides some noiseless sailo(566,9)usy in sewing together.

“No(183,8)!” and snatching Perth’s levelled iron(1243,10)crotch, Ahab
held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold
his death! Tempered in blood, and t(23,8)by lightning are these
barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the
fin, where(641,16) most feels his accursed life!”

“Then God keep thee,(2011,8)—see’st thou that”—pointing to the
hammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only _that_ one I bury; the rest
were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning
to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then(746,8)rail, and
lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the(826,9)with
uplifted hands—“may(238,8)urrection and the life——”

“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like(649,11)to his men.

But the suddenly started(1938,8)was not quick enough to escape the
sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not
so quick, indeed, but that some(98,8)flying bubbles might have
sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.

As Ahab now glided(1083,10)dejected(2021,10)(1779,11) life-buoy
hanging(1909,8)Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.

“Ha! yonder! look yonder, men(452,9)a foreboding voice in her wake.
“In vain, oh, y(1945,10)s, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your
(1663,8) to show(25,8) coffin!”


CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.

It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were
hardly separable(1280,9)all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was
transparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look,(856,9)robust and
man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s
chest in his sleep.

Hither(117,8)ither, on high,(649,8)the snow-white wings of small,
unspeckled birds; these w(1551,8)gentle thoughts(829,9)eminine air;
but to and fro i(1986,8)eps, far down(23,8)bottomless blue, rushed
mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks;(1215,8)(168,12)strong,
troubled, murderous think(249,8)the masculine sea(1213,9)ough thus contrasting within, the(24,9) was only in shades and
shadows without; those two seemed one; i(65,11)the sex, as it were,
that distinguished them.

Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun(114,8)giving this gentle
air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the
girdling lin(1364,9)horizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most seen
here(1266,8)equator—denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.

Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knott(939,8)wrinkles; haggardly firm
and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the
ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth(858,8)clearnes(911,8)
morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s
forehead of heaven.

Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency(1967,8)azure! Invisible winged
creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood(1491,13)ky! how
oblivious were ye of old Ahab’s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen
little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
their old sire; spor(1068,9) the circle of singed locks which grew on
the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.

Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side
and watched how his shad(658,9) water sank and sank to his gaze,(627,8)e(1776,9)more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the
lovely aromas(1957,9)enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a
moment, the cank(1524,10)g(1842,9)oul. That glad, happy air, that
winsome sky,(115,14)troke and caress him; the step-mother world,
so long cruel—forbidding—now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn
neck, and did(247,9)joyously sob over him, as if over one, that
however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save
and to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into
the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee
drop.

Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily(771,21);
and he(1941,8)to hear(558,8)own true(269,8)he measureless sobbing
that stole out(1794,8)centr(1808,9)serenity around. Careful not to
touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood
there.

Ahab turned.

“(299,8)!”

“Sir.”

“Oh, (25,9) it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such
a day—very much such a sweetness as this—I struck my first whale—a
boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty—forty—forty years ago!—ago! Forty
years of continual whaling! (56,12)of privation, and peril, and
storm-time(53,15)n the pitiless sea! for(90,13)has Ahab
forsaken the peaceful land,(53,17)to make war(102,8)horrors
of the deep! Aye and yes(438,10),(621,10)ose(231,13)I have not
spent three ashore. When I think of this life(57,8)led; the
desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a
Captain’s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any
sympathy(1753,10)green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness!
Guinea-coast slavery(206,9)ary command!—w(280,15)all this;
only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before—and how(556,10)
(415,13)fed upon dry salted fare—fit emblem(1100,8)dry nourishment
of my soil!—wh(621,8)oorest landsman has had fresh fruit(1982,8)daily
ha(996,8)bro(692,8)world’s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts—away,
whole oceans away,(426,8)at young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and
sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage
pillow—wife? wife?—rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I
widowed that poor girl when I married her(1341,10); and then, the
madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood(53,8) smoking brow, with
which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly
chased his prey—more a demon than a man!—aye, aye! what a(1325,12)’
fool—fool—old fool, ha(129,11)been! Why this strif(1778,9)chase?
why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar,(274,9)ir(1436,8)the lance?
how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. (1757,15)s it not
hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been
snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me,
that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some
ashes! But do I look very old, so very,(19,11)(2036,8)? I feel
deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering
beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!—crack my
heart!—stave my brain!—mockery! (9,9)bitter, biting(24,8) of grey
hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus
intolerably old? Close! stand close to me(1028,12)let me look into a
human eye; it is(690,8)than to gaze into sea or sky;(37,15)
gaze upon God. By(1795,11)land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is
the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;
stay on board,(10,9)!—lower not(1322,8)do; when branded Ahab gives
chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thin(130,9)! not with
the far away home I see in that eye!”

“Oh, my Captain!(12,12) noble soul! grand old heart, after all!
why(1029,8)any one give (201,9)that hated fish! Away with me! let us
fly these deadly waters(32,8) home! W(396,8)child, too, are
(1648,8)’s—(432,9)child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow
youth; even as thine, sir, are the(522,10)(90,9)thy loving,
longing, paternal old age! Away(202,9)away!—this instant(800,8)alter
the course! How cheerily, how hila(1748,9)O(446,11), would we bowl
on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some
such mild blue days,(290,12)s, in(84,10).”

“T(67,8)(78,11). I have seen them—some summer days in the
morning. About this time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy
vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back
to dance him again.”

“’Tis my Mary,(9,8) herself! She promised that my boy, every(288,8),(1913,8)be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of
his father’s sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for
(580,9)! Come(1091,12), study out (712,10), and(767,13)
See, see! the boy’s face from the window(32,12)hand on(229,9)!”

But Ahab’s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
cast his last, cindered apple(346,8)soil.

“What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep
pushing(110,8)owd(14,9)jamming myself on all the time; recklessly
making me ready to do what in my own proper,(155,9)heart, I durst not
so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this
arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy
in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible
power; how then can this one small heart beat;(27,16)brain
think thoughts; unless God does that beating,(19,11)think(20,9)
that liv(492,9)not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round
in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all
(581,8), lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon
Albicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where
do murderers go, man! Who’s to doom, when the judge(574,8) is dragged
to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and
the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow;(1979,10)
been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck,(139,9)mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we
how we may, we all sleep at last(1490,8)field. Sleep? Aye, and rust
amid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down(1650,8)ft in the
half-cut swaths—(236,8)(1605,8)blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.

Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over(1727,8)other side; but started at
two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly
leaning ov(499,8)ame rail.


CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First Day.

That night,(123,8)mid-watch(784,11)old man—as his wont at
intervals—stepped forth(2016,10)scuttle in which he leaned, and went
to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
up the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some
barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that
peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living
sperm whale, was palpable to(1956,9)watch; nor was any mariner
surprised when, after inspecting the comp(1487,9)t(1277,8)dog-vane,
(23,9)ascertain(58,8)precise bearing(1124,8)odor as nearly as
possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the(412,8)course to be slightly
alter(559,8)the sail(37,8)hortened.

The acute policy dicta(234,8)se movements was sufficiently vindicated
at daybreak,(402,8)sight of a long sleek(1234,8)sea directly and
lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling(1009,8)pleated watery
wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift
tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.

“Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”

Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes(1540,9)orecastle
deck, Daggoo rou(1363,8)sleepers with such judgment claps that they
seemed to exhale(1149,17), so instantaneously did they appear
(199,8)ir cloth(1418,9)ir hands.

“What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening(1190,10)to the sky.

“Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.

“T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”

All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
swaying him(219,8)main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were
hoist(73,9)hither, when, while but two thirds(1117,8)way(226,11)
while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the
main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the
air. “There she blows!—t(17,15) A hump like a snow-hill! It is
Moby Dick!”

Fired(1550,8)cry which seemed simul(712,10)taken up(1598,8)three
look-outs, the men on deck rushed(667,8)rigging to behold the famous
whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final
perch, some feet above the other (171,11)Tashtego standing just
beneath him(1397,8)cap(1650,8)(437,12)mast, so(1054,9) Indian’s
head was almost on a level with Ahab’s heel. From this height the whale
was now seen some mile or so(1520,8)at every roll(1818,8)sea revealing
his high sparkling hump(1565,8)gularly jett(1106,8)silent spout into
the air. To the credulous mariners it(568,8)the same(72,14)they
(477,12)ago beheld(1689,8)moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

“And did none of ye see it befor(1326,16)(1255,8)the perched men
all around him.

“I saw him(442,8)that same(1492,8), sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I
cried out,” said(620,9).

“Not(287,10)instant; n(22,11)—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
(1319,9)(36,13)for me. _I_ only;(286,12)could hav(1123,8)
the White Whale first. (1117,33)(1134,10)
blows! There again(1164,8)again!” he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,
methodic tones, attun(1076,10)gradual prolonging(1442,10)hale’s
visible jets. “He’s going to sound! In (1731,11)Down
(1409,16)s! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay
on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;
steady, man, steady(340,8)go flukes! No, no; only black water! All
ready the boats there?(207,9), stand by! Lower me,(215,13);
lower, lower,—quick, quicker!” and he sli(1783,14)air(1950,8)deck.

“He is heading straight to leeward, sir,(931,8)Stubb, “right away from
us; cannot have seen(347,9) yet.”

“Be dumb, man(448,13)e braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up!
Shiver her!—s(12,11)So; well that! Boats, boats!”

Soon all(373,11)but(551,9)’s were dropped;(43,13)-sails
set—(66,8)paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to
leeward; and Ahab(373,9)the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up
Fedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.

Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows spe(573,14)sea;
but only slowly they neared the foe. As(24,13)him, the ocean grew
still more smooth;(1677,8)drawing a carpet over its waves(40,9)a
noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter
came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling
hump was distinctly visible, sliding along(2033,9)as if an isolated
thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,
greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkle(1437,9)slightly
projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged
waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky
forehead, a musical(863,10)playfully accompany(837,8)shade; and
behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving
valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and
danced by his side. But these were broken again(1297,8)light toes of
hundreds of gay fowl softly feather(262,9)ea, alternate with their
fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull
of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected
(92,9)white whale’s back; and at intervals one(685,8)cloud of
soft-toed fowls hover(836,9)to and fro skimming like a canopy over
the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail
feathers strea(104,10)pennons.

A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in(1606,12)invested
the gliding whale. Not(324,11)bull Jupiter swimming away with
ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering
eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,
(1838,10)traight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that
great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so
divinely swam.

On each soft side—coincident(846,9) parted swell, that but once
leaving(1785,9)n(1127,8)so wide away—on each(1081,8)side, the whale
shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some am(1632,8)hunters who
namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured
to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
tornadoes. Yet calm,(223,9) calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all
who(558,9)first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way
thou may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.

And thus, through the serene tranquilliti(1879,10)tropical sea, among
waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby
Dick moved on, still withhold(1465,9)sight the full terrors of his
submerged trunk, entirely hid(1875,8)wrenched hideous(1193,8)his jaw.
But soon the fore part of him slowly rose(1612,10)water; for an
instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s
Natural Bridge, and warningly w(912,8)s bannered flukes in the air,
the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.
Hoveringly halt(1674,9)dipping on the wing(1002,8)ite sea-fowls
longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.

With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheet(670,8)ir sails adrift,
the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.

“An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed
beyond(1299,10)’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
whirling roun(191,9)head(1611,8)wept(737,10)y circle. The breeze
now freshened; the sea began to swell.

“The birds!—t(11,9)” cried Tashtego.

In long Indian file, as when herons tak(629,18)birds were now
all flying(349,9)Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began
fluttering(692,10)wat(1708,8), whee(321,11)and round, with joyous,
expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could
discover no sign(994,8)sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down
into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigg(157,8)a
white weasel, with wonderful celerity upris(1070,9)magnifying as it
rose, till it turn(1156,8)then there were plainly(1211,10)two long
crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up(1458,9)
un(342,8)able bottom(837,9)(1035,12)open mouth and scrolled jaw;
his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue(1872,8)sea.
The gli(621,8)mouth yawned benea(57,8)oat like an open-doored marble
tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled
the craft asid(1768,9)is tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon
Fedallah to change places(130,8)m, went forward to the bows, and
seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and
stand by to stern.

Now, by reason of this timely spinn(1301,10)(375,9)upon its axis,
its bow, by anticipation, was made to face(1518,13)head while yet
under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem,(1701,10),(592,8)at
malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted
himself, as it were, in(1607,11), shooting his pleated head
lengthwise(685,17).

Through and through;(9,8) every plank and each rib, it thrilled for
(139,12)(1855,9) obliquely lying on his back,(1318,8)manner of a
biting shark, slowly and fe(281,9)aking its bows full(1571,8)his
mouth, so that the long, narrow,(1057,10)lower jaw curled high up into
the open air, and on(1046,9)teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish
pearl-whit(1104,9)insid(1118,9)jaw was(1763,8)six inches of Ahab’s
head, and reached high(1678,8)that. In this attitude the White Whale
now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With
unastonished eyes (1089,9)gaz(1566,8)crossed his arms; but the
tiger-yellow crew were tumbl(1985,9)each other’s heads to gain the
uttermost(1067,9)And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
whale dallied(1544,10)doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
body being submerg(1568,19), he could not be darted at from
(1381,10)for(1395,9) were almost(581,11)him(1046,12); and while
the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis
impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with
this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and
helpless(1076,8)very jaws he hated; frenz(448,9)all this, he seized
(1036,8) bone(1897,10)naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from
its gripe. As now he thus vain(58,9),(995,9)slippe(554,9)m; the
frail(679,10)bent in, collaps(852,8)snapp(427,8)oth jaws, like an
enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in
twain, and locked themselves fast again(1456,8)sea, midway between the
two floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the
crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the(992,9), and striving to hold
fast(43,8)oars to lash them across.

At that preluding moment, ere(1832,9) was yet(397,10)Ahab, the first
to perceive(1792,10)’s intent, by(384,10)y upraising(773,8)head, a
movement that loo(1358,8)hold(1041,9)time; at(896,8)ment his hand had
made one final effort to pus(2047,10) out(1747,8)bite. But only
slipp(583,12)into(218,13)mouth, and tilt(1477,9)sideways as
it(764,8),(332,10)had shaken off(222,10)on(1812,8); spilled him
out of it, as he leaned(520,8)push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the
sea.

Ripplingly withdrawing(1477,9) prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and dow(843,8)
billows; and(755,9)ame time slowly revolv(88,8)whole spindled body;
so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet(360,8)the water—the now rising swells,(1376,12)eir confluent waves,
dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray
still hig(638,13)air.* So, in a gal(1105,8)ut half baffled Channel(357,8) only recoil from the base(770,8)Eddystone, triumphantly to
overleap its summit with(186,8)cud.

*This motion is peculiar(1202,8)sperm whale. It receives its
designation (pitchpoling) from its being like(767,9)at preliminary
up-and-down poi(220,10)whale-lance,(1861,8)exercise called
(117,11), previously described. By t(228,11)(1257,9) must best
and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.

But soon resum(854,8)horizontal attitude(940,12)swam swiftly round
and round the wrecked crew;(1194,10)churning(764,10) in his vengeful
wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly
assault. The sigh(1401,9)splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the
blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants(1146,9)ook of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered(2045,8)foam of the
(1763,10)solent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he
could still keep afloat, eve(1319,8) heart of such a whirlpool as that;
helpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least
chance shock might burst. F(1071,9)oat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah
incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew,(1531,8)other
drifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to
look to themselves. For so(1619,10)ly appalling was the White Whale’s
aspect,(1889,8)planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,
that he(734,8)(969,10)ly swooping(1963,9)m. And though(283,11)boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into
the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal(345,8) instant
destruction(1844,8)jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that
case could they(425,11) hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,
they remained on the outer edg(1757,9)direful zone, whose centre had
now become the old man’s head.

Meantime,(1851,11)eginning all this had been descried(1897,10)ship’s
mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down(537,9) scene;
and was now so nigh, that Ahab(1761,8)water hailed her!—“Sail on
the”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from(1643,10), and
whelmed him(546,9)time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing
to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,(191,9)(2003,10)!—Drive him
off!”

The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and(233,10)up the charmed circle,
she effectually parted the whit(2039,8)from his victim. As he sullenly
swam off,(1342,9)s flew to the rescue.

Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded(773,10) white
brine caking(1983,8)wrinkles; the long tension of(1580,8)bodily
strength did crack, and (1627,8)ly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a
time, ly(794,8)crush(1858,10)bottom of(231,13), like one trodden
under foot of herds of(1995,10). Far inland, nameless wails came from
him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.

But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
abbreviate it. In an(1338,8)’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense
to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
through feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts,(1663,8)summary
in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time
aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of(1651,8)aneous
(411,8)ies; for even(103,10)pointless centres, those noble natures
contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.

“The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on
one bended arm—“is it safe?”

“Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it(131,8)Stubb, showing it.

“Lay it before me;—any missing men?”

“One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir(1048,8)re are
five men.”

“That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!
there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me!
The eternal sap runs up in(1277,10)nes again! Set the sail; out oars;
the helm!”

It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked
up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and(1708,8)se is
thus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.
But the added power of(1715,9) did not equal(42,23)
whale, for he seemed to have tre(135,11)his every fin; swimming with
a velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these
circumstances, pushed on,(310,11)would prove an indefinitely
prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long
a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing
barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,
then, as it(1635,11)happens, offered the most promising intermediate
means of overtaking(652,10). Accordingly,(568,9)s now made for her,
and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts(653,8)wrecked
boat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything
to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways
outstretching it with stun-sails, like the(899,8)jointed wings of an
albatross; the Pequod bore dow(1751,8)(1278,9)wake of Moby-Dick. At
the well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glitter(1337,9) was
regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when h(852,8)be
reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time,(1239,8)n pacing
the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the las(1322,9)of the
allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is(430,10)oon now?
D’ye(1693,8)?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded
them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now
aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pac(927,8)planks.

As he(1527,10)walking, u(523,8)no sound, except to hail the men
aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher(42,8)spread one to a
still greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,
at every turn he passed his own(1068,8) boat, which had been dropped
upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered
stern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded
sky fresh troops of clouds will(1470,11)sail across, so over the old
man’s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.

Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
evince(390,9)unabated fortitu(1385,8)thus keep up a valiant place in
his Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eye(1671,8)wreck exclaimed—“The
thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”

“What soulless thing is this that laughs(496,8)a wreck? Man, man! did
I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could
swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be hear(653,9)a
wreck.”

“Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen,
and an ill one.”

“Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to
man, they will honorably(43,15); not shake their heads, and
give an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles
of one thing;(294,10)is Stubb(1059,9), and Stubb is(335,9); and ye
(99,8)all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions(1756,8)peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How
now? Aloft there! (1774,13) Sing out for every spout(1008,8) he
spout ten times a second!”

T(1738,8)as nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.
Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.

“Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from the air.

“How heading when last seen?”

“A(1027,8), sir,—straight to leeward.”

“Good! he will travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and
top-gallant stun-sails, Mr.(960,9). We must not run over him before
morning; he’s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm
there! keep her full(1778,8)the wind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr. Stubb, send
a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till(198,8).”—Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast—“Men,
t(640,8) is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till
the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,
upon the day he shall be killed, (173,13)that man’s; and if on
that day(177,9)again raise him, then,(950,11)its sum(110,9)
divided among all of ye! Away now!—the deck is thine, sir!”

And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
slouching his hat, stood t(367,9) dawn, except when at intervals
rousing(116,9)to see how the night wore on.


CHAPTER 134. The Chase—Second Day.

At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually(685,8)afresh.

“(1379,13)” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light
to spread.

“See nothing, sir.”

“Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought
for;—the (1137,13)ails!—aye, they should have been kept on her all
night. But no matter—’tis but resting(223,9)rush.”

Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular
whale, continued through day into night, an(28,10)night into day, is
a thing by no means unprecedented(1111,8)South sea fishery. For such is
the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible
confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket
commanders; that(1760,10)simple observation of a whale(1771,10)
descried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty
accurately foretell both the direction in which(1827,9)(455,8) to
swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of
progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a
pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he
well knows, and(247,10)desires shortly to return to again, but at
some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes
the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more
certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be
visited: so does the fisherman, at(198,14)with the whale; for
after being chased, and diligently marked,(1053,9)several hours of
daylight(1845,8)when night obscur(155,11), the creature’s future
wake(1151,9)the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious
mind(397,8)hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that to this
hunter’s wondrous(1159,8)the proverbial evanesc(1175,8)(1282,8)writ in
water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the
steadfast land. And(210,8)mighty iron Leviathan(651,8)modern railway
is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their
hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly
say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such (1579,8)a
spot, at(24,15)n hour; even so, almost, there are occasions
whe(1212,8)(1534,9)ers time that other(350,18)deep,
according(649,8)observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so
many hours hence this(1620,8)ill have gone two hundred miles,(34,10)
about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to
render this acuteness at all successful(1998,8)end, the wind and the
sea must be(1133,10)man’s allies; for of wh(1326,11)avail to the
becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is
exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable
(2041,8)se statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the
chase of whales.

The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow(361,8)sea as when a
cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
field.

“By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but this swift motio(778,11)ck
creeps up one’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two
brave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,
o(307,9),—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel. (105,8)we go the gait
that leaves no dust behind!”

“There she blows—(10,9)!(11,11)—right ahead!” was now the
mast-head cry.

“Aye, aye(385,17)I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on and split
your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your
trump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller
shuts his watergate up(409,8)tream!”

And Stubb did but speak out for(1818,12)(1000,8)crew. The frenzies
of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine
worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the
growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken(780,9)on all sides routed,
as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand
of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the
previous day; the rack(1877,8)past night’s suspense; the fixed,
unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
towards its flying mark; by(214,8)se things, their hearts were bowled
along. T(1791,8)that made great bellie(253,8)ir sails, and rushed the
vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of
that unseen agency which so enslav(774,8)to(379,8)e.

T(594,9)one man, not thirty. For as the on(1715,8)hat held them all;
though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,
and pine wood; iron, and pitch,(1699,9)—yet(426,11)ran into each
other(1848,8)one concrete hull,(278,8)hot on its way, both balanced
and directe(725,9)long central keel; even so,(781,8) individualit(1180,12)rew, this man’s valor,(563,8)n’s fear; guilt and guiltiness,
all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all(191,10)to that
fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.

The rigging lived. The (1733,9)s, like the tops of tall palms, were
outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,
shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking
yards;(509,9)spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for
their fate. Ah! how they still strove(1565,11)at infinite blueness to
seek out the thing that might destroy them!

“Why sing ye not(1906,9)him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after
the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.
“Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd
jet that way, and then disappears.”

It was(950,8); in(1502,10)dlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
other thing for the whale-spout,(1329,8)event itself soon proved; for
hardly had Ahab(716,9)his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its
pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra(1148,9)de the
air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant
halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer(1685,8)ship
than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—(544,9)
bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not
by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the
White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but(1642,8)far more wondrous
phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity(1239,9)
furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the
pure element of air(1953,8)ling up a m(268,8)of dazzling foam, shows
his place(502,8)distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,
the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,
this(334,10) is his act of defiance.

“There she breaches! t(20,18)”(940,9)cry, as in his
immeasurable bravadoes the (541,12)tossed himself salmon-like to
Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain(820,8)sea, and relieved
against the still bluer marg(56,11)ky, the spray that he raised,
(1269,8)moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
stood there gradually fading and(11,9)way from its first sparkling
intensity,(589,10)m mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.

“Aye, breach your last(1170,9)un,(1654,10)!(1806,14)“thy hour
and thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the
fore. The boats!—stand by!”

Unmindful(1298,8)tedious rope-ladders(506,9)hroud(1735,10), like
shooting stars, slid(902,9)eck,(1155,8)isolated backstays and
halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapi(1731,8)dropped
from(1766,10).

“Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had(1828,13)boat—a spare one,
rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck,(1647,9) is thine—keep
(623,10)t(391,8), but keep near them. Lower, all!”

As if to strike a quick terror(1346,9)m, by this time being the first
assailant(1028,8)(636,11) had turned, and was now coming for the
three crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told
them he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up
to his forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
such a course excludes the(252,8)onset(439,10)whale’s sidelong
vision. But ere that close limit was gai(348,10)hile yet all three
boats wer(1382,8)as(582,9)’s three masts to his eye;(1509,16)
churning(1511,9)into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,
rushing among(684,10) with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered
appalling battle on every side; and heedles(1113,9)irons darted at him
from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank
of which thos(209,9)ere made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly
wheeling like trained chargers(1836,8)field;(312,11)for a while
eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth(1300,8)all the
time,(897,8)unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.

But at last in his untraceable evolutions,(618,16) so crossed
and recross(1087,8)in a thousand ways entangled the slack(1645,9)hree
lines now fast to him, that they foreshorte(1191,8), of themselves,
warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in(397,12) now
for a moment(1180,11)drew aside a little, a(1437,8)rally (59,8)re
tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more
line: and then was(1785,9)hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping
that way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage
than the embattled teeth of sharks!

Caught and twisted—corkscrewed(806,8)maze(1018,9)line, loose harpoons
and lances, with(766,8)ir bristling barbs and points, came flashing
and dripping up to the chock(946,9)bows of(1746,12). Only one
thing could be don(459,13)e boat-knife, he critically reached
within—through—(463,8), without—the rays of steel; dragg(304,10)line
beyond, passed it, inboard,(218,8)bowsman,(564,9), twice sundering
the rope near(271,11)—drop(832,8)intercepted fagot(155,9) into
the sea; and was all fast again. That(1631,8)(1088,18)made a
sudden rush(1647,11)remaining tangl(552,10)other lines; by so
doing, irresistibly(315,9)the more involv(1038,9)of Stubb and Flask
(1057,8)his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a
surf-beaten beach(390,12)diving down into the sea, disappeared in a
boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of
the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly
stirred bowl of punch.

While the two crews were yet circling(1811,8)waters, reaching out after
the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while
aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching
his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws(1262,10); and Stubb was
lustily sing(231,8)for some one to ladle him up; and w(331,9)old
man’s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling(587,10)creamy pool to
rescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of(1975,11)
concreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up(1905,8)
Heaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
from(814,10)(1098,16)dashed his broad forehead against its
bottom, and sent it, turning over and over,(926,10)air; till it fell
again—gunwale downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under
it, like seals from a sea-side cave.

The first uprising momentum(1848,8)whale—modifying its direction as he
struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along it, to a little
distance (395,9)centre(1984,8)destruction he had made; and with his
back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling(60,9) flukes from
side to si(99,9)henever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or
crumb(1627,8)boats touc(590,8)skin, his tail(1297,8) drew back, and
came sideways smiting(1500,8). But soon, as if satisfied that his work
for that time was done, he pu(737,9)pleate(739,11)through the
oce(2040,9)railing after him(2004,10)tangled lines, continued his
leeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.

As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
came bear(1821,9)to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
(1563,9)mariners, (1604,16)whatever else could be caught at,
and safely land(2041,8)on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,
and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;
inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these
were there; but no fatal or even serious ill(1464,8)to have befallen
any one. As with Fedallah the day(507,9)so Ahab was now found grimly
clinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy
float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s mishap.

But when he was helped(619,8)deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the(557,9) of
Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory
leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.

“Aye, aye, (146,10)’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be(1353,8)ner who he
will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”

“The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I
put good work(1986,8)at leg.”

“But no bone(639,8), sir, I hope(105,8)Stubb with true concern.

“Aye! and all(326,9)ed to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a
broken bone,(298,10)is untouched; and I account no living bone of
mine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale,
nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze(167,11)n his own proper and
inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
yonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”

“Dead to leeward, sir.”

“Up helm, then; pile (892,8)ail again, ship keepers! down(1647,8)t of
the spare boats and rig them—Mr.(810,9) away, and muster the boat’s
crews.”

“Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks(203,10)Oh, oh, oh! how this(953,9) gores me now! Accursed fate! that the
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”

“Sir?”

“My body,(559,8)t thee. Give me something for a cane—there, that
shivered lance will do. M(315,10)men. Surely I have not seen him yet.
By heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”

The old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
Parsee was(262,8)re.

“The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must(1888,8)en caught in——(1282,8)black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
forecastle—find him—not gone(9,9)!”

But quickly they returned to him with the tidings(588,9) (246,10)
nowhere to be found(1610,9)(1457,11)Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I(393,8)
I saw him dragging under.”

“_My_ line! _my_ line? Gone?—gone? What means that little word?—What
death-knell rings in it, that(1721,10)shakes as if he were the belfry.
The harpoon, too!—toss over the litter there,(1553,12)?—the forged
iron, men, the(1437,12)’s—no, no, no,—blistered fool! this hand did
dart it!—’tis(995,8)fish!(1353,14)Keep him nailed—Quick!—all
hands to the rigging of(1236,9)s—collect the oars—harpooneers! the
irons, the irons!—hoist the royals higher—a pull on all the
sheets!—helm(1528,8)steady, steady for(564,8)fe! I’ll ten times girdle
the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but I’ll slay
him yet!”

“Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,(1026,10)arbuck;
“never, never wilt thou capture him,(1183,8)—In Jesus’ name no more of
this,(2005,8)worse than devil’s madness. Two days chased; twice stove
to(1612,9)s; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
shadow gone—all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:—what more
wouldst thou have?—Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he
swamps the last man? (71,9)be dragged by him(741,8)bottom of the
sea(53,14)tow(51,17)infernal world? Oh, oh,—Impiety
and blasphemy to hunt him more!”

“(531,8), of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that
hour we both saw—thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes. But in this
matter(998,8)whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
hand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This
whole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates’ lieutenant; I act
under orders. Look thou, underling!(1822,8)ou obeyest mine.—Stand round
me, men. Ye see an(998,8) cut down(1397,8)stump; leaning on a shivered
lance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but
Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel
strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a
gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and till
ye hear _that_, know that Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe
ye, men,(1843,8)things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!
For ere they drown, drowning(84,8)will twice rise(501,9)urface;
then rise again, to sink(819,9)more. So with Moby Dick—t(1514,8)he’s
floated—tomorrow will(980,8)third. A(247,9)he’ll rise(1529,10),—but
only to spout his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”

“As fearless fire(1802,11)ubb.

“And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then(1128,8)men went forward, he
(48,9)on: “T(441,22)! And yesterday I talked the same
to(1953,9) there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek
to drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The
Parsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but still was
to be seen again ere I could perish—How’s that?—There’s a riddle now
might baffle all the lawyers back(1407,9) ghosts(1600,10)ole line of
judges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks my brain. _I’ll_, _I’ll_ solve it,
though!”

When dusk descended,(1720,10) was still in sight to leeward.

So(739,10) the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on
the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
grindstone was heard till(106,8)daylight,(774,12)toiled by
lanterns(1206,8)complete and careful rigging(2013,8)spare boats and
sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime,(493,8)broken
keel of(1397,8)wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while
still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his
scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its
dial; sat due eastward(273,9)earliest sun.


CHAPTER 135. The Chase.—Third Day.

The morn(399,11)third day dawned fair and fresh, and(688,14)
solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowd(934,8)
(604,8) look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.

“D’ye see him?(1505,8)Ahab; but(916,15)not yet(918,9).

“In his infallible wake, though; but foll(2003,8)(30,8)at’s all. Helm
there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day
again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-hou(1989,9)
angel(1004,9)is(494,9)the first of its throwing open to them, a
fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here’s foo(663,8)ought, had
Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;
_that’s_ tingling enough for mortal man!(103,9)’s audacity. God only
has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness
and a calmness; and our poor(1895,8)throb,(27,14)brains beat too
much for that. And yet, I’ve sometimes(337,8)(1695,9) was very
calm—frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the
contents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing
now;(622,8)ment(25,8), and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like
that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between(1293,8)thy
clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow
it; they whip it about me(1796,8)torn shreds of split sails lash the
tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this
through prison corridors and cel(1005,8)wards of hospitals, and
ventilated(993,8)nd now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.
Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind, I’d blow no more on such a
wicked, miserable(1097,8)I’d crawl somewhere to a cav(655,8)link
there(816,11)’tis a noble and heroic thing,(150,9)! who ever
conquered it? In every fight it has the l(1657,8)bitterest blow. Run
tilting at it, and you but run (437,8)it. Ha! a coward(500,10)
strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.
Even Ahab is a bra(1367,8)g—a nobl(15,8) than _that_. Would now the
wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and
outrage(1422,11),(60,8)s(62,9)are bodiless, but only(19,9) as
objects, not as agents. There’s a most special,(16,8)cunning, oh, a
most malicious difference!(1384,11) say again, and swear it now, that
there’s something all glorious and gracious in(770,9). These warm
Trade Winds, at least, that(52,8)clear heavens blow straight on, in
strong and steadfast, vigorous mild(1679,10)veer not from their mark,
however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest
Mississippie(58,9)land swift(335,8)rve about, uncertain (987,9)go
at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly
blow my good ship on; thes(52,8), or(453,11)like them—(473,10)so
unchangeable, and full as strong, (106,8)keeled soul along! To it!
Aloft there! What d’ye see?”

“Nothing, sir.(17,11)! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!
Aye, aye, i(1896,8)e so. I’ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye,
he’s chasing _me_ now; not I, _him_—that’s bad; I might have known it,
too. Fool! the lines—the harpoons he’s towing. (189,10)I have run him
by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look
outs! Man the braces!”

Steering as she had done(1588,10) had been somewhat on the Pequod’s
quarter, so that now being pointed(1049,8)reverse direction,(144,10)d
ship (422,8)ard upo(177,8)eeze(165,8)rechurned the cream in her own
white wake.

“Against(208,11)e now steers for the open jaw,” murmured Starbuck to
himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace(187,10)rail. “God
keep us, but already my bones feel damp within m(897,8)rom the inside
wet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!”

“Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
“We should meet him soon.”

“(913,10)sir,” and(1490,9)way(350,10)did Ahab’s bidding, and once
more Ahab swung on high.

A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the
weather bow, Ahab descried the spout(1898,12)instantly(1697,9)
three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had
voiced it.

“Forehead to f(12,8)I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck
there!—brace sharper up; crowd her into(2043,9)’s eye. He’s too far
off to lower yet, Mr.(867,9). The sails shake! Stand over that
helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But
let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there’s
time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and
not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy,(1032,10)sand-hills of
Nantucket! The same!—t(10,10)he same to Noah as to me. There’s a
soft shower to leeward. Such lovely(21,8)ings! They must lead
somewhere—to something else than common land, more palmy than the
palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then;
the better(804,8)bitterer quarter. But good bye,(10,10) old
(893,9)! What’s this?—green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks.
No such green (1052,8)stains on(1264,8)head!(392,9)the difference now
between man’s old age and matter’s. But aye, old mast, we both grow old
together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a
leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood has (398,11)of my live
flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and I’ve known some ships
made of dead trees outlast the lives of men (44,8)the most vital
stuff of vital fathers.(504,10)at he said? h(1769,9)still go before
me, my pilot;(1015,9)to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at
the bottom(171,8)sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and
all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye,
aye, like many more thou told’st direful truth as touching thyself, O
Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye,(1789,10)—keep
a good eye upon the whale,(1057,8)le I’m gone. We’ll talk to-morrow,
nay, to-night, whe(73,8)(1119,10)lies down there, tied by head and
tail.”

He gave the word; an(534,9)azing round him, was steadily lowered
through the cloven blue air to the deck.

In due time the boats were(77,8); but as standing in his shallop’s
stern, Ahab just hovered(339,10)point(803,8)descent, he waved to the
mate,—who held on(854,9)tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him pause.

“(2033,8)!”

“Sir?”

“For the third time my soul’s ship starts(517,8)is voyage, (80,8).”

“Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.”

“S(1092,9) sail(1877,9)ir ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
(195,13)Truth, sir: saddest truth(110,10)men die at ebb tide; some at low water(19,10)the full of the
flood;—and I feel now like a billow(1427,11) one crested comb(177,10). I am old;—shake hands with me, man.”

Their hands met; their eyes fastened;(378,9)’s tears the glue.

“Oh, my captain(12,12)!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see, it’s a
brave man that weeps; how great the agony(1500,8)persuasion then!”

“Lower away!”—cried(1166,8)ossing the mate’s arm(1318,9). “Stand by
the crew!”

In an instant(915,9) was pull(1022,10)close under the stern.

“The sharks! t(12,10)” cried a voice(664,9) low cabin-window
there; “O master, my(11,9)come back!”

But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
boat leaped on.

Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed(208,10)ship, when
numbers of sharks, seemingly ris(1719,9)out the dark waters beneath
the hull, maliciously snapped(847,8)blades(1882,8)oars, every time
they dipped in the(916,8)and in this way accompanied(510,11)ith
their bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening(1517,8)whale-boats
in those swarming seas;(555,11) at times apparently following them
in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of
marching regiments(282,8)east. But these were the first(165,8)that
had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale (54,9)first
descried; and whether it was that Ahab’s crew were all such
tiger-yellow barbarians,(731,8)refore their flesh more musky(1784,8)sens(573,10)sharks—a matter sometimes well known to affect
them,—howev(182,9), they seemed to fo(1477,9) on(598,11)out
molest(1196,8)others.

“Heart of wrought steel!” murmured(1820,9) gazing(488,10)side, and
(568,10)with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly
to that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening(1006,9)and followe(1386,8)m, open-mouthed(803,8)chase(1170,8)is the critical third day?—For
when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be
su(725,13)is the morning, the second the noon(596,9) third the
evening(26,9)end of that thing—be that end what it may. Oh! my God!
what is(250,8)at shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet
expectant,—fix(1309,10)top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,
as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.
Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see
but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem
clearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming? My legs
feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats
it yet? Stir thyself,(969,9)!—stave it off—move, move! speak
aloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft
there!—keep(965,8)nest eye upon(1788,9)s:—mark well(1740,10)!—Ho!
again!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he tears the vane”—pointing
to the red flag flying(2009,8)main-truck—“Ha! he soars away with
it!—Where’s the old man now? see’(1238,8)(1219,10), oh Ahab!—shudder,
(797,8)”

T(253,8) had not gone very far, when by a signal from the m(410,8)s—a
downward pointed arm, Ahab knew(1064,8)e w(1816,9)sounded; but
intending to be near him(985,8)next rising, he held on his way a
little sideways(168,10)vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the
profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and(13,9)
against the opposing bow.

“Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads
drive them in! ye but strike a th(1790,8)out a lid; and no coffin and
no hearse can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”

Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
quickly upheaved, as if(445,10)sliding from a submerged berg of ice,
swiftly rising(1888,8)surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a
subterraneous hum(1943,8)en all held their breaths; as bedraggled with
trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,
but obliquely(872,10)sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,
it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air(239,11)fell swamping
back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards,(527,12)flashed for
an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of
flakes, leaving the circling(495,8) creamed like new milk (667,9)
marble trunk of(1506,10).

“Give way!” cried Ahab(593,8)oarsmen,(540,8) boats darted forward to
the attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in
him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad
white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;
as head on, he came churn(110,8)tail among(1935,10); and once more
flailed them apart; spilling out the irons(883,11)(1711,10)two
mates’ boats, and dashing in one side(541,8)upper part of(1030,8)ows,
but(652,9)Ahab’s almost(1404,11)scar.

While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopp(723,8)strained planks; and as the
whale swimm(239,8)(1929,8)m, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
shot by them again; at that(1065,8)a quick cry went up. Lashed round
and(857,8)o the fish’s back; pinioned(1138,8)turns upon turns in
which, dur(976,8)past night,(923,10) had reeled the involutions of
the line(1667,9)him, the half torn body(1007,8)Parsee was seen; his
sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old
Ahab.

The(1532,8) dropped from his hand.

“Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye, Parsee! I see
thee again.—Aye(1185,8)ou goest before(1748,8)is, _this_ then is the
hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee(1894,8)last letter of
thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates,(1967,9)hip! those
boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;
if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the first thing that but
offers to jump(1933,8)is boat I stand in,(313,8)ing I(2038,8). Ye are
not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—Where’(1019,11)? gone down again?”

But he(1399,8)too nigh(1699,9); for as if bent upon escaping with the
corpse he bore,(1143,8)if the particular plac(1311,9)last encounter
had been but a stage in his leeward voyage(1758,12)was now again
steadily(1256,10)forward; and had(1384,8)passed(576,9),—which thus
far (142,9)sailing(1164,8)contrary direction to(1079,8)ough for the
present her headway(86,11)topped. He(1953,8)(1435,9)with his
utmost velocity, and now only int(403,9)pursu(1913,8)own straight
path(1352,8)sea.

“Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third
day, to desist. See!(406,11)seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that
madly seekest him!”

Setting sail(1567,8)rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled
to(565,8), by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding
by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish(332,9)’s face as he
leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn(112,11) about, and
follow him, (421,8)swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,
he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting(1960,8)three
mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rock(823,11)two staved boats
which had but just been hoisted(1500,9)ide, and were busily at work in
repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he
sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying
themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all
this; as he heard the hammers(1153,8)broken boats; far other(39,8)
seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking
that the vane or flag was gone(1742,8)e main-(527,9), he shouted to
(614,10)who had just gained that perch(1099,8)cend again for another
flag, and a hammer and nails,(1786,8)nail it(1074,8)mast.

Whether fagged by(710,10) days’ running chase, and the resistance to
his(1619,10)in the knotted hamper(1789,8); or whether it was some
latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White
Whale’s way now began to abate, as it seemed,(423,10)boat so rapidly
nearing him once more;(1730,8)indeed the whale’s last start had not
been so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glid(1284,12)waves
the unpitying sharks accompanied him;(484,8)pertinaciously stuck to
(227,8)(41,9)continually bit at the plying oars, (739,9)blades
became jagged and crunched, and left small splint(917,11)sea, at
almost every dip.

“Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull
on! ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”

“But a(158,8)bite, sir(2007,9)n blades grow smaller and(12,8)!”

“They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he
muttered—“(800,8)these(501,8)swim to feast on(640,10) or on
Ahab?—But(104,9) Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm! take the
helm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of(1748,13)helped him forward
to the bows(46,8)still(1595,8)boat.

At length as the craft was cast to on(1769,12)ran ranging along with
(1028,9) (1028,8)flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
advance—as(343,11)sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the
smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off(1563,10)(1083,8)spout, curled
round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
hated whale. As both steel and curse sank(1687,8)socket, as if sucked
into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his
nigh flank against(670,8), and, without staving a hole in it, so
suddenly canted(1592,10)over, that had it not been for the elevated
part(828,8)gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would(1668,10) have
been tossed(364,9) sea. As it was, three(936,15)—who foreknew
not the precise instan(160,9)dart, and were therefore unprepared for
its effects—these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an(114,9)two
of them clutched(292,13)again, and rising to its level on a
combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again;(1501,8)rd man
helplessly dropping astern, but(1971,8)float and swimming.

Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
instantaneous swiftness, (1241,15)(911,8)through the weltering
sea. But when Ahab cried out(868,9)teersman to take new turns(1355,10)line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their
seats, and tow(817,10)up(1007,8)mark; the moment the treacherous line
felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!

“What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis who(622,8); oars! oars!
Burst in upon him!”

Hearing(182,8)mendous rush(1779,9)ea-crash(1779,8),(1976,11)whee(1525,10)to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
catching sigh(1123,9)nearing black hull(1931,9)hip; seemingly seeing
in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a
larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing
prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

Ahab staggered; his hand smote his(334,9). “I grow blind; hands!
stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”

“T(2010,8)! The ship!” cri(816,9)inging(1426,8).

“O(616,10) Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for
ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time(715,8)s mark! I
see:(542,9)!(10,10) Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”

But as(1655,12) violently forced their boat(1225,12)
sledge-hammering seas, the(399,8)whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
burs(89,9), and(1648,15)almost, the temporarily disabled boat
lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,
trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.

Meantime, for that one beholding(1968,8), Tashtego’s mast-head hammer
remained suspended in(796,9); and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
bowsprit beneath, caught(1272,14)down-coming monster just as soon
as he.(944,12)(1432,11)! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet p(1151,8)
air, now hug me close! Let not(216,10)die, if die he must, in a
woman’s fainting fit.(133,10)I say—ye fools, the jaw!(9,9) Is
this the end(1462,8)my bursting prayers?(25,8)life-long fidelities?
Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up
helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on
towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me
now!”

“Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now
help Stubb; for(677,8)too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning
whale! Who ever helpe(755,9)or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb’s own
unwinking eye? And now po(150,8) goes to bed upon a mattrass that is
all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood!(219,16)
(219,13)(1786,8)Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins
of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would
yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but h(1271,8)cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh!(213,20), but there’ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye
not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; le(505,8)die in his
drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;—cherries!
(10,9) (10,10)Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!”

“Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh,(1477,8)I hope
my poor mother’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will
now come to her(1820,8)e voyage is up.”

From the ship’s bows,(1999,8)all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their
hands,(1666,9)they had darted from their various employments; all
their enchanted eyes intent(1821,9)(1737,8)which from side to side
strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of
overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,
swift vengeance, eternal malice wer(765,8) whole aspect, and spite of
(1021,8) mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead
smote(554,12)starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell
fla(394,10)ir faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the
harpooneers aloft shook (80,9)bull-like necks. Through the breach,
they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.

“The ship! The hearse!—the second(19,8)” cried Ahab(704,9) boat;
“its wood could only be American!”

Diving beneath the settling ship,(720,10) ran quivering along its
keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab’s boat, where, for a
time, he lay quiescent.

“I turn my body(301,10)sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy
hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel;
and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck(1245,8)ughty helm, and
Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and
without me? Am I cut off(577,10)last fond pride of meanest
shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on(16,8)life! Oh, now I feel
my topmost greatness lies in (29,13)ief. Ho, ho! from all your
furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone
life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll,
thou all-destroying but unconquering whale;(773,8)last I grapple with
thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last
breath(47,8). Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
and since neither can be mine,(800,8)then tow to pieces, while still
chasing thee, though tied to(21,11) damned whale! _Thus_, I give up
the spear!”

The(2038,8) was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
velocity the line ran t(1489,11)grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stooped to
clear it; he did (17,10)but the flying turn caught him round the
n(1007,9)voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was
shot out of(1543,9), ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the
heavy eye-splice in the rope’s final end flew(112,12)stark-empty
tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
depths.

For an(168,13) tranced boat’s crew stood still; then turned. “The
ship? Great God, where is the ship?” Soon they(522,9)dim, bewildering
mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as(318,8)gaseous Fata
Morgana; only the uppermost masts(455,8)water; while fixed by
infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the
pagan(837,8)eers still maintained their sinking lookouts on(436,8).
And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself,(1153,9)its
crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,
animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the
smallest chip(836,8)Pequod(854,8)sight.

But as(1835,10)whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
sunken head(944,8)Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yard(66,8) flag,
which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings,(203,9) (1779,10)
(1898,8)they almost touched;—at tha(1134,11)a red arm and a hammer
hovered backwardly uplifted(1164,8)open air,(1181,8)act of nailing the
flag faster and yet(15,8)to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that
tauntingly had followed(415,9)-truck downwards from its natural home
amo(1256,8)tars, pecking(490,8)flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;
this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between
the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial
thrill,(320,8)merged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his
hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic
shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upward(38,11)whole captive
form fold(597,10)flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like
Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of
heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.

Now small fowls flew sc(995,8)(925,9)yet yawning gulf; a sullen
white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed,(575,8)
great shrou(1225,9)sea rolled on as it(16,8)five thousand years ago.


Epilogue

“AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE” Job.

The drama’s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—Because one
did survive the wreck.

It so(881,8), that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he whom the
Fates ordained to take the place(635,8)’s bowsman, when that(19,8)
assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when(1963,8)last day the three
men were tossed from(1766,8)the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So,

subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting

wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gain(1461,8)
