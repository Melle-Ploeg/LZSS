CHAPTER 1. Loomings.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—(307,6)mind how long precisely—having
little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me
on(824,6), I thought I would sail about a (111,7)and se(452,6)watery part
(900,7)world. It is a way I have of driv(322,6)(945,7)pleen and
regulat(508,8)circulation. Whe(580,6)I find myself growing grim(166,6)
the mouth; w(53,8)i(139,7)damp, drizzly November(307,7)soul(52,10)
(105,14)involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
bringing up(677,6)ear of every funeral I meet; and especially(136,10)my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into(420,6)treet(213,6)methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to
get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I
quietly take (244,8)hip. There is(837,9)surpris(287,6) this. If they
but knew it, almost (997,6)n(45,6)eir degree, some(269,6)or other,
cherish very nearly(804,6)ame feelings towards the ocean with me.

(176,6)now is your insular city (929,7)Manhattoes, belted round by
wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it(137,6)her
surf. Right and left,(588,11)s(364,6)you waterward. Its extreme
downtown i(234,6)battery, where(751,6)noble mole is washed by wav(900,8)cool(21,6)breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of
land. Look at the crowds of(189,6)-gazers there.

Circumambulate(50,6)(382,7)a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go(909,6)Corlears
Hook to Coenties Slip, and(950,6)thence, by Whitehall, north(336,6)What
do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all a(520,6)the town, stand
thousands(829,6)(15,10)of morta(741,6)fixed in(663,7)reveries. Some
leaning agains(330,6)spiles;(782,6)seated(99,8)e pier-head(33,7)
looking over(533,6)ulwarks of ships(322,7)hina(85,7)high aloft(900,7)
rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these
are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to
counters, nailed to benches, clinch(21,6)desks. How the(787,7)is? Are
the green fields gone? What do they here?

But look! here come mor(721,8), pacing straight fo(360,6)water(849,6)seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them b(321,6)
(999,7)st limit of the land; loitering und(491,7)shady lee of yonder
warehouses(106,6)not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh(215,10)
as(293,6)possibly can without falling in. A(794,6)re(341,6)stand—miles of
them—leagues. Inlanders all,(390,6)come(995,6)lanes and alleys, streets
and avenues—north, east, south(1021,6)west. Yet(455,6)they all unite. Tell
me, does the magnetic virtue(365,8)need(189,6) the compass(17,6)all
those(856,7)attrac(453,7)thither?

Onc(579,6). Say you are(874,7) country; in(909,11)land of lakes. Take
almost any path you please(243,6)ten to one it carries you down in a
dal(46,7)leav(31,7)(432,6)by a pool(154,8)stream. There is magic in
it. Let(312,6)ost absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest
reveries—stand that man o(39,6)legs, set his feet a-going(476,6)he will
infallibly lead(204,6)o(905,8)if(915,6)(223,8)e in all(111,6)region.

Now(549,7)I say(544,6)I am(224,8)habit of going(692,7) whenever I begin
to grow hazy about the eyes(486,6)begin to be over conscious of my
lungs, I do no(483,6) to ha(573,6)inferre(707,7)I ever(838,10) as a

of such offices to those who like them(440,6)my part, I abominate all
honorable respectable toils, trial(622,7)tribulations of every kind
whatsoever(850,8)quite a(356,6) as I can do to take care(679,6)self,
without taking(31,9)ships, barques, brigs, schooner(778,7)what not.
And as for(862,7)as cook,—(432,9)confess there is conside(262,6)glory
in that, a cook being a sort of(371,7)r on ship-board—yet, somehow, I

True, they rather order me about some(892,6)make me jump from spar to

I mean,(591,8)scales of the New Testament? Do(249,6)hink the archangel
Gabriel(28,6)s any(787,6)the less of me, because I promptly and
respectfully obey(187,6)(280,10)in(205,6)(812,10) instance? Who ain’t
a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however th(376,6)(365,11)s may
order me about—(48,11)y may thump and punch(42,9), I(773,6)the
satisfa(593,9)know(751,6)at it is all right;(424,6)everybody else is
one way or other served in much(433,6)ame way—either in a physical or
meta(16,9)point of view,(544,7)s; and s(981,6)universal(233,7)is

Again, I always go to sea as(942,11)(562,8)(384,7)ke a(199,9)

penn(625,7)I ever heard of. O(858,6)contrary,(65,12)themselves must
pay. And there(483,8)the difference(872,8)world between (199,7)and
being paid. The act of(34,8)is perhaps the most uncomfortable
infli(631,6)that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being
paid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity(29,6)which a man
receives money is really marvellous, consider(798,9)we so earnestly
believe(69,7)to be the root of all earthly ills(674,6)that on no
account can a monied man ent(493,6)ven. Ah! how cheerfully we(159,6)gn

head winds are far more prevalent than(34,7)from astern (that is, if
you(813,7)violat(362,6)Pythagorean maxim), so for(646,10)part the
Commodore o(828,6)quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from

so. In much (83,6)me way do(984,7)mmonalty lead their leaders in many

doubtless, my going(635,6)is(244,8) (244,6), formed(685,6)(904,7)grand

Though I cannot tell why(780,8)exactly(845,8)ose stage managers, the

me to set about (725,7)ing the(889,6)I did, besides cajoling m(163,10)

curiosity. Then the wild (190,7)tant seas where he rolled his island

the attending marve(52,6)a thousand Patagonian sight(584,6)sounds,

CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.

I stuffed a shirt or two in(818,6)old c(50,6)bag, tucked it under my
arm(587,6)started for Cape Horn(288,6)he Pacific. Quitting the good city
of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night
in December. Much was I disappointed upon learn(137,6)at the little
packet for Nantucket had already sailed(833,6)that no way of reaching
that(741,7)(838,6)offer, ti(784,7)following Monday.

As(505,6)young candidates for the pains and penalti(732,6)(785,8)stop at
this same(307,12)(834,6)ce to embark on their(842,7), it may (849,6)l
be relate(231,7)I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was
made up to sail in no other than a(358,11)craft, because(853,7)was a
fine, boisterous something about every(17,6)connected with(966,6)famous
old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though(636,12) has
of late been gradually monopolis(737,8)busines(423,12)(568,8)ough
in this matter poor old(633,11)is now much behind her, yet(671,10)
was her great original—the Tyre of(104,6)Carthage;—the(672,8)here the
first dead American whal(388,6)stranded. Where else but from(140,11)did those ab(138,8)(71,6)men, the Red-Men, (114,6)sally out in canoes
to give chase to the Leviathan? And(186,7)(131,18), too, did(904,6)(216,6)adventurous(1003,7) sloop put forth, partly laden with
imported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the(312,6)s, in
order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon(351,6)the
bowsprit?

Now having a night, a day(606,6)still an(871,6)night following before me
in(730,12), ere I could embark f(976,6)destined port, it became a
(700,7)of concernment(598,7)I was to eat(154,6)leep meanwhile. It(993,7)very dubious-looking, nay, a (29,6)ark and dismal(248,8)bit(960,6)cold
and cheerless. I knew no one in (760,9). With anxious grapnels I had
sounded my po(596,6)and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,
wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood(164,8)middle of
a dreary street shouldering my bag(501,6)comparing the gloom towards the
north with the darkness(36,12) south—(186,9)in your wisdom you
may conclude to lodge for th(714,6)t,(561,6)ar(242,10)be sure to
inquire(393,6)rice(691,6)don’t be too particular.

With halting steps I paced(895,7)reets(761,6)pass(24,8)ign of “The
Crossed H(852,6)s”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further
on,(911,9) bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,”(72,6) came
such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melt(229,7)packed snow and
ice(137,6)(972,7)the house, for every(898,6)els(364,6)congealed frost lay
ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,
when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, becaus(198,6)
(114,6)remorseless servic(550,6)sol(862,6)my boots were(172,6)most
miserable plight. T(464,22),(151,6) th(962,6)I, pausing one
moment to watc(807,6)broad gla(114,6)(626,10)(885,6)hea(762,6)sounds of
the tinkling glasses within. But go on,(797,10)said I at last;(779,6)
you hear? get away(498,17)door;(930,6)patched(288,7)are
stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct follow(855,14)
that took me waterward(615,6)there, doubtless,(409,6)the cheapest, if not
(21,7)eriest inns.

Such dreary(968,8)! blocks of blackness, not(737,6)s, on either hand,
(392,6)r(952,6)(874,6)a candle, lik(15,10) moving about(749,6)tomb. At
this hour(966,8)night,(980,8)last day(996,8)week(954,7)quarter(508,9)own proved all but deserted(513,6)presently I came to a smoky light
proceeding(999,6)a low, wide building,(516,9) of which stood
invitingly open. It had a car(864,6)look, as if it(849,6)meant(473,8)
us(885,6)the public; so, enter(127,9)first thing I did was to stumble
over an ash-box(836,8)porch. Ha!(909,12)ha, as(89,6)lying
particles almost choked me, a(775,6)se ashes(799,6)that destroyed city,
Gomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and(28,6)Sword-Fish?”—this, then
must needs b(898,6)sign of(83,6)Trap.” However, I picked myself up and
hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior
door.

It seem(948,7)great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred(868,6)
faces turned round(425,7)ir rows to peer; and beyond, a(930,6) Angel of
Doom was beat(228,6)book(874,6)pulpit. It was a negro church(89,6)the
preacher’s tex(44,7)bout the(175,6)ness of darkness,(1018,8) weeping
and wailing(89,6)eeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing
out, Wretched(762,6)tainment a(145,6)(514,8)‘(514,8)!’

Moving on, I at last(1002,11)dim sort of(1008,6) not far(707,8)e
dock(216,7)heard a forlorn creak(464,7)the ai(407,7)looking up, saw a
swinging(680,7)ver the door with a white paint(60,6)on it, faintly
represe(30,6)a tall straight jet of misty spray(395,9)se words
underneath—(861,6)pouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”

(10,6)?—(37,7)?—Rather ominous(661,6)at particular connexion, thought
I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they s(182,8)I suppose this
(156,6)here is an emigrant(422,9)re. As the(455,7)looked so dim, and
the place, fo(383,6)time,(44,8)quiet enough(712,10)dilapidated
little wooden house itself(112,8)as if it might have been carted here

poverty-stricken(712,9)creak to it, I(395,8)(430,6)here w(86,7)very
spot for cheap lodging(969,11)best of pea coffee.

It was a queer(835,9)place—a gable-ended old(299,6), one side palsied
as it were(865,6)leaning(800,6)sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,
where(654,6)tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than
ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft.(84,11), nevertheless,
is a(507,6)y pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors,(1019,6)his feet on the
hob(653,6)ly toasting for bed. “In judging of(247,22)
calle(254,12),” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the
only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou
lookest out at i(944,7)a glas(417,6)ow (447,8)e frost is all(269,8)outside, or(93,13) observes(88,10)that sashle(94,9),(95,6)
(95,13)on both side(746,7)of which the wight Death i(898,6)only
glazier.” True enough,(866,9)I,(944,6)is passage occurred to my
mind—old black-letter(65,6) reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are
(306,6)(925,9)is body of mine(172,8)house. What a pity they didn’t
stop up the chinks(1004,9)crannies(211,7)(104,8)rust in a little lint
here(58,8)re. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The
universe is finished;(154,6)opesto(214,6)on(243,8)e chips were carted
off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus(166,6), chattering his teeth
against(275,6)urb(121,6)for his pillow(552,6)shak(890,6)f(64,6)atters with
his shiverings, he might plug up(630,6)ea(48,7) rag(639,7)put a
corn-cob into his mout(391,7)yet(1005,6)would not keep out the

wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh!(618,8)fin(964,7)y

oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the
privilege of m(446,6)my own(84,8)with(19,8)coals.

But(169,6)t(802,6)(582,7)? Can he warm his blue hands by holding(202,6)up

CHAPTER 3. The (34,7)-Inn.

Ent(207,6)that gable-ended(40,12), you found yourself in a wide,
low, straggling entry(997,6)old-fashioned wainscots, reminding(555,7)
the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large
oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked(566,6)every way defaced(839,7)in the
unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was(602,6)by diligent
study and a serie(217,6)ystematic visits to i(479,7)careful inquiry(281,8)neighbors(1004,7)you could an(197,6)arrive (922,6)understa(353,7)f its
purpose. Such unaccountable mass(158,7)hades(619,6)hadow(115,8)at first
you almost thought(428,6)ambitious young artist,(337,7) tim(840,7)e New
England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But(360,6)nt
of much(467,6)arnest contemplation(909,6)oft repeated ponderings, and
especial(447,6)throwing ope(187,6)little window towards the back(213,7)
entry(811,6)at last come to the conclusion(876,6)s(182,6) idea, however
wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.

But what most puzzled(582,6)onfounded you was a long, limber,
portentous, black mas(889,9)thing hovering(451,8)centr(453,8)
picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines float(80,7)a
nameless yeast. A boggy, s(7,7)quitchy (105,8)truly, enough to drive
a nervous man distracted. Ye(921,6)there a sort of indefinite,
half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it(894,6)fairly froze you to
it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find o(459,7)
that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,
deceptive idea would dart(171,6)hrough.—It’(708,6)Black Sea in a midnight
gale(39,11)unnatural combat(972,8)four primal elements(94,7)a
blasted heat(116,8)a Hyperborean winter scen(110,12)breaking-up of
the icebound stream of Time. But(882,9)all these fancies yielded to(349,6)one (765,10)(750,11)(741,7)(727,7)’s midst. _That_ once found
out,(389,6)(110,6) rest were plain(147,6)stop; does i(973,8)ar a faint
resemblance to a gigantic fish? eve(886,6)great leviathan himself?

In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,
partly based upo(1002,6)aggregated opinions of many aged persons with
whom I conver(72,13)subject. T(346,10) represents a Cape-Horner
in a(239,7)hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering(992,7)with its
three dismantled masts alone visible;(837,7) exasperated whale,
purposing to spring clean over the craft, is(566,8)enormous act of
impaling(430,8)(347,10)(158,6)mast-heads.

The opposite wall(860,6)is entry was hung all(132,6)with a(855,6)enish
arra(473,6)onstrous clubs and spears. Some(680,6)thickly set(452,6)glit(335,8)eeth (672,7)ing ivory saws; others(69,7)ufted(377,6)knots
of human hair(356,6)one was sickle-shaped,(194,8)vast handle sweeping
round like(581,6)egment made(934,8)new-mown grass by a long-armed
mower. You shud(566,6)as you gazed(960,6)wo(593,7)what(314,12)annibal
and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting(647,6)such a hacking,
horrifying implement. Mix(319,8)thes(411,7)rusty ol(656,6)ing lances
and harpoons all broken and deformed(484,12)storied weapons. With
this once lo(92,8), now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan
Swain kill fifteen(829,6)s between a sunrise(873,6) sunset. And that
(202,7)—so(490,6)a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas(441,6)run away
with(510,6)(957,6)(175,8)fterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The
original iron entered nigh(945,6)ail, and,(169,8)restless needle
sojourni(172,6)the body of a man, travelled full forty feet(647,6)at last
was found imbedded(751,8)hump.

Crossing this dusky entry(719,6)on through yon low-arched way—cut
(31,8)what in old times must(729,6)b(447,6)great central chimney with
fireplace(647,6)round—you(316,6) the public room. A still duskier place
is this,(818,11)low ponderous beams above(943,6)such(793,6)rinkled
planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s
cockpits, especially of(966,9)owling night, when(385,6)corner-anchored
old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
table covered(286,6)cracked glass cases, fill(33,8)dusty rarities
gathered from(558,6)wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting(50,8)e
further angle o(832,6)room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude
attempt at a right(935,6)’s head. Be(435,6)how it may, there(100,8)the
vast (713,7)bon(140,9)(75,8)jaw, so wide, a coach might(514,7)
drive(551,8) it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged(727,6)(669,6)old
decanters, bottles, flasks; an(938,7)ose jaws of swift destruction,
like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),
bustles a little wi(490,7)old man, who, for their money, dearly sells
the sailors deliriums and death.

Abominable are the tumblers into(173,7)he pours his poison. Though true
cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling(744,6)es
deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians
rudely pecked(192,6)the(846,6), sur(492,6)these footpads’ goblets. Fill to
_this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to (48,7)(19,7) more;
and so on (135,7)full(986,6)—the Cape Horn measure,(538,7)you may gulp
down for a shilling.

Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen ga(583,7)about
a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I
sought the landlord(313,6)telling him I desired to be accommodate(896,6)
a room, received(249,6)nswer that his house was full—not a bed
unoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapp(143,6)s forehead, “you haint no
objections to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are
goin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get us(271,6)that sort of thing.”

I told him(255,6)I never lik(326,6)sleep two in(262,6);(297,6)if I should
ever do so, it would depend upon wh(808,6)(226,10) might be(454,7)hat
if he ((484,12)) really had no other(651,7)for m(64,9)e

further(700,6) a strange town on so bitter a night, I(239,7)put up(614,6)(235,6)lf of any decent man(473,10).

“I th(728,6)so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want s(17,6)
(25,6)’ll be ready directly(476,6)sat d(187,7)an old wooden settle, carved all o(504,8) a bench on the
Battery. At one end a ruminating ta(370,6)still (324,9)dorning it(892,6)his jack-knife, stooping(122,6)and diligently working away a(1017,6)space
between his legs. H(941,6)try(890,8)hand at a ship under full sail, but
he didn’t make much headway, (410,9).

At last some four or five of us were summon(875,6)our meal in an
adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—(774,12) said
he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a
winding sheet. We(194,6)fain to button up(200,6)onkey jackets(941,6)hold
(232,7)lips cups of scalding tea with our(778,6)frozen fingers. But the
far(446,6)of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes(460,6)dumplings; good heavens! (25,9) for(825,7)! One young fellow(280,6)green box coat, addressed himself to these(87,11)in a(181,6)direful
manner.

“My boy,” said (465,12), “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead
sartainty.”

“L(61,8)” I whispered, “that ain(806,6)harpooneer is it?”

“Oh, no(139,8)he, loo(865,6) sort of diabolically funny, “the
(82,14)a dark complexioned chap. He never eats(379,10), he
don’t—he(28,6)n(692,11)steak(602,8)e likes ’em rare.”

“The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that(253,11)? Is he here?”

“He’ll b(18,6) afore long,” was the answer.

I(874,6) not help it, but I began to feel suspiciou(705,7)is “dark
(287,12)”(404,11). At any rate, I made up my mind(199,6)if it so
turned out(224,6)we should sleep together, he must undress and get into
bed before I did.

Supper over, the company went back(751,7) bar-room, when, knowing not
what else to do(1013,6)myself, I resolved to spen(774,6)rest(1008,7)
evening as a looker on.

Presently a riot(114,6)ise was heard without. Starting up(205,6)(873,8)
cried, “That’(486,6)Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing
this morning; a three years’ voyage(704,6)a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now
we(1011,13)latest news from the Feegees.”

A tramping of sea boots(257,11)(167,7)entry; the door was flung
open(859,6)in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Envelop(261,9)ir
shaggy watch coat(943,7)with(35,6) heads muffl(319,6)woollen comforters,
all bedarned and ragged(1020,6)(72,6)beards stiff(590,6)icicles, they
seemed an eruption of bear(324,7)Labrador. They had just landed from
(107,7)oat(123,8)i(342,6)the first house they entered. No wond(817,7)n,
that(36,6)made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—(851,7)—when the
wrinkled little old Jonah, ther(646,6)ciating, soon poured them out
brimmers all round. On(980,6)lained of a bad cold in his head, upon
which(120,6) mixed him a pitch-like po(368,8)gin and molasses, (63,6)he
swor(932,6)a sovereign cur(272,6)all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never
mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of(518,9),
or o(973,6)weather side of an ice-island.

The liquor(357,6)mounted into(742,12), as it generally does even
(786,8) arrantest topers newly(646,12) sea(762,9)y began
capering about most obstreperously.

I observed, how(310,6)that one of(536,6)held somewhat aloof(873,8)ough
he (845,7)desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his
own sober face, yet up(369,8)hole he refr(646,6)from making as much
noise (894,7)rest. This man interested me at once; and since the
sea-gods had ord(753,6)that he should(824,6)become my(202,9) ((271,7)but a sleeping-partner one, so far(163,6)is narrative is concerned), I
will here venture(270,6)a(988,8)descrip(840,8)him. He stood full six
feet in height, with nobl(206,8)ers(571,6)a chest like a coffer-dam. I
have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His fac(948,6)deeply brown and
burnt,(435,8)his white teeth dazzling by(896,7)ntrast; while in the
deep shadows(587,8)eyes floate(679,6) reminiscences(720,6)did not seem
to give him much joy(191,6)voic(542,9) announc(515,11)was a
Southerner(887,6)from his fine stature, I(801,7)t he must be(857,7)
those tall mountaineers(976,6)the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When
(743,6)velr(856,9)companion(708,6)mounted to its(519,9)t(790,7)
slipped away unobserved(991,6)I saw no more(613,7) t(664,6) became my
comrade (940,7)sea. In a few minutes, however,(326,8)missed(1022,8)(837,8)(653,7)being, i(432,6)s, for(475,8)ason a huge favourite with
them, they raised a c(284,6)“Bulkington! (12,12)where’s
(32,10)?” and darted out of the house in pursuit(888,8)

It was now about nine o’clock(864,6)the ro(832,6)ming almost
supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself
upon a little plan(693,7)ad occurr(519,6)me just previous to the
entrance(237,8)seamen.

No man prefers to sleep two(1020,6)bed. In fact, you would a good deal
rather(898,6)leep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but
people like to be private when(503,6)are(159,6)ing. And(28,6)it comes to
(31,8)(131,6)an unknown stranger,(215,6)(15,7) inn(18,15)town,
(469,6)at(56,9) a harpooneer, then(226,7)bjections indefinitely
multiply. Nor was there any earthly(752,8)why I as a sailor should(206,6)(396,13),(943,6)than anybody else;(837,6)ailors(982,9)sleep
(460,12) at sea,(66,6)bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure(379,7)ll(142,8)ogether in one apartment, but you have(511,10)hamm(809,8)
cover yourself(553,16)lanket(851,6)(648,6)i(358,8)wn skin.

The(261,6)I pondered over this(421,16)(42,8)abominated the
thought of(593,9)(693,6)him. (1009,7)fair to presume(882,6)being a
(525,12)his linen or woollen, (498,6) case might be,(830,7)not be of
the tidiest, certainly non(941,9)finest. I began to twitch all over.
Besides, i(188,6)getting late(336,6)my decent(712,11) (262,6)(880,6)home
and going bedwards. Suppose now, he(669,7) tumble in upon me at
midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?

“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about(925,6)(914,10).—I shan’t(757,7)(462,11)’ll try the bench here.”

“Just as you please; I’m sorry I c(82,6)pare ye a tablecloth for a
mattress(693,6)it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling(474,8)knots and
notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander;(274,6)got a carpenter’s plane
there in(234,6)ar—wait, I say(853,6)I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying
he procur(813,6)(93,6); and(804,8)s old silk handkerchief first dusting
(368,9), vigorously set to planing away at my bed(948,6)while grinning
like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the
plane-iron came bump against an indestructibl(405,6)(104,6)l(649,7) was
near spraining his wrist(345,7) told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the
bed was soft(381,7) to suit m(939,7)I did not know how all(396,9)ing
(485,7)world(872,7)make eider down of a pin(449,6)k. So gathering up the
(331,9)with another grin(721,6)throwing them into the great stove in
the middle(730,8)room, he went(947,7)his busin(815,9)left me in a
brown study.

I now took the measur(95,9)(599,7)and found that it was a foot too
short; but(34,6)(298,6)be mende(720,7)a chair. Bu(68,20)narrow(271,8)e (291,6)bench(876,8)room(123,6)bout four inches higher
tha(919,6)planed one—so (946,6)was no yok(362,8). I then plac(903,6)
(861,6)(120,6)lengthwise alo(415,6) only cl(680,6)ace(740,9)the wall,
leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle(594,6)in(292,6)I
soon(378,12)(200,6)came such a draught of cold air over me from
under the sill(568,8)window,(86,8)is plan would never do at all,
especially as(702,9)current from(653,6)ickety door me(273,6)on(137,7)(119,12)and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds(770,8)immediate vicinity(782,8)spot where I had thought to spe(601,6)
night.

The devil fetch(732,6)harpooneer,(62,9)I, but stop,(731,6)n’t I steal
a march on him—bol(899,6)door inside(996,6)jump(987,6)his bed, not to be
wakened by(904,6)ost violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea(889,6)upon
secon(248,9)s I dismissed it. For who(929,7)tell but w(605,7) next
morning, so soon as I popped out(581,8)room, the(310,11) might be
standing(957,8)entry, all ready to(218,6) m(760,6)!

Still, lo(931,6)round m(866,7)(567,6)seeing no possible chance of
spe(116,6)a sufferable night unless in some (708,6)person’(399,7)I began
to think(885,6)after all I(222,9) cherishing unwarrantable prejudices
agains(864,7)unknown(609,11). Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be
dropp(330,7)before long.(54,6)have a good look at him the(307,7)perhaps
we may become jolly(55,6)bedfellows(237,10)—there’s no telling.

But(853,7)(989,6)ther boarders kept com(172,8)y ones, twos(1013,6)threes,
and going(767,6)d, yet no sign of my(298,12)

“Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such
late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.

The l(126,7) chuckled(659,6) with his lean(29,8)(681,9)med(991,7)mightily ti(63,7)t something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he
answered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley(341,7) and (18,9)
rise—yes,(57,6)the bird(1021,6)catche(22,6)worm. But to-(829,6)he went out
a peddling, you se(242,7)I don’t see(85,6)on airth keeps him so late,
(911,6),(658,7), he ca(62,6)ll his head.”

“C(24,18)?—W(508,14)bamboozingly story is(890,6)you are
(710,7) me?” gett(851,6)to a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,
(519,8), tha(985,7)(977,10) is actually engaged(1021,6)blessed
Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in(358,9)(269,9) around
this town?”

“That’s precisely it,(804,7)t(698,11), “(420,6)told him he couldn’t
sell it here, the market’s overstocke(398,6)With what?” shouted I.(25,8)heads(981,6) sure; ain’t there too many(39,7)in(624,8)ld?”

“I tell you(662,6)it is,(196,10)(1020,8) quite calmly, “you’d better
stop spinning(425,6)yarn to me—I’m not green.”

“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I
rayther guess you’ll be done _brown_ if(565,6)ere(564,12)hear(676,7)

“It’s broke a’ready(597,8)he.

“Broke(400,9)—“_broke_, d(826,6)mea(671,6)Sartain, and t(684,6)the very reason(1020,15)it, I(332,6).”

“L(510,16), going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a
snow-storm—“(958,10)stop(468,10). You (798,6)must understand one
another(195,10) too without delay. I come to your house(571,6)ant a

not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
exasperating stories tending(1022,6)get in me an uncomfor(633,7)eeling
toward(527,6)man(161,6)you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion,
(470,10)which is an intimat(387,6)confidential one in the highest
degree. I now demand of(431,6)o speak out(708,6)(448,7)who(480,6)(423,6)is

sir, by try(607,7)induce (880,6)do so knowingly, would thereby render
yourself liable(834,7)riminal prosecution.”

“Wall,” said the(148,11)fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long
sarmo(713,6)a chap(981,6)rips a little now(601,6)hen. But be easy, be

This account cleared up the otherwise un(35,7)able myster(321,7)showe(397,7)(738,14)after all, had had(978,11) fooling me—but (62,6)
same time what could I think of a(696,12)who stayed(296,8)a
Saturday nigh(210,6)n into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
business as(525,7)g(65,6)eads of dead idolators?

“Depend upon it,(1003,11)that(880,12)is a dangerous man.”

“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful

afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny(200,6)e

somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor(791,6)came near breaking his arm.

_do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”

I consider(726,7)matter a momen(492,6) then up stairs(756,6)(28,8)I was
ushered into a small room, cold as a clam(530,6)furnished, sure enough,
with a prodigious bed, almost big(42,7) indeed for any four(302,11)s to sleep abreast.

“There,”(611,6)the landlord, placi(307,6)(544,8)on a crazy old sea chest
that did double duty(224,6)wash-stand(759,6)entre table; “t(699,6)make
yourself comfortable now(816,6)good(875,6) to ye.” I turned round from
eye(180,8)bed, but he had disappeared.

Folding back(659,7)unterpane,(723,7)ped over(79,8). Though none of
the most elegant, it yet(785,7)the scrutiny tolerably well. I then
glanc(196,9)the room; and besides(206,8)stea(326,18),
could see no other(588,6)ture belong(956,7)the place(281,6)a rude shelf,
the four walls(741,6)a papered fireboard representing a man stri(1002,6)
whale. Of things not properly(142,18)(783,6)there was a
hammock lashed up(879,8)rown upon the floor in one corner; also a
large seaman’s bag, contain(721,8)(792,10)’s wardrobe, no doubt in
lieu of a land trunk. Likewise(181,13) parcel of outlandish bone

arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it

tinkling tags some(82,6)like(919,6)tained porcupine quills(904,7)an
Indian moccasin. T(496,11)hole or slit i(658,6)middle(412,6)is(172,6)as

that any sober(702,11) would get into a(297,11)and parade the
streets of any Christian town(197,6)at sort of guise? I put it on, to
try(539,9)it weighed me down(352,6)a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy
(977,6)ick(988,6)I thought a(449,7) damp, as(26,7)(339,7)ysterious
(258,11)had been wear(599,6)(951,6)rainy day. I went up in it to a bit
of glass stuck agains(874,6)wall(160,8)never saw such a sight in my
life. I tore myself out of (542,6)(52,7)hurry(358,6)I gav(45,9)a kink
(584,7)neck.

I sat(342,6)(977,7)sid(607,7)e bed(973,6)commenced thinking about this
head-peddling(567,11)(1001,6)his(856,9). After(70,10)some time on
(115,7)-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacke(641,7)then stood i(72,6)(808,12)e room(187,9). I(49,6)(85,12)co(717,8)(550,9)
(550,7)more(389,6) shirt sleeve(842,7)beginning to feel very cold now,
half undressed as I was(826,6)remembering wha(532,6)landlord said(361,6)
the(913,11)’s not coming home at all(863,6)night,(991,6)(358,6) very
late, I made no(218,6)ado, but jumped(597,8)my pantaloons and boots,(855,7)en blowing (520,6)e light tumbled into(577,16)ded(699,7)
to the care of heaven.

Whether(705,6)mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
there is no telling(227,6)I rolle(341,7) a good dea(900,7)could not
sleep for a long time. At last I slid off(233,6)a(254,7)doze(759,7)ad
pretty nearly(374,6)(115,7)off(563,6)wards(502,9) of Nod, when I heard
a heavy footfall (964,7)passag(112,7)saw a glimmer of(399,7)come into
(776,9)from under the door.

L(625,6)ve me,(999,6)s I,(393,7)ust be (646,14), the infernal
head-peddler(796,6)I lay perfectly stil(362,7)resolved not to say a word
till spoken to. Holding(356,9)in one han(605,7)that identical New
Zealand head(303,8)oth(180,8)stranger entered (285,8)(918,6)without
look(423,16)bed, placed his candl(472,9)way off(356,6)me on
the floor(185,8)corner(187,8)en began working away a(851,6)knotted
cords of(553,7)rge bag I before(302,6) of as(1011,7)(547,7)room. I was
all eagerness to see his face(800,6)he kept it averted for some time
while employed in unlacing(285,6)ag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,
he turned round—when,(910,6)heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was
of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here(363,8)re stuck over with
(333,7)lackish (498,8)squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a
terrible bedfellow;(27,6)been in a fight, got dreadfully cut(957,6)here
he is,(104,6)from(682,6)urgeon(848,6)at(911,7)oment he chanced to turn his
face so(694,13)l(128,6)that I plainly saw they coul(907,6)be
sticking-plasters at all, thos(301,7)(290,8) on(775,6)heeks. They were
stains of(575,6)sort or(902,6). At first I knew not(497,6)to ma(717,6)this;
but soon an inkling(778,8)truth occurr(261,6)me. I remembered a story(555,6)white man—a whaleman too—who, falling amo(719,7)cannibals, had
been tattooed by them. I concluded(415,6)this harpooneer,(909,8)course
of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And
what is it,(655,8) I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be
honest in any(418,7)f ski(624,7)then,(407,17)his unearthly
complexion(607,7)pa(71,6)it, I mean, lying(1003,6) abo(759,8)(60,6)tely
independent(478,8)(610,9)f(373,7)ing. To be sure, it might be
nothing but a good coa(77,6)ropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot
sun’s(42,8)(564,12) into a purplish yellow one. However, I had
(90,6)(1023,8)the South Seas; and perhap(925,6)sun there produced these
extraordinary effects upo(592,6)(425,6)Now, while all(58,6) ideas(904,6)passing through me like lightning,(689,16)(281,7)noticed me at
all. But(613,8)some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced
fumbling in i(516,7)presently pulled out a(653,9)tomahawk(561,6)a
seal-skin wall(808,8)the hair on. Plac(241,6)ese (300,7)old ch(750,6)
the middle(620,8)room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly
(622,6)enough—and crammed it dow(559,7)the bag. He now(90,6)off his
hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing ou(237,7)fresh surprise.
There was no(262,8) his(178,6)none to speak of at least—(818,13)
small scalp-knot twisted up(80,8)forehead. His bald(781,10)head now
looked for(655,8) world(629,6)a mildewed skull. Had not(1010,6)tranger
stood between me and the door, I would have bolt(567,7)of it quicker
than ever I(37,8)a dinner.

Even as it was, I thought some(478,6)of slipp(383,8)(557,7)window, but
(63,6)(967,6)econd floor back. I am no coward, but what to mak(639,7)is
head-peddling(342,6)e rascal altogether passed my comprehension.
Ignorance i(141,6)parent of fear(875,6)being completely nonplussed and
confounded abou(404,14), I confess I(622,7)w as much afraid of
him as if(346,7)(439,6)evil himself who had thus broke(814,7)my room at
(54,6)ad of night. In fact,(127,7)so(118,10) him that(155,9)t game
(928,6) just(987,8) address him(280,6)demand a satisfactory answer
concerning(442,6)seemed inexplicable in him.

Meanwhile, he continue(699,6)business of undressing(410,6)at last showed
his chest(29,6)rms. As I live, these covered parts(260,8)were
checkered with(858,6)ame squares as(975,6)ace; his back, too, was all
over(58,10)dark(63,8); he(262,8)to(900,7)een in a Thirty Years’
W(635,8)just escaped from it(158,6)a sticking-plaster shirt. Still
more, his very legs were marked,(621,7)a parcel of(174,6)green frogs
were running up the trunks of young palms. I(976,6)now quite plain that
he must be some abominable savage or oth(195,6)pp(840,6)ard of a whaleman
in the South Seas(927,6)so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to
think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhap(902,6)(22,6)of his own
brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at(875,6)tomahawk!

But there(894,7) time for shuddering, for now(657,7)vage went about
something(969,6)completely fascinated my attention(957,6)convinced me
that (423,8)indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,
or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in
the pocket(483,7)produce(1009,6)ength a curious little deformed image
(805,7)hunch on it(944,8)and exactly the colour(620,6)three days’ old
Congo baby. Remember(363,6)e embalmed head, at first I almost thought(350,6)this black manikin was a real baby preserv(713,6)some similar
manner. But see(493,9)i(886,8)t at all limber(793,6)(35,8)glistened
a good deal like polished ebony, I conclude(63,10)(956,8)nothing
but a wooden idol(488,8)(569,7)it proved to be. F(704,17)
goes up to(331,7)pty fire-place(985,6)remov(366,8)papered(37,6)board,
set(70,6)hi(519,9)hunch-back(523,8),(235,6)a tenpin, between the
andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,
so(988,6)I(501,8)(496,6)(210,10) made a(53,6)appropriate(702,8)shrine
or chapel for his (642,6)idol.

I now screw(981,6)eyes hard towards the half hidden(259,8)feeling but
ill at ease meantime—to see wha(596,7)ext to follow. First he takes
about a double handful of shavings out of his grego(979,7)(978,7)laces
them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit(98,6)ip biscuit on
top(428,6)pply(926,8)flame from the lamp, he kindled(653,6)(171,8)into
a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatche(63,6) the
fir(700,7)still hastier withdrawals(275,8)fingers (whereby he seemed
to be scorch(767,7)m badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the
(288,7)(323,7)blo(30,6)ff(546,6)eat(736,6)shes a(830,7), h(682,9)polite
offer of it(942,8)(874,7)negro. B(113,6)(896,8)devil did not seem to
fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved (980,6)ps. A(900,6)se
strange antics(903,6)accompanied by(377,7)(41,7)r guttural noises from
the devotee, who(377,7) (377,6)pr(624,6)in a sing-song or else singing
some pagan psalmody or other, during which(496,6)ace twitched (831,6)in
the most unna(170,6)manner. A(487,7)extinguis(525,8) (615,6)he took the
idol up very unceremoniously(881,6)bagged it again in(922,17)
as carelessly as if he(359,7) sportsman bagg(914,6)dead woodcock.

(427,9) queer proceed(869,7)creased my uncomfortableness(823,7)eeing
him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
operation(85,7)jump(465,6)to bed with me, I thought it was high time,
now or(659,6), before(767,7)gh(46,6)put out, to break the spell in(509,6)
I had so long been bound.

(827,8)interval I spent in deliberat(583,6)at to say, was a fatal one.
Taking up his tomahawk from the tab(987,7)examined the head(985,7)for
an instant(561,6)then holding(1021,13)ght,(323,6)his mouth at the
hand(107,7)puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment
(356,14)(766,10)ed(153,8)is wild cannibal,(245,10)between
his teeth, spra(510,19). I sang(450,6)I could not help it
now; and giv(751,6)sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.

Stammeri(105,6) something, I knew not what, I rolled away(447,6)him
agains(554,6)wall(415,11)conjured him, whoever or whatever he might
be, to keep quie(486,7)let me get up(18,6)igh(663,6)lamp again. But his
guttural responses satisfied me at once tha(274,6)ut ill comprehended my
meaning.

“Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-(960,6)kill-e.”
And so saying(936,10)ed(540,12)gan flourishing about me in the
dark.

“Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. (53,9)! Watch!
(38,7) Angels! save me!”

“S(203,6)! tell-ee me who-ee be, or(228,17)!”(396,6) growl(964,6)
(770,10)while his horrid(232,12)(886,6)he(807,10)scatter(70,7)hot(917,9)ashes(281,10)till I thought my linen would get on fire.
But thank heaven, at(520,6)(985,6)(596,7)(346,6) came(916,6)the room(1013,6)
in han(1004,7)leaping(781,6)the bed I ran up to him.

“Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning(718,6), “Queequeg here(205,6)n’t
harm a hair of your head.”

“Stop(19,6)(79,8),(513,11), “and why didn’t you tell m(783,7)that
infernal harpooneer was a (460,8)?”

“(371,10)ye know’d it;—(92,7)I(90,6)ye, he(64,7)peddlin’ heads
around town?—but turn flukes(586,7)and go to sleep. (279,8), look
here—you sabbee (883,6)(13,6)—you this man(64,6)e you(48,11)?”

“Me(62,8)plenty”—grunted(109,11)puffing away at his pipe and
sitting up in bed.

“You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his(764,9), and
throwing the clothes to one side. He really did(234,6)in not only a
civil but a(42,8)kind and charitable way. I stood looking(229,6)m a
(795,6). For all(170,6)attooings(477,8)on the whole a clean, comely
(84,8)(576,8). What’s all(418,6)fuss I have been ma(134,6)bout,
(989,8)I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just
as much reason to fear me,(48,6)have to(933,11)of him. Better(644,6)
with a sober(787,9) than a drunken Christian.

“Landlord(1009,8)I, “tell him to stas(515,14) there, or pipe, or
whatever you call it;(960,6)(72,9)op smoking, in short, and I will
turn in(629,8)m. But I don’t fancy having a(824,6)(79,6)(730,7) with
me. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”

This(414,7)told to(968,11)he at once complied(178,6)again politely
(823,6)ed me to get into bed—rolling over(804,12) (499,8)as to
say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”

“Good night, l(439,19)you may go.”

I turned in(358,6)nev(552,6)pt b(565,6)in my life.


CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.

Upon w(762,6)next morn(775,9) dayl(154,6)I found(326,9)’s arm thrown
over me i(916,6)most lo(468,6)nd affectionate manner. You had almost(881,11)had(914,6)his wife(185,6)c(185,10)(1024,6)f patchwork, full of
odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;(15,6)hi(207,6)of his
tattooed all(482,6)(898,6)n interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no
two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his
keeping (163,8)at sea unmethodically in sun and(78,6), his shirt
sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same(274,11), I
say, looked for all the world like a strip of that(70,6)(421,9)
quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as th(121,6)did when I first awoke, I
could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues
together(508,6)it(590,6)nly by the sense of weight and pressure(217,6)(133,8)tell(235,6)(792,8) was hugging me.

My sensations(512,6)strange. Let me try to expla(835,6)m. W(253,6)was a
child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstanc(173,7)befell me;
whether(245,8)a reality or a dream, I never (360,6)entirely settl(908,6)
(101,13)was this.(956,12)cutting up some caper or other—I
think(382,8)trying to crawl up the chimney, as(92,7)seen a(994,7)
sweep do a few days previou(986,7)my stepmother who, somehow(140,9),
was(718,9)time whipp(449,6), or send(464,6) to bed supperless,—my
(96,7)dragged me(587,8)legs out(787,6)(210,9)(595,6)ack(45,6)off to
bed, though(663,13)two o’clock (543,6) afternoon(89,8)21st June,
the longest day(51,8)year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But
ther(476,6)no help for it, so up stairs I went to my(407,7) room(169,7)
third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,
and with a bitter sigh got betwee(280,6)sheets.

I lay (197,6)dismally calculating(968,6)sixteen(741,7) hours must elapse
before I(781,7)hope for a resurrection. S(73,7)(66,6)in bed!(146,6)mall
of my back ached to (770,6)of it. And(918,8)so light too;(214,6)un
shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches(394,8)streets(48,6)the sound of gay voice(775,6)over the hous(545,10)worse(392,6)orse—at last I got up, (477,7)(146,6)softly going down in my
stockinged feet, sought out(942,14)(71,7)uddenly threw(568,9)t
her(65,7)beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
slippering for my misbehaviour; anyth(371,6)deed but condemning me to
lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But sh(854,6)the best and
most conscientious of(268,11)(438,7)back I had to go(887,7)room. For
several(713,7)(772,12)broad awake, feeling(566,9)deal(480,6) than
I have ever done since, even from the(626,6)est subsequent misfortunes.
A(546,9)must(84,6)fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and
slowly waking(124,6)it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eye(748,10)(968,8)sun-lit room was now wrap(72,7)outer darkness. Instantly(773,7)
a shock running through all my frame; no(569,6)was to be seen, and
(28,18)heard; but a supernatural hand seemed plac(237,6)mine.
My arm hung(946,10)counterpane(1000,10)nameless, unimaginable,
silent form or phantom, to which the(131,6)belonged,(141,8)closely
seated by my bed-side. For what(188,8)ages piled on ages,(669,12),
frozen wit(118,6)most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet
e(264,6)ink(412,6)at if I coul(960,6)stir it (725,7)gle inch,(236,6)orrid
spell w(52,6)e broken. I knew not how this(947,7)ousness a(752,7)glided
away(814,6)me(479,6)(710,7)in(229,7)rning, I shudderingly remembered it
all(1021,6)for days and week(10,6)months afterwards I lost myself in
confounding attempts to expla(141,8)ystery. Nay, to(224,6)very hour, I
often puzzle(94,8)with it.

Now, take(408,6)the(449,11)(905,6)my sensations at feel(838,6)e
(761,18)(747,7) were(138,6)similar,(322,7)ir strangeness, to
those(703,7)I experienc(633,6)(383,7)up (856,7)ing Queequeg’s pagan arm
thrown round me. But at lengt(1006,6)the past night’s events soberly
recurred, one by one, in fixed reality(934,9)n(785,7)only alive(207,6)e comical predicament(866,6)though I tried to move his arm—unlock his
bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,
as(115,8)naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse
him—“(374,8)!”—but his(250,7)nswer was a snore. I(288,6)rolled over, my
neck(578,9)as if it(557,6)in a horse-collar;(498,6)uddenly felt a
slight scratch. Throw(273,6)ide (381,6)unterpane, there l(734,7)tomahawk
(328,9)b(759,6)savage’s side,(155,15)a hatchet-faced baby. A
pretty pickle, truly,(483,7)t I; abed h(222,9)(761,7) house(784,7)
broad day,(921,6)a cannibal and a(180,9)! (386,10)—(845,6) name of
good(848,6)(795,8), wake!” A(770,8), by dint of much wriggling, and
loud (965,6)cessant expostul(1023,7)upo(120,6)unbecomingness of his
hugging a fellow mal(232,7)at matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in
extract(75,6)grunt(524,6)presently, he drew ba(815,6) arm, shook himself
all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water(988,6)sat up in
bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me(57,6)rubbing his eyes(740,6)
he did not altogether remember how I came to be(693,6)(586,8) a dim
conscious(370,8)kn(761,6)something about me seemed slowly dawning over
him. Meanwhi(379,6)lay quietly eye(191,6)m, having no serious misgivings
now(299,6)bent(536,6)narrowly observ(155,6) cu(60,6)a creature. When, at
last, his mind(183,8)made up touching(981,6)haracter(621,7) bed(614,6),
and he becam(957,7)(954,6), reconciled to the fact; he jumped ou(192,6)
the floo(516,7)by certain signs(537,6)ounds gave (430,6)understand that,
if it pleased me, he would dress first (49,6)en le(77,10)dress
afterwards, le(390,6)the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I(1024,11)
under(316,6)ircumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the
truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you
will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this
particular compli(260,8)(242,9) because he treated me with so much
(237,6)ty and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;
star(1014,7)him from the bed(786,6)wat(695,6)all his toilette motions; for
the time my(805,6)sity gett(755,8)bet(752,7)my breeding. Nevertheless,
a man like(507,9) you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well
worth unusual regarding.

He commence(706,7)(254,7)top by donning(916,7)aver hat,(606,8)tall
one, by(296,6)y(864,6)then—still minus(299,6)rowsers—he hunted up his
boots. What(884,6) the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his
next movement was to crush himself—boots in han(464,7)hat on—(847,9)
bed; when,(510,6)sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he
was hard at work boot(329,6)mself; though by no law of propriety that I
ever heard of, is any man required to be private when pu(615,6)on(349,12)But(846,11)do you see, was a creature in the transition
stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough (916,6)zed
to show off his outlandishness(119,8)strangest possible manners. His
education was not yet completed(132,9)an(586,6)graduate. If he had not
been a small degree(172,10), he(738,6)probably would not have troubled
(604,7) with (609,6)at all; but then, i(123,12) been (797,6)a savage,
he never(105,7)have dreamt of ge(467,6)(797,10)b(508,6)p(100,6)m on. At
last, he emerged(152,6)his hat(949,6)much dented and(804,6)ed down over
his eyes(972,6)began creaking and limping abo(228,6) room, as if,(352,7)ing(108,6)accustom(686,7)oots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide
ones—(385,9)not made to order (656,6)—rather pinch(211,7)torm(225,6)him
a(163,6)first go off of a bitter cold morning.

Seeing, now,(905,6)there were no curtains to the window(300,6)(47,8)
street (262,6)very narr(82,6)e house opposite commanded a plain view
in(98,7)(349,7)nd observing more and(9,6)the indecorous figure that
(1012,8) made, stav(443,10)with little else but(558,9)and(722,7)on;
I begg(339,6) as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and
particularly to get into(530,7)ntaloons as soon as possible. He
complied(369,8)en proceed(786,6)wash (918,7). At(451,7)ime in the
(491,7) any Christian(888,12)washed his face(970,6)(328,8), to my
amazement, cont(623,9)self(886,6)restricting his ablutio(570,6)his
chest, arm(875,7)hands. He(216,6)donn(136,7)waistco(325,7) t(908,6)up a
piece of hard soap on(666,6)ash-stand centre table, dipped i(378,7)water
and commenced lather(187,8)face. I was watching to see where he kept
his razor, when lo(584,6)ehold, he takes(775,6)arpoon from the bed
corner, slips ou(957,6)long wooden stock, unsheath(77,8)ead, whets it
a(727,8)on his boo(316,7)strid(318,7)(963,7)bit of mirror agains(968,6)wall, begins a vig(866,6)scraping, or rather(207,8)ing of his cheeks.
Thinks I,(582,12)his is using Rogers’s best cutlery(927,6)a
vengeance. Afterwards I wondered(290,6)ess at(88,6)operation(389,6)I came
to know of what fine steel(322,9) of a(409,9)is made(669,7)ow
exceedingly sharp(413,10)straight edges are always kept.

The rest(285,8)toilet w(1001,9)chiev(985,8)he proudly marched out of
the room, wrapped up i(486,6)great pilot monkey jacke(507,8)por(911,8)
(638,8)like a marshal’s baton.


CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.

I quickly followed sui(922,7)descending(860,6)the bar-room accost(433,6)
grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice to(513,6)him,
though he had been skylarking(577,6)me not (786,9)in the matter of my
bedfellow.

However, a good laugh is a mighty(23,6)thing(851,6)(769,7)too scarce a
(36,10);(111,6)ore’(1016,6)pity. So, if any one man,(455,8)own proper
person, afford stuff for(157,8)joke to anybody, let him not be
backward, but(29,9)cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in
that way. An(881,6)man that has anything bounti(91,6)laughable about
him, be sure there is mor(404,7)at(85,8)n you perhaps think for(838,7)(592,9)was now full of(621,6)oarders who(532,10)dropp(661,6) the
night previous(993,6)whom I had(560,6)s yet had(521,9)ook at. They were
near(325,6) whalemen; chief mate(90,7)second(18,12)thir(17,8)
(35,6)a carpenter(55,9)a coop(17,13)blacksmith(183,6)(968,8)e(55,10)hip keepers; a brown(465,6)rawny company,(799,6)bosky
beards; an unshorn, shaggy set,(226,6)earing monkey jackets for morning
gowns.

You could pretty plainly tell how long each on(957,11)ashore. This
young (921,6)’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue(287,6)would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have(563,6)three days
landed from his Indian voyage. T(698,8)nex(893,6)looks a few shades
lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. I(689,6)complexion of a(577,7)still lingers a tropic tawn(1009,6)slightly
bleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks(400,9)But who
(469,6)show a(393,7)like Queequeg? which, barr(111,7) various tints,
seemed(446,6)the Andes’ western slope, to(103,6)forth in one array,
contrasting cli(875,7)zone by zone.

“Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door(948,6)in we
went to breakfast.

They say that men who(569,6)s(569,6)e world, thereby become quite at ease
in manner,(25,7)self-possessed in(938,8). Not always, though:
Ledyar(102,6) great New England travelle(208,7)Mungo Park(49,6)Scotch
one; of all men, they (133,10)the least assurance i(228,6)parlor. But
perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as(206,8) did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in
the negro heart of Africa,(666,6) wa(167,6)sum of poor(285,6)’s
performances—this kind of(334,7), I say, may not b(706,6)very best mode
of attain(190,6)high social polish. Still, f(234,7)most part,(598,6)sort
of thing is to be had anywhere(650,6)se reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
after we were all seated at(388,7)ble(787,6)I was preparing t(356,6) some
good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man
maintained a profound silence. And not onl(895,6), but(692,6)looked
embarrassed. Yes,(271,6)(222,6) set of sea-dogs, many of whom witho(80,6)
slightest bashfulness had boarded(883,7)whales o(1016,6)(491,6)eas—entire
strangers to them—and duell(862,6)m dead(123,9)winking; and yet(191,6)
they sat at a(588,8)breakfast(421,6)—all of(733,6)ame calling, (25,6)
kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
had never been ou(340,6)igh(349,6)ome(76,6)fold among the Green
Mountains. A curious(61,6); these(369,8) bears,(21,7)timid warrior
whalemen!

But as for Queequeg—why,(14,9) s(715,6)re(140,10)m—(735,7)head of
(747,11)too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I
cannot say much for his breeding. His(565,6)est admirer coul(725,6)have
cordially justified(70,7)inging his harpoon into(518,11)with him,
and using i(251,8)(732,8)ceremony; reaching over(1004,10)(71,6)it,
(690,6) imminent jeopardy of(824,6)heads, and grappli(490,7)beefsteaks
towards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and
every one knows that in most people’s estimation, to do anything(89,7)
is(25,7)it genteelly.

We will not speak of all(592,9)’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
coffee and hot roll(286,7)appl(458,8)undivided attention to
(307,10),(258,6)rare. Enough,(244,6)when(496,12)as(444,6)h(479,6)drew
like the rest(546,6)the public room, light(601,7)tomahawk-pipe(460,6)was
sitt(462,7)re quietly digesting and smoking(632,8)s inseparable hat
on,(180,6)I sallied out for a stroll.


CHAPTER 6. The Street.

If I had been astonished at first cat(707,6)a glimpse of so outlandish
an i(371,6)ual as(470,9) circula(208,6)mo(700,7)polite society of a
civilized town(398,7)(145,8)ment soon departed upon taking my(173,6)
daylight(250,7) through the streets of New Bedford.

In thoroughfares ni(51,7)docks, any conside(377,6)seaport will
frequently offer to view the queerest lo(457,6)nondescripts from foreign
parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut(197,8), Mediterranean mariners
will sometimes jostl(684,6)affr(660,7)ladies. Regent(525,7) is not
unknown to Lascars and Malays;(875,6)t Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live
Yankees have often scared the natives. But(399,12) beats all Water
(157,7)and Wapping. In these last-m(993,6)ed haunts you see only
sailors; but in(507,12), actual cannibals stand cha(922,6)a(369,8)
corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy
flesh. It makes(932,6)anger stare.

But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
and Brighg(17,6) and(89,14)wild specimens of(22,6)haling-craft
which unheeded reel about(852,12), you (636,6)ee other sights still
more curious, certainly (24,6)omical. There weekly arrive(610,6)is town
scores of green Vermonte(677,7)New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain
and glory(704,8)fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;
fellows who(741,6)felled forest(368,6) now seek to drop(907,6)xe and
snatch(373,9)e-lance. Man(133,6)as(232,7)a(522,6)Green Mountains whence
they came. In some thing(779,6)would think them but a few hours old.
Look there! that chap stru(779,6)roun(955,6)(779,6). He wears a beaver hat
and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a (920,6)-bel(989,6)sheath-knife.
He(535,6)es an(591,6)(56,8)ou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.

No town-bred dandy(668,6)compare(131,8)country(39,6)one—I mean a
downright bumpkin(70,6)—a (501,6) that,(573,8)dog-days,(770,6)mow his
two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
(166,7)(200,7)like(784,7)akes it into(60,6)ead to make a distinguished
reputation(665,6)join(597,6)great(641,7)(776,7)(976,6)should see the
(934,7)(603,8)he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeak(223,7)
sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons (205,7)waistcoats; strap(26,8)
canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterl(508,7)burst those
(80,7)(1020,9)rst howling gale,(380,6)thou art driven,(136,7),
(171,7)(994,6)all, dow(524,6)throat of(14,6)empest.

But(899,7)not(865,6)this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,
and(657,8)s to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a
queer place. Had it not been for us(526,6)men,(171,7)ract of land would
this day perhaps have(69,6)in as(338,9)condition a(625,6)coast of
Labrador. A(714,6)s, parts of her back(935,8) are enough to frighten
one, they look so bony. The(343,6)itself is(170,9)the dearest(264,6) to
live in, in a(312,7)England. It is a(256,6)of oil, tru(146,8): but not
like Canaan;(49,7), also, of corn and wine(164,6)streets do not run
with milk; nor(680,8)spring-time do(243,6)pave them with fresh eggs.
Yet, in spite(657,6)is, nowhere(230,8)America(804,6)you find more
patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New
(632,7). Whence came they? how planted upon(783,6)once scraggy scoria of
a(517,8)?

Go(125,7)ze(57,8)e iron emblematical(836,8)s round yonder lofty
mansion(960,6)your question(264,6)be answered. Yes; all these brave
(269,6) and flowery(270,9)came from the Atlantic, Pacific(117,6)Indian
oceans. One and all(716,7)were(196,8)ed and dragged up hither(102,9)
bottom(485,6)e sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?

In New (432,7), fathers(857,7)say, give whales for dowers to their
daughters(343,6)portion off(33,6) nieces(681,6)a few porpoises a-piece.
You must go to(149,12) to see a brilliant wedding; for(172,11)
they have reservoirs(951,7) in every(721,6)(516,6)(17,6)night recklessly
burn(189,7)lengths(849,6)ermaceti candles.

In summer time, the town is sweet(191,7); full of fine maples—long
avenues of green(868,6)old. And in August, high in ai(246,6) beautiful
and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by
(433,6)tapering upright con(160,6)congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is
art; which in many a district of(479,13)has superinduced bright
terrac(280,6)(876,6)s(1016,10)barren refuse rocks thrown aside at
creation’s final day.

And the women(141,15)(901,7)bloom(808,8)eir own red roses. But
roses onl(47,8)i(522,8); whereas the(495,6)carna(791,7)(790,7)cheeks
is perennial as sunlight i(233,6)seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that
(177,6)(92,8)s, ye cannot, save in Salem,(156,6)(991,6)tell me the young
girls breathe such musk,(970,7)sailor(728,6)hearts smell them miles off
shore, as though(930,6)were drawing ni(23,6) odorous Moluccas instead of
the Puritanic sands.


CHAPTER 7. The Chapel(908,6)this same(611,13)there stands a Whaleman’s(60,7), and few are
the moody fishermen, shortly bound fo(826,6)Indian Ocean or Pacific, who
fail to make a Sunday visit to(478,6)pot. I am sure that I did not.

Returning from my first mo(22,6)stroll, I again sallied out(813,8)is
special errand(310,6)sky had changed(96,6)clear, sunny cold, to driving
sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket(752,7) cloth called
bearskin, I fought my way(197,6)st(762,6)tubborn storm. Entering(54,7)nd
a small scattered congreg(875,9)(689,6)s(480,6)(13,7)’ wives and
widows. A muffled silence reigned,(994,7)roken at times by(925,6)hrieks
(229,7)(169,8)ach(72,6)t worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart
from(785,6)ther, as if e(76,11)grief(838,6)insular and
incommunicable(787,6)chaplain had not yet arrived; an(787,8)these
(172,7)islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble
tablets, with black borders, masoned in(762,7)wall on either side the
pulpit. Three(574,7)m ran something like the following, but I do not
pretend to quote:—

SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, a(640,6)age of eighteen, was
lost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, _November_
1_st_, 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.(207,26)ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,
WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming on(405,8) boats’
crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who(684,6)towed out of sight by a Whale, On the
Off-shore Ground in the PACIFIC, _Dec(318,6) 3(319,10)9(319,7)MARBLE
Is here placed(935,7)ir surviving SHIPMATES(324,27)The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who(159,8)bows
of his boat was kill(126,6)a Sperm(236,6) o(211,6)coast of Japan, _August_
3_d(533,6)3(533,46)WIDOW.

Shaking of(418,6)sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated
myself n(726,8)door, and turning sideways was surpris(685,6)see
Queequeg(66,6)me. Aff(719,6)(396,6) solemnity(583,8)scene, there was a
wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage
was the only person present who seem(873,6)notice my entrance; because
h(151,6)(73,9)one who could not read, and(199,7)fore, was(30,9)ing
those frigid inscriptions(536,8)wall. Whether an(291,9)relatives of
the seamen whose names appeared(329,8)ere now among(631,7)ngregation,
I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents(916,8)fishery,
and so plainly did several wome(366,11)(593,8)(428,11) if not
the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure(17,6)here
before m(247,7)assembled those, i(299,8)unhealing heart(542,6)sight(346,6)ose bleak tablets sympathetically caus(357,6) old wounds to bleed
afresh.

Oh! ye(418,7)dead lie buried beneath the green grass;(661,6)tanding
(442,6)flowers can say—here, _here_ lies my beloved; ye know not the
desolation(320,6)broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in(278,9)ack-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!(73,6)despair(67,10)immovable(765,13)(46,9)adly voids and unbidden
infidelitie(641,9)lines(530,6)seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse
resurrec(882,6)to the beings who have placelessly perished without a
grave. As well might(612,6)(560,10)tand(808,8)cave of Elephanta as
here.

In what census of living creatures, th(572,7)of mankind are included;
why it i(269,7)a universal proverb says of them(838,7)they tell no
tal(108,6)ough containing more secrets tha(1020,6)Goodwin Sands; how(129,6)
(90,6)o his name who yesterday departed for(831,6)ther world, we prefix
so significant (334,6)fidel a word(470,6)yet do(744,7)us entitle him, if
he but embarks(117,9)remotest Indie(280,7)is(380,8)earth; why the
Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures(638,6)immortals; i(483,6)
eternal, unstirring paralysis(677,6)(767,6), hopeless trance, yet lies
antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago(410,11)(1018,6)we

dwelling in unspeakable bliss(318,6)all(937,7)ving so strive to hush all
(735,8); wherefor(437,6)the rumor of a knock(111,7)a tomb will terrify
a whole city. A(122,6)se things are not(967,9)their meanings.

But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tomb(433,7)even from(109,6)
dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.

It needs scarcely(399,7)told, with what feelings, o(894,6)eve of a
Nantucket voyage, I regarded(456,7)marble tablet(616,7)by the murky
light(771,6)at darkened, doleful day read the fate(815,6)e whalemen who
had gone b(450,6)me. Yes, Ishmael, the sam(68,7)may b(414,6)e. But
somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to(987,7), fine
chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat(578,6)make me an
(951,8) by brevet(198,7)there is(1008,6) in this business of whaling—a
speechlessly quick chaotic bundling(724,6)man into Eternity. But what
then? Methinks we have hugely mistake(135,7)matter of Life and Death.
(64,9)(1022,6)hat they call my shadow here on earth is my true
substance.(139,10)that in looking at(869,8)spiritual, we are too
much(852,6)oysters observi(848,7)sun through(600,6)ater(864,6)thinking

of my better being. In fact take(57,9)who will,(23,6)it I say, it is
not me. And(539,6)fore three cheers for (927,9); and come(640,13)
and(655,9)dy when(416,6)(124,6)for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.


CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.

I had not been seated very long ere(648,7)of a certain venerable
robustness entered; immediately as(985,6)torm-pelted door flew back upon
admitting him, a(792,7)regardful eye(792,7)him by all the congregation,
sufficiently attested(734,6)this fine old man w(158,7)chaplain(973,7)it
(26,8)famous Father Mapple, so called by(659,6)halemen, among whom he
was a(335,6)great favourite. He had(376,6)a sailor and a harpooneer in
his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the
ministry. A(748,6)time I now write of,(228,14) was in the hardy
winter(519,6)healthy old age;(1011,6)sort of(22,8) which seems merging
into a second flowering(224,8)for(322,7)(478,8)fissures(505,6)s
wrinkles,(856,6) shone(664,9)mild gleams(689,6)newly developing
bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’s snow. No
one having previously hear(384,6)history, could for(207,7)rst time
behold(375,16)ithou(422,6)utmost interest, because(250,7)were
(913,8)engrafted clerical peculiarities about(860,6)imputabl(544,7)at
adventurous maritime(578,6)h(677,6)led. When he(1000,8) I observ(864,7)
he carried no umbrella, and(417,8)ly had not come in his(55,6)age, for
his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet(95,6)his(865,7)pilot
cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him(800,7) floor(92,6)the weight of
the water i(868,6)absorbed. However, hat(226,6)o(9,7)overshoes were one
by one removed(179,7)ung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;
when, arrayed(55,6)decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.

Like most old fashioned(33,7)s, it was a very lofty one(452,6)since a
regular stairs to such a h(313,6)would, by its long ang(733,7) the
floor, ser(824,7)contrac(760,6)already small area of the chapel, the
architect, i(484,8),(421,6)cted upon the hint of(873,14), and
finis(294,14)(898,9)a(224,7), substituting a perpendic(261,6)ide
ladder, like those us(421,6)moun(57,7)ship from a boat at sea. The wife
of a whaling captain had provid(463,7)(262,6)(780,6)a handsome pair of
red worsted man-ropes for this (172,8)which, being itself nicely
head(679,8)stained(110,8)mahogany colour,(817,6)hole(452,6)ivance,
considering what manner of(191,8)(619,6),(926,8)by no means in bad
taste. Ha(1007,6)for an instant a(557,6)foot(543,8)(391,8)an(176,7)both
hands grasping the ornamental knobs(608,8)(303,9),(558,14)
cast a look upwards(966,6)then(394,8)truly sailor-like but still
reverential dexterity, hand over hand,(558,6)(950,7)steps as if
ascend(191,8)main-top of his vessel.

The(671,15)part(223,7)is sid(294,11)s is usually(863,6)ase
with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, on(62,7)rounds(44,8)
wood, so th(747,6)every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of
(921,10), it had not escaped me(95,6)however convenient(559,6) ship,
these(106,6)s in(1007,6)resent(592,7)ce(649,8)unnecessary. For I was not
prepared to see(548,14) after gain(615,8)height, slowly turn
roun(859,9)ooping(513,6)(234,12)deliberately drag up(738,11)
step b(333,6), till(904,11)was deposit(952,7)in, leaving him
impregnable in his little Quebec.

I pondered some time without fully compreh(664,11)reason for this.
(289,14)enjoyed such a wide reputati(55,7)sincerity and
sanctity,(580,6)I coul(513,6)suspect him of courting notoriety by any
mere trick(998,9)stage. No, thought I,(660,7)must be(245,6)sober
(214,15) thing; furthermore, it(58,6)symboliz(65,6)thing unseen.
Can it be, then(213,7)by(801,7)ct of physical isolation, he signifies
his spiritual withdrawal(374,7)(426,6), from all outward worldly ties
and connexions? Yes, for replenish(570,7) the meat and wine(325,7)
word, to the faithful man of God,(301,6)(956,8)I see, is a
self-cont(811,7)stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein,(141,6)a perennial
well of water(742,7)(773,6)alls.

But(494,6)id(824,8)(969,8) the only strange featur(221,8) place,
borrowed(334,6)the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Betwee(136,6)marble
cenotaphs on either hand(107,9)(1011,7)(187,8) which(94,6)d its back
was adorn(409,8)a large painting represe(13,6)a gallant ship beating
against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
breakers. But high above(519,6)lying scud and dark-rolling clouds(872,7)
floated a little isle of sunlight(707,7)(270,6)beamed forth an angel’s
face; and(922,6)bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
ship’s tossed deck,(958,11)like(938,6)silver plate now inserted into
the Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the(209,6)
seemed to say, “beat on, (9,9)thou(62,12) and bear a hardy
helm; for lo!(769,6)un is breaking through;(721,6)louds are (425,7)
off—serenest azure is at hand.”

No(842,6)(703,10) itself without a trac(847,9)same sea-tast(334,6)
had achieved th(931,9)(461,6)e picture. Its panell(905,6)nt was (1006,6)
likeness of a (459,7)bluff bows(289,6)the Holy Bible rested on a
projecting pie(179,6)scroll work, fashioned after(101,10)fiddle-headed
beak.

What could be more full of meaning?—for(315,13)s ever(706,6)earth’s
foremost part; all th(186,6) comes in its rear(458,6)(394,7)leads the
world. From thence (111,6)th(1015,10) God’s quick wrath is first
descried(325,10)bow must(627,6)the earliest brunt(110,19)
the God of breezes fair or foul(111,9) invok(998,6) favourable winds.
Yes, the world’s(494,7) o(264,6)passage out(789,6)not a voyage complete;
(607,9)(381,9)its prow.


CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.

Father Mapple rose(890,6)in a mild voi(752,6)unassuming authority ordered
the scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away
to l(38,7)—(9,8)(47,8) to s(68,8)! Midships! m(10,8)”

There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among(510,6)enche(852,7)a
still slighter shuff(69,8)women’s sho(49,9)ll was quiet again, and
every eye on(1019,6)reacher.

He paused a little; then kneeling i(52,7)ulpit’s(1014,7)folded his
large brown hands across his chest, uplift(49,6) closed ey(235,7)
offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed(157,10)and praying
at(835,7)ttom of(903,6)ea.

This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tol(440,8)a
bell(659,6)ship(149,6)is foundering at sea(695,6)fog—in such(97,6) he
commenced readi(505,7)following hymn; but changing his manner toward(1011,6)concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—


  “The ribs and terrors(501,8)whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,
  While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down
  to doom.

  “I saw the o(38,7)maw(831,6)ll, With endless pain(192,6)sorrows(978,6);(154,6)ch none but they(589,6)feel can tell— Oh, I was plu(376,6)to

  Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God(437,6)My song for ever shall record That terrible,(980,6)joyful hour; I

Nearly all joined in si(467,7)his hymn, which swelled high abo(124,6)
how(1014,8)the storm. A brief pause ensued;(129,6)reacher slowly turned
over the leaves(79,8)B(256,6)and at last, fold(1005,8)hand down upon
(97,6)oper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch(115,6)ast verse(198,7)

would have us do are(63,6)for us to do—remember that—and hence, he
oftener(163,8)s us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we

He said no more(575,6)slowly waving a benediction, covered(333,6)ace with
his hand(803,7)so remained kneeling, till(593,8) people had departed,
and he was left alone(917,7) place.


CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.

Return(525,7)the Spouter-Inn (639,7)e Chapel, I found Queequeg there
quite(126,6); he h(267,6)lef(861,6)(63,6) bef(477,6)e(292,12) some
time. H(205,6)sitting on(335,6)ch(60,12)fire,(675,11)eet on the
stove hearth(966,7)n one hand was holding close up(959,6)(412,7)that
little negro idol(516,7); peering hard into it(470,6)(455,6)with a
jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile hum(918,7)
himself in his heathenish way.

But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going
(499,7)table, took up a large book(481,6)(678,6)placing it o(152,6)lap
began counting(684,6)ages(417,6)deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth
page—as I fancied—stopp(850,6)moment, looking vacantly around him, and
giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He
would then begin again a(717,6)next fifty; see(435,7) commence at number
one each time, as though he could not(315,6) m(794,6)an(91,6)(701,7)t was
only by such(414,9)(100,6) of(324,7)s(529,7)(929,6)together, that his
(231,12)(204,8)multitude of(439,8)as excited.

With much(613,6)est I sat watching him. Savage(223,11)was(402,6)hideously marred abou(329,6)face—at least to my taste—his(594,6)enance
yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You
cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I(439,7)t I
saw(819,6)races of a simple honest heart(882,6)(958,7)large, deep eyes,
fiery black and bold,(875,6) seemed token(97,8)pirit(458,6)(668,6)dare a
thousand devils. And besides all this(89,8)was a certain lofty
bearing(405,11)Pagan,(344,7)eve(1001,6)uncouthness(698,10)
al(615,8) maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed an(18,7)
had(477,7)creditor. Wh(87,6)(769,6), too(714,10) head(750,7)shaved,
his forehead was (1007,6)out in freer(362,6)righter relief(871,6)(180,6)
more expansiv(909,7)it otherwise(380,6), this I will not venture to
decide; but(362,9)(965,6)(185,10)was phrenologically an excellent
one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington’s
head, as seen in the popular busts of(960,6)I(864,6)the same long
regularly graded retreating slope from abov(853,6)brows(572,8)were
likewise very projecting,(545,6)two long promontories thickly wooded on
top. Queequeg was George(240,11) cannibalist(341,7)developed.

Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
looking out a(818,6)storm(267,6)the casement, he(756,7)heeded my
presence,(782,7)troubled himself with so much as a single glanc(602,6)
appeared wholly occupied(62,6)counting(495,6)ages of the marvellous
book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping (1005,9)the night
previous(840,6)especially c(90,11)the affectionate arm I had found
thrown over me upon waking(694,8)morning, I thought(902,6)indifference
of his(619,6)strange. But savages are(25,8) beings; at times you do
not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their
calm self-collectedness of simplicit(989,6)s a Socratic wisdom.(285,6)
noticed also that(771,10)(600,6)consorted at all, or but(878,6)little,
with the other seamen(345,8)inn. He made no advances whatever;(622,10)to have no desire to enlarg(1024,6)circle (392,7)acquaintances.
All(436,6)struck me as mighty singular; yet,(514,6)second(496,8)s, there
was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand
miles(951,6)home, by the way of Cape Horn,(379,6)is—which was(334,6)nly
way he could get(164,6)—(721,7)among people as(636,9)to him as(717,7)
he were(750,8)planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;
preserv(1020,8)ut(284,6)erenity; content with his own companionship;
always equal(169,7)self. Surely(887,6)(347,6)touch of fine philosophy;
(932,6) no doubt he had(694,7)heard(461,6) was such a (464,7)s that. But,
perhaps, to be tru(104,11)ers, we mortals should not be conscious of
so living or so striving. So soon as I hear(873,6)such or(156,8)man
gives(271,8) out for a(144,12), I conclude that, like the
dyspeptic old woman, he must(855,6)“broken his digester.”

As I sa(604,7)(953,6)at now lonely room; the fire burning low,(47,8)
mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then
only glows(404,7)looked at(129,6)evening shades and phantoms gathering
roun(93,6)casements,(44,6)eering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the
storm booming without in solemn swells; I began(583,7)sensible of
(915,8)feelings. I felt a melt(140,7)me. No more my splintered heart
and maddened hand(975,6)turned against the wolfish world. This soothing
savag(811,6)red(1002,6)it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a
natu(553,6)which(875,7)lurked no civilized hypocrisi(427,7)bland
deceits. Wild he was; a(117,6)sight of(9,6)s to see; yet(359,11)
feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things(694,6)would(799,6)repelled most ot(1024,6)they(365,7)he(279,6)magnet(65,6) thus
drew me. I’ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness
has proved but hollow courtesy. I (104,6)y bench near him(730,6)made some
(116,6)ly sign(803,6)hints, doing(65,6)st to talk with him meanwhile. At
(950,6)he little notic(947,6)se advances; but presently,(855,6)my
referring to his last night’s hospitalities, he(192,6)out to ask me
whether we(751,6)agai(868,8)bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I
(375,8)he looked pleased, perhaps a(224,8)complimented.

We then(868,8)over the book together(379,6)I endeavored to expl(170,6)
him the purpose of(15,6)rinting(443,6)the meaning(33,8)few pictures
that(1009,6)in(944,7)us I soon engaged his interest; and from(677,6)we
went to jabbe(407,6)he(520,6)we could about(744,6)arious outer(906,10)
be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,
producing his pouch(260,6)omahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And
then we sat exchanging puffs(246,12)ild pipe of his(808,6)keeping it
regularly passing between us.

If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me(284,6)e Pagan’s
breast,(304,6)pleasant, gen(283,9) we had,(465,6)thawed it out, and
left us cronies. He seem(623,6)take to me quite as naturally and
unbiddenly as I(914,6)m(550,6)when our(139,8)as over, he press(604,6)
forehead(902,6)st mine, clasp(419,6)rou(717,7)wais(187,6) said that
henceforth(977,9)married;(766,8), in his country’s phrase,(712,11)re bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a
(98,7)man(411,7)sudden flame of(94,8)hip(93,7)hav(374,9)far too
premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but(822,9)simple savage
those old rules(203,7)not apply.

After supper(709,6)another(865,8)chat(366,6)moke,(352,6)(1008,6)our room
together. He made(854,7)resent(803,7) embalmed head; took out his
enor(1007,7)bacco walle(488,7)groping under the(38,8), drew out some
thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them o(845,6)table(780,6)mechanically divi(45,10)into two equal portions, pushed one of them
(945,10)(680,11)it was mine. I was go(469,7)remonstrate(462,6)he
silenc(766,6)by pour(141,14)my trowsers’ pockets. I let(224,6)stay.
He(253,6)went ab(369,7) evening prayers,(399,13) idol(868,6)removed
the paper fireboard. By certain signs(918,6)ymptoms, I thought h(734,8)
anxious(836,7) to join him(712,6)well knowing wha(310,6)to follow, I
deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I(967,7)comply or
otherwise.

(400,6)a good Christian; born and bred(868,6)e bosom(493,7) infallible
Presbyterian Church. How(637,6)could I unite with(945,6)wild idolator in
worshipping his piece of wood? But(280,6)is (43,7)?(360,9)I. Do you
suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
earth—paga(468,7)all included—can possibly be jealous of an
insignificant bit of black(193,7)Im(61,7)e!(205,21)—to do
the will of God—_that_(246,11). And(267,9)(47,15)(70,9)o my fellow man(595,6)(525,8)have(32,15)to do to me(115,10)(141,16). Now, Queequeg is(102,14)(155,11)do I wish
(380,7)is(56,10)(659,6)(112,8)? Why,(545,12)me in my particular(614,14)form(539,6)(275,7)Consequently, I must(1024,6)(632,11)him
in his; ergo(41,10)urn(652,9). So I kindled the shavings; helped
prop up(778,7)nocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with
(323,8); salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that
done, we undressed and went to bed, at peac(893,7)our own consciences
(747,8)the world.(879,6)e did not go to sleep without some(245,8)chat.

How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
disclosures between friends. Man(229,6)ife, they say,(99,7)open the
very bottom of their souls to each other(334,6)some old couples often
lie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our
hearts’ honeymoon, lay I and(844,9)—a cosy, loving pair.


CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.

We had lain thus in(494,6)chatting and napping at short intervals, and(647,9) now(597,7)en affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
over mine,(68,10)drawing them back; so entirely sociabl(349,6)free
and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of ou(562,6)abulations, what
(901,7)nappishness remained in us altogether departed(184,6)we felt like
ge(326,6)up again, though day-break was ye(776,7)way down the future.

Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position
began to grow wearisom(364,7)by(898,8)and(909,8)we found ourselves
si(207,8); the clothes well tucked around us, leaning(251,6)st the
head-board with our four knees drawn up close (356,8)(531,6)our two
noses bending(848,6)them, as i(470,6)kneepans(520,7)arming-pans. W(418,6)(987,6)nic(924,6)snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;
indeed(21,8)bed-(277,8)too, see(704,6)at th(140,6)s no fire in the
room. T(123,10), I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some
small part of you must be cold, for(130,7)is no quality(132,6)is world
that(33,6)t what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If
you flatter y(577,6)f(672,6)you are all(443,6)comfortabl(1018,7)have been
so a long time, then you cannot be said to(232,6)(73,9) any more. But
if, like Queequeg and m(385,8) bed(507,6)tip(318,7)r nose (309,6) crown
(26,8)head be slightly(538,6)ed, why then, (536,6),(98,8)general
consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakab(493,7). For
this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnishe(883,7)a fire,
which is one of the luxurious dis(410,7)s(29,8)rich. F(276,7)height
of(576,6)so(634,6)deli(226,10)is to(466,6)n(560,7)but(373,6)lanket
betwe(472,7)and(381,6)snugness and(386,6)old(165,8)outer air. Then(857,6)
you lie(489,6)the on(1018,6) spark(492,8)he(803,7)an arctic crystal.

We had been sitting(801,9)crouching manner for some(669,7)when all at
once I thought I would open my eyes; for(53,6)(258,8)sheets, whether
by day or by night(801,6)(32,7) asleep or awake, I(828,6)a way of always
k(546,7)(122,7) shut, in orde(737,6)more to concentrat(324,6)(392,9)of
be(271,7)bed. Because no man can ever(720,6)his own identity aright
except his(138,6)be closed; as if darkness were(837,7) the proper
element of our essences,(363,7) light b(209,7)congenial to our clayey
part. Upon open(284,12)(958,6)and coming out of my own pleasant and
self-created(186,10)into the imposed(77,7)ars(698,8)gloom(882,7)
unilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-(504,7)I experienced a disagreeable
revulsion. Nor did I at all object (148,7)hint from Queequeg that
perhaps it(378,6)best to strike a(345,6), seein(52,6) we(422,6)so wide
awake; and besides he felt a strong desi(618,6)(682,7)few quiet puffs
from his Tomahawk. Be it said,(121,6)(492,7)I had(96,6)such(101,9)
repugnanc(105,6)is smok(972,9)e b(597,7)n(558,7)fore, yet see how
elastic our stiff prejudices grow(1007,6)love once comes to bend them.
For now I liked nothing better than(266,9)(399,9)(171,8)by me,
even(884,7), b(884,7)he seemed(113,6) full of(263,6)serene household joy
then. I no(1003,6)felt unduly(1012,6)rned for the landlord’s policy of
insurance. I was only alive(606,8)condensed conf(1021,6)al
comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.
With(398,6)haggy jackets drawn about(31,7)oulders, we now pass(496,6)
(596,8)(770,6)on(185,9)other, till slowly there grew over us a blue
hanging tester of smoke, (969,12)by the flame(1003,7) new-lit lamp.

Whether it was(731,8)is(408,6)at(100,11)roll(692,7)savage away to
far distant scenes, I know not, but h(265,6)spoke of his native island;
and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He
gladly complied. T(938,6)at the time I but ill comprehend(796,6) a few of
his words(917,7)ubsequent disclosures,(899,6)I had become(732,7)amiliar
with his broken phraseology, now enable me to presen(170,6)whole story
such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.


CHAPTER 12. Biographical.

(1001,9)was a(392,8)of Rokovoko, an(408,7) far(490,8) the West and
South. It is not down in any map; true places never are(630,6)n a new-hatched(595,8)running wild(850,7)(554,11)woodlands in a
grass clout, follow(758,10)nibbling goats, as if he were a green
sapling; even then, in (289,8)’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong
desire to see something(519,6)of Christendom than a specimen whaler or
two. His father(409,7)High Chief, a King; (925,6)cle(32,8)Priest; and
o(531,7)aternal side he boasted aunts who(262,6)the wives of
unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal
stuff; t(884,6)sadly vitiated, I fear,(419,8)cannibal propensity he
nourishe(97,9)untutored youth.

A Sag Harbor ship visited h(324,9)’s bay, and(464,9) sought a
passage to(418,7)ian lands. Bu(898,6)ship, having her full complement of
seamen, spurn(128,7)sui(400,6) not all the King(159,14)influence
could prevail(129,6)(932,9)vowed a vow. Alone(377,8)canoe, he paddled
off to a distant strait, which he knew(221,9) must pass through when
she quitted the island. On one(598,6)(674,6)coral reef; (637,7)other a
low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into
the water. Hid(323,8)(250,7)still afloat, among thes(83,10), with
its prow seaward, he sat down i(822,6)stern,(332,7) low in hand(860,6)whe(40,7)hip was gl(146,6)by, like a flash he darted out; gained her
side;(255,6)one backward dash of(703,6)oot capsized and sank(498,10);
climbed up(840,6)hains(626,6)throw(618,6)mself at(695,6)length up(423,6)
deck, grappled a ring-bolt there(825,6)swore not to let it go,(993,7)
hack(936,6)pieces.

In va(338,7)capt(12,6)reatened to(163,6) him overboard; suspended a
cutlass over his naked wrists;(973,10)was(936,6)on of a King, and
(1009,9)budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness(248,6)his
wild desire to visit Christendom,(228,13)at last relented(136,6)told him he might make(413,12)home(1010,6)this fine young savage—this
sea Prince of Wales, never sa(977,6)C(365,6)’s cabin. They put him down
(802,9) sailor(237,7)made a whaleman(648,6)m(149,6)like Czar Peter
content to toil(828,9)hipyards of foreign cities,(433,10)disdained
no seeming ignominy, if(635,6)by(303,10)happily g(596,8)power of
enlighten(750,6)s untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he
was actuated by a profoun(507,12)learn (318,10)(517,6)ians, the
arts w(187,7)to(484,8)s people still(203,6)er than they were(951,6)more
(25,7)at,(50,7)bett(49,17). But, alas!(274,6)ractices of
(453,6)en soon convince(644,6)that even(193,11) could be both
miserable and wicked; infinitely more so,(198,6)all his father’s
heathens. Arrived(792,9)in old Sag Harbor(249,6)seeing what the
(665,7) did(525,6)(288,6)then going on to Nantucket(944,6)(71,7)how they
spent their wages in _that_ place also, poor(672,10)gave it up for
lost. Thought he, it’s a(280,7) world i(263,6)meridians; I’ll die a
pagan.

And thus a(263,6)idolat(667,6)heart, he yet l(310,6)(938,8)s(622,13)
wore(215,7)clothe(963,7)tried to talk(248,7)gibberish. Hence the queer
ways about him, though now some time from home.

By hints, I ask(593,7)whether he did not propose(428,7)back(417,6)having
a coronation; since(1004,10)now consider(599,11) dead and gone, he
being very ol(28,6)feeble (583,6)(627,6)accounts. He answered no, not
yet(892,6)added(797,6)he was fearful(1000,10)ity, or r(145,6)(402,12)had unfitt(870,7)for ascendi(451,6) pur(848,6)undefiled throne of thirty(553,6) Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,—as
soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he
(447,7)d to sail(549,6)(868,7)ow his wild oats(763,8)four oceans. They
had made a harpooneer of(622,6)(977,6)at barbed iron was in lieu of a
sceptre now.

(631,14)at(563,7)be his immediate purpose, touching(585,6)uture
moveme(530,16), to go to sea(293,6), in his old vocation. Upon
this, I tol(775,6)that whaling was my own design(929,6)inform(824,7)of my
intention(365,9)out of Nantucket, as (748,6)the most promising port
for an adventurous whaleman to embark from(774,6)t once resolved to
accompany me to(778,6)island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the
same watch,(42,10)boat(15,11)mess with me, in short to share my
every hap;(41,6)both my hands(406,7), boldly dip(129,9) Potluck of
both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection
I now(845,6)for Queequeg(895,6)as an experienced(748,11)(818,6)as such,
could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was
wholly ignorant of(532,6)ysteries of(644,8), though well acquainted
with(454,6)ea, as known to merchant seamen.

His story(641,7)ended(444,6)his pipe’s last dying puff,(291,9)
embraced me, pressed(908,6)orehead(873,6)st mine(805,6)blowing out the
light, we rolled over from each other,(474,6)way and that(883,6)very soon
were sleeping.


CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.

Next morning, Monday, after disposing(381,8)embalmed head to a barber,(920,6) block, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my
(35,10)money. The grinning landlord, as(491,7)(704,6)boarders, seemed
amazingly tickled at(974,6)udden friendship which had sprung up between
me and(774,9)—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock(469,6)ull stories
about him had previ(910,6)so much alarmed me concerning the(463,6)person
whom (925,6)compani(668,7).

We borrowed a w(478,10)(916,6)embark(614,6)r things, including(418,7)
poor carpet-bag(976,6)(1024,8)’s canvas sa(230,7)hammock, away we went
d(863,7)“the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moor(423,9)
wharf. As(89,6)re going alo(285,7)people stared; not at(909,9) so
much—for they(69,6)used to seeing cannibals like him in their
streets,—but at(51,8)him and me upon such confidential terms. But we
heeded them not,(200,13)wheel(494,8)(913,6) by turns(384,14)
now(1005,7)en stopping to adjus(732,7)heath on his harpoon barbs. I
asked him why he carried(196,6)a troublesome(550,6) with(242,6)shore, and
whether all whaling ships did not fi(169,6)ir own(137,8)s. To this, in
substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet
he had a particular affection for his(134,12), because it was of
assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat(856,6)deeply intimate
with the hearts of whales. In short,(617,6)many inland reapers and
mowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows arm(1023,7)(360,10)
scythes—(318,7)in no wise oblig(762,6)furnish them—even so,(999,9),
(307,12)private reasons, preferred(342,16).

Shift(716,15)from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
the first(798,6)(790,7)(488,7)ever seen. I(447,6)in Sag Harbor. The
owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his
heavy chest(187,7) boarding house. Not to seem ignorant(198,6) the
thing(398,11)truth he was entirely so, concern(318,8)precise way in
(157,9)manage(353,11)—(440,8) puts his(177,7)upon it; lashes it
fast; a(922,6)n shoulders(432,12)and marches up the wharf. “Why,”
said I, “(561,9) you might have known better than that, one would
think. Didn’t(240,6)eople laugh?”

Upon t(557,17)nother(557,6). T(57,10)(490,7)island of
Rokovoko(504,12)at(811,7)wedding feasts expres(263,6)fragrant water
of young cocoanuts(915,6)a large stained calabash(989,6)a punchbowl; and
this(20,10) always form(381,6)great central ornament on(843,6)raided
mat wher(512,6)feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once
touched at (291,10)and its commander—from all accounts, a very
stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this
(99,9)(955,7)vited to(618,6)(408,12) of (733,8)’s sister, a
pretty(408,7)princess just turned of ten. Well; when all(99,12)
guests were assembl(278,6)(369,6)ide’s bamboo cottage, this C(207,6)
(806,8)in(321,6)being assigned(966,6)o(199,6)honor, placed himself over
agains(773,7)(565,8)(81,8)twee(515,6)High Priest and his majesty the
King,(303,12)father. Grace(156,7)said,—for thos(885,9)have(793,6)
grace as well(8,6)—though(395,9)(909,9)that unlike us, who at such
times look downwards to our platters, they,(741,8)contrary, copying
the ducks, glance up(74,9)(822,10)Giver of all(978,7)—Grace, I
say,(254,12)(333,17)open(1018,6)banquet by the immemorial
ceremony of(27,6)sland;(258,6)is, dipping his consecrated and
(16,9)ing fingers in(754,7)bowl befo(981,7)blessed beverage

precedence over a mer(268,8) (640,6)especially i(696,6)King’s own
house—the(109,9)coolly procee(545,6)wash his hands(70,7)
(793,9);—taking it I suppose for a huge(353,7)-glass. “Now,” said
(796,8), “what you tink now?—Didn’t(672,6)(790,6)laugh?”

At last, passage paid(1011,6)luggage safe, we stood on board the
schooner. Hoist(904,7)l, it glided dow(998,6)Acushnet river. On one
side, New Bedford rose in terraces of street(855,6)ir ice-covered trees
all glittering(418,8)clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of
casks on (9,6)were piled upon her wharves(647,6)side by(8,6)the
world-wand(133,6)whale ships lay silent(60,6)afely moored a(390,6); while
from others came a sound of carpenter(193,6)coopers, with blended noises
of fire(235,6)forges to mel(852,6)pitch, all betoken(855,6)at new cruises
were o(755,6)start;(36,6)one most perilou(339,6)long voyage ended, only
begins a second; and(14,9)(42,12) (42,9)thir(653,7)so on,
for ever(210,8) aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness
of all earthly effort.

Gai(260,7)e more open water(73,6)bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his
snortings. How I snuffed(411,6)Tartar air!—h(31,6)purn(31,8)turnpike
earth!—that common highway all over dented(573,6)the mark(880,6)lavish
hee(811,7)hoofs(438,6)t(111,6)me to admire(62,7)gnanimity of(560,6)ea
which will permit no records.

A(653,6)same foam-f(917,7), Queequeg seemed to drink and reel(759,6)me.
His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed
teeth. On, on we flew(679,6)our offing gained(598,6)Moss did homage to
the b(972,6)duck(99,7)dived(501,9)(500,6)slave befo(318,7)Sultan.
Sideways leaning, we s(21,8)darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
wire(658,6)two tall masts buck(41,10)Indian canes in land tornadoes.
So full(462,6)is reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging
bowsprit,(702,6)for some time we did not notic(584,6)jeering glances of
the passengers, a lubber-(240,6)ssembly, who marv(506,6)(785,6)wo fellow
beings should be so companionable; as though a white man(234,6)anything
more dignifi(918,6)n(46,8)washed negro. But th(294,6)re(248,6)boobies
and bumpkins(37,6), who,(321,7)ir intense greenness, must have come
from the heart and centre of all verdure.(842,10)caught one(931,7)se
young saplings mimicking him behin(820,6)back. I(289,7)(951,6)(195,7)’s
h(806,6) doom was come. Dropp(77,6)s harpoon(831,6)brawny savage(153,7)
him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,
sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly ta(167,10)stern
in mid-somerset(1012,6)(586,6) landed with bursting lungs upo(192,6)feet,
while(384,9), turn(271,8)back(48,8)m, lighte(364,6)tomahawk pipe

“Capting! (9,8)” y(773,8)(422,9), running towards(916,6)officer;(70,9),(70,8), here’s the devil.”

“Hallo, _you_ sir,” cr(779,6)e Captain, a gaunt rib(620,7) sea, stalking
up to(283,11)“what in thunder do you mean(791,6)at? Don’t you know
you migh(792,7)ki(1018,10)chap?”

“Wha(528,6)say?” said(402,11)as he mildly turned(355,6).

“He say,(53,7)I, “tha(127,6)came near kill-e(333,6)man(975,7)” pointing
(631,7)still shivering(986,6)horn.

“Kill-e(331,9)(562,11)wi(608,6)his tattooed face(721,6)an unearthly
expression of disdain, “ah!(975,7)vy small-e fish-e;(670,9) no(204,7)

“Look you,” roar(525,16)“I’ll(297,8)_you_,(325,7)nnibal, if
you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind(33,6)eye.”

But it so happened just then,(749,6)it was high ti(840,7)(696,11) to
min(902,6)own eye. The prodigious strain(1003,6)the main-sail had parted
the weather-sheet, an(912,6)tremendous boom was now flying from side to
side, completely sweeping the entire after part(875,8)deck(184,7)oor
fellow whom(495,10)had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all
hands were in a panic;(215,6)o attempt snatching at the(228,6)to stay it,

one ticking of a watch(358,6)every instant (112,7)(430,7)point of
snapping(840,6)splinters. Nothing was done(442,6)n(22,7)(190,7)capable
of being done; those on deck rushed towards(270,7)ws(523,6)stood eyeing
(297,9)as if it(360,6)the lower jaw of an exasperated(898,6). In the

only asked for water—fresh(12,7)something to wipe the brine off; that
done, he put on dry clothes, light(362,8)ip(584,7)leaning(584,6)st the

CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.

No(305,6)more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a
fine run, we safely arrived in(115,14)(127,8)! Take out your map(366,6)ook at it. See what a real corner of
the(283,6) it occupies; how it stand(699,7), away off shore,(238,6)lonely

extravaganzas only show(771,6)(577,10)is no Illinois.

Look now (810,6) wondrous traditional story of (82,6)is(260,7) was
settled(269,8)red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden (244,6)an eagle
swooped down upon the New England coast(400,6)(771,8)off an infant
Indian in his talons. With loud lamen(230,6)parents saw(755,7)child
borne out of sight ov(764,7)wide waters. They resolved to follow in the
same direction. Setting out(35,7)ir canoes, after a perilous passage
they discovered the(637,7)(663,6)(971,6)they(569,8)n empty ivory
casket,—the poor little (297,6)’s skeleton.

What wonder, the(720,9)hese(577,10)ers, born on a beach, should
take(688,8)sea for a livelihood!(311,6)first caught crab(801,6)quohogs

And thus have(766,7)naked(772,15)(792,6)sea hermits, issuing from

so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,

CHAPTER 15. Chowder.

It was quite late(543,8)evening(425,6)the little Moss came snugly to
anchor(190,6)Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no
(798,8)(540,6)day, at least none but a supper and a bed. T(467,8)ord
of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us(342,8)cousin Hosea Hussey (65,6)
Try Pots, whom he asserted to be(831,7)oprietor of one(62,7) best kept
hotels in all(527,10)(486,6)moreover he had assur(162,7)hat Cousin
Ho(965,8)he called him, was famous for(211,6)(470,6)s. In short, he
plainly hinted(895,7)(391,8)not possibly do better(853,7)ry pot-luck
a(966,6)(284,8). Bu(984,6)directions(203,8)given us about keeping a
yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to

corner three points to the(147,10)(96,8)at done,(107,6)ask the first
man we met wher(545,7)lace was: these crooked(305,12)of his very

insis(482,9)the (368,16)—our(179,6)(238,6) of departure—must be
lef(319,22),(222,6)as I had understood Peter Coffin to say
it was(393,8)(484,9). However, by d(135,7)beating(563,7)a little in
the dark(823,6)now(497,11)nocking up a peaceable inhabitant to
inqui(405,7)way, we at last came to something which there was no
mistaking.

Two enormous wooden pots pa(863,6)blac(172,7)suspended by asses’ ears,
swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in fro(440,6)an
old doorway. The hor(597,6)(85,16)were sawed off(796,8)other
side, so(567,8)is(126,13) l(694,6)no(407,11)like a gallows.
Perhaps I(498,6)ver sensitiv(351,6)uch impressions(708,8)time, but I
coul(103,6)help staring(750,6)is(108,8) with a vague misgiving. A sort
of crick was in my neck as I gazed up(997,8)two remaining(318,6); yes,
_two_(330,7)m, one for(876,9)(652,6)(22,8)me. It’s ominous, thinks
I. A(789,8)my Innkeeper upon landing(166,7)(919,6)whaling port;
tombstones(271,12)me i(926,6)whalemen’s chapel; and her(414,11)!
and a pair of prodigious(684,6)(703,6)too! A(806,6)se(797,6)throwing out
oblique hints touching Tophet?

(507,6)called(730,9)se reflections by the sigh(708,6) freckled woman
with yellow hair (187,6)(18,7)gown, st(312,10)the porch(757,8)inn,
under a dull red lamp swinging(988,6),(751,6)(733,7)much(725,7)n injured
eye(968,6)carrying on a brisk scolding(656,8)man in a purple woollen
shirt.

“Get alo(50,8)ye,” said she(656,8)man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”

“Come on,(648,10)(68,7)I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”

And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea(42,7) being(451,6)ho(928,8)leaving
(83,11) entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon
making known our desires for a suppe(505,8)bed,(198,12),
postponing further(395,10)for(530,6)resent, ushered us into a little
room(964,6)seating us at a table spread(476,6)the relics(691,6)recently
concluded repast,(343,8)rou(257,6)us(100,6)aid—“Clam or Cod?”

“What’s(647,6)about Cods, ma’am?(473,10)with(673,6)politeness.

(80,14) she repeated.

“A clam for(338,7)? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean(366,13)?”
says I, “but t(178,6)a rather(79,6)an(83,6)my reception(923,8)winter
time, ain’t it(99,16)
But(628,7)in a great hurry to resume(880,10)(808,7)(1022,9)urple
Shirt, who was wait(530,8)it(143,8)entry(503,8)eming to hear nothing

both on one clam?”

However, a warm savory steam(1010,6)(184,11) served to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when(737,6)smoking chowder
came in,(463,6)ystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!
hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than
hazel nuts, mixe(1014,7)pounded ship biscuit(571,7)alted pork cut up
into little flakes;(768,6)hole enrich(89,8)butter(646,6)plentifully

frosty voyage(745,6)in particular, (603,8) seeing his favourite fishing
food(460,8)him(819,6)the(447,8)(128,8)urpassingly excellent, we
despatched it(338,6)(984,6)expedition:(543,6)leaning back a moment and
bethinking me of(904,12)’s clam and cod announcement, I thought I
would try a(419,8)experiment. Stepping (948,14) door, I uttered
the word “cod”(210,13)mphasis(999,6)resumed my seat. In a few
(218,6)s the savou(889,9)came forth again, bu(309,7)a different
flavo(570,7)in good time a fine cod-(417,8)was place(456,9)us.

We(161,9)business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I
to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect o(74,6)head? What’s
that stultifying saying about(621,8)-headed people? “But look,
(718,8), ain’t that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s(19,6)harpoon?”

Fishiest of all fishy(318,6)s wa(434,6)Try Pots, which well deserved its
name; for the po(491,6)re were always boiling(841,8)s. C(851,7)for
breakfast(956,6)(878,8)for dinne(509,7)(24,12)supper, till you
began to look for fish-bones coming through(285,6)clothes. The area

polished necklace of codfish vertebra(632,6)Hosea(63,8)had his account

happening to take a stroll along(805,6)each among some fishermen’s
boats, I saw(246,6)’s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and
marching(112,11)san(401,7)each foot in a cod’s decapitated head,
looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.

Supper concluded, we received a lamp(672,6)directions from(523,12)
concer(307,6)he nearest way to bed; but, as (966,8)(450,6)bout to
precede me up(240,6)tairs, the lady reached forth her arm(155,7)emanded
his(1004,8); she allowed no(24,8) in her chambers. “Why not?” said I;
“every true whaleman sleeps(789,6)(105,11)—but w(67,9)“Because

“Both(499,8)I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of

CHAPTER 16. The Ship.

In bed we concocted our plans for the (171,6)(211,7)o my surprise and no
small (966,7),(932,10)now gave me to understand, that (387,7)been
diligently consulting Yojo—the nam(702,8) black little god—and Yojo
had told him two or(697,7)times over(1012,6)strongly insisted upon it
everyway(164,7)instead of our going together among th(1000,6)ing-fleet in
harbo(110,7)in(286,7)t selecting our craft;(101,12)this, I say,
Yojo earnestly enjoined(318,6)the(78,8)on(59,6)e ship should rest
wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order
to do so, had already pitch(317,8)a vessel, which, if lef(566,7)self,
I, Ishmael,(167,8)infallibly light upon, for all(349,6)orld as though
it had turned out by chance;(369,8)that(145,7) I must immediately ship
(150,7)(747,9)present irrespective of(722,9).

I(899,6)forgotten to mentio(115,6), in many things(783,11)placed great
confidence(173,6)e excellence of Yojo’s judgment(693,6)(888,6)ing forecast
(563,6)ng(433,6) cherishe(785,6)(503,6)considerable esteem, as a rather
good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough(811,6)(757,6)ole, but in
all cases did not succeed in(953,6)enevolent designs.

Now, this plan(366,12)’s, or(165,7)(273,7), touchi(886,7)(768,9)
(928,7)(849,7)I(131,9)like(970,6)plan at all. I ha(164,6)a little
reli(715,8)(131,10) sagacity to point ou(893,6)whaler best fitted to
carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances
produced no effec(785,6)(644,9), I was obliged to acquies(765,7)
accordingly prepar(39,6)set ab(190,6)is business(549,6)a determined
rushing(532,9)energy and vigor,(862,6)(961,7)quickly settl(365,6)
trifling(349,7) affair. Next morning early, leaving(809,10)shut up
with(712,6)in our(77,8)bedroom—for it seemed(1009,6)it was some(722,8)
Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with
(962,9)an(856,7)that day; _how_(119,8)I never could find out, for,
though I applied myself to(197,6)veral times,(74,15)master his
liturgie(608,6)XXXIX Articles—(330,16), then,(231,8) on his
tomahawk pipe(239,6)Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of
shavings, I sallied out amo(923,8)hipping. After much prolonged
saunterin(342,6)many random inquiri(263,6)learnt(962,6)there were three
ships up for(19,6)-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit(487,6)the
Pequod. _(41,6)Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _(68,7)_ is obvious;
_(73,6)_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated
tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct (72,7)ancient Medes. I
peered(709,7)yed(1012,9)(266,11); from her, hopped over to the
(291,7); and finally, go(580,7)board the (315,6), looked around her for
a momen(363,10)n decid(941,8)this(272,9)very shi(461,6)us.

You may have seen(551,6)a quaint craft in your day, for aught I
know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box
galliots(804,6)what not; but take my word for it(505,6)(953,6)saw such a
rare old(176,7)as(249,6)same (28,9)(645,8)She was a(268,6)of(636,6)ld
school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed
look(528,7)her. Long season(563,7)weather-stained in the typhoons and
calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a
French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her
venerable bows(648,8)bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere o(214,6)coast of
Japan, (29,6)her(1005,7)al ones were lost over(767,6)in a gale—h(101,8)
stood stiffly up(233,6)the spines(463,8)thre(531,6)kings of Cologne(214,6)(980,8)deck(126,7)worn(646,6)rinkled,(93,10)pilgrim-worshipped
flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral(237,7)Becket bled. But to all these
(464,8)antiquities,(270,6)added new and marvellous features, pertaining
to the wild business that for more than half a century she had
followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he
commanded another vessel of his own(997,6)now a retired seama(26,7)one
(911,7)principal owner(472,9)(965,6),—this(982,7)leg, during(841,6)erm
(117,7)(171,10)ship, had built upon(648,14)grotesqueness, and
inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,
unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or
bedstead. She was apparell(1004,9)ny barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his
neck heavy(197,6)pendants of polished ivory(104,11) (177,6)of
trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased
bo(935,7)her enem(82,6)ll round, her unpanelled, open bulwar(939,7)
garn(174,6)like one continuous jaw(422,7)the long sharp tee(425,6)the
sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to faste(556,7)ld hempen thews
and tendons to. Those(28,6) ran not through base blocks of land wood,
but deftly trav(470,6)over sheav(303,6)sea-(412,8)corning a turnstile
wheel at her reverend helm, she spo(226,11)a tiller; and that(17,7)
was in one mass, curiously(664,8)from(347,10)narrow lower jaw(475,7)
hereditary foe. The helmsman who steer(791,6)(128,11) in a tempest,
felt(737,6)the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery ste(877,6)clutching
its jaw. A noble(689,8)but somehow a most melancholy! All(48,7)things
are touched(609,8)at.

Now(148,6)I looked about the quarter-deck, for som(692,6)having
authority, in order to propose myself as a candidat(675,6)the voyage, at
first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of
tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It
seemed only(457,7)orary erection used in port. It was of a conical
shape,(296,6)ten feet high; consisting(968,7) long, huge slab(860,6)imber
black bone taken(698,10)middle and highest part(84,8)jaws(96,7)
right-whale. Plant(509,10)eir broad ends on the (490,6)a circle of
thes(159,8)laced together, mutually sloped towards each o(36,6)and at
the apex unit(325,6)a tufted point, wher(812,6)loose hairy fibres waved
to and fro(857,10)top-knot on(671,7)ld Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A
triangular opening f(220,7)(194,6)the bo(330,9) ship, so(1007,7)he
insider commanded a complete view forward.

And half conceal(581,6)this queer tenement, I at length found one who by
his aspect (683,7)to have (904,9); and who, it being noon(393,6)the
ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite(633,10)burden of
(244,7). He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all
over(654,6)curious carving(196,6)(387,6)ttom of which was formed of a
stout interlac(858,11)same elastic stuff(69,10)the wigwam was
constructed.

Ther(213,6)nothing so very particular, perhaps, about (733,6)pearanc(822,8) elderly man I saw; h(304,6)brown and brawny,(718,6)most old seamen,
and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut(596,6)e Quaker style;
only t(214,9)a fine(918,6)lmost microscopic net-work(759,8)minutest
wrinkles(364,13)round his eyes,(420,7)must(661,7)risen(577,6)his
continual sailings in many hard gales(681,6)always looking to
windward;—for(828,6)cause(940,6)muscles(400,11)eyes to become pursed
together. Such eye-(219,9)are(490,6)effectual in a scowl.

“Is(948,6)the Captain(624,8)Pequod?” said I, advanc(188,6) the door(538,8)tent.

“Supposing(940,6) the c(89,20), what dost thou want of
him?” he demanded.

“I was think(787,7)shipping.”

“T(65,6)st, wa(81,7)? I see(93,6)art no Nantucketer—ever been in(888,6)ve boat?”

“No, Sir, I never have.”

“Dost know(847,9)at all(825,7)whaling, I dare say—eh?

“N(894,6), Sir; but I(597,6)no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been
several voyages(796,8)merchant service(622,6)I(301,6) that—”

“M(39,15) be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost(327,7)at
leg?—I’ll tak(20,6) leg away(789,6)thy stern, if ever(478,6)talkest(559,8)ma(142,15)to me again. M(30,16)indeed! I suppose
now ye feel considerable proud of having served(301,6)os(122,10)
ships. But flukes! man(663,7)mak(903,6)e(664,6)to go a(478,10)eh?—it
looks a little suspicious, don’t it(44,6)Hast not(626,6)a pirate, hast
thou?—Did(36,7)rob thy last(919,8), did(731,8)—Do(79,7)(486,6)of
murdering the officers when(864,6)gettest to sea?”

I protested my innocence(937,7)se things. I saw(542,6)under(633,6)ask(1023,7)se half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated
Quakerish(928,12), was full of his(49,7)r prejudices(747,6)rather
distrustful of(914,6)liens, unless they hailed(685,6)Cape Cod or the
Vineyard.

“B(972,6)t t(523,10)a-(990,7)? I(536,9)kno(283,7)before(891,9)of
shipping ye.”

“Well, sir,(65,11)see(629,6)(605,7) is.(31,15)the world(70,6)(57,26), eh? Have ye clapped eye on(586,8) Ahab?”

“Who is(24,13), sir?”

“Aye, aye, I thought so.(70,13) is the(90,9)of(494,6)ship.”

“I am mistaken then.(79,11)I was speaking to(77,13)himself.”

“Thou art(45,13)(208,8)Peleg—that’s who ye are(89,12),
young man. It belongs to me and(285,9)Bildad(377,12)Pequod fitted
out f(560,6) voyage(646,6)supplied with all her needs, including crew. We
are part owners and agents. But as(287,7)go(284,7)say, if(974,6)wantest
(641,8)(520,17)as(1015,6)tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way
of finding it ou(716,9)ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap

leg(816,6)hat do you mean(670,6) Wa(631,6)other one lost by a whale?”

“L(20,14)! Y(137,10)come nearer(516,6): it was devoured, chewed
up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty(205,6)ever chipped a
boat!—ah, ah!”

(757,6)a little alarm(90,6)his energy, perhaps also(45,10)touched at
the hearty grief in his co(620,9)exclamation, but said as calmly as I
could, (363,6)you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know
there(219,6)ny peculiar ferocity in(491,6)particular(427,6), though indeed
I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.(509,6)ok ye now(642,13)thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou
dost not talk shark a bit. _Sure_, ye’ve been to sea(826,8)now; sure
of that?”

“Sir,”(392,6)I, “I(253,7)t I told you(786,6)I had(88,6)four voyages in
the merchant—”

“Hard down ou(270,7)at! Mind w(77,6)(506,6)bout(704,6)a(63,6)
service—don’t aggravate me—I won’(393,8)t. But let us understand each
other. I(438,6)given thee a hint(122,7)what whaling is; do ye yet feel
inclined for i(305,6)I do, sir.”

“Very good. Now, art thou(213,7)n to pitch a harpoon(281,6)a live
whale’s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!(136,6)am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so;(580,6)o
be got rid of,(784,6)is; which I (390,6)take to be th(739,6).”

“Good again. Now then(830,6) not only wantest to go a-(366,7), to find
out by experience(406,16), but ye also wan(77,8)in order to
se(156,6)world? Was(807,6)(481,7)t ye said? (738,10)so. Well(184,7)just
step forward there(404,7)ake a peep over(109,6)eather-bow(442,11)back
to me(462,6)ell m(214,7)(973,6)(89,6).”

For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not
knowing exactly how to(436,6)it, whether humorously or in earnes(839,6)
concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started
me on the errand.

Going(340,9)and glancing(330,17) bow, I perceived(658,6)the
ship swinging to her anchor with(666,6)lood-tide, was now obliquely
point(62,6)wards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but
exceedingly monotonous and forbidding(860,7)he slightest variety(864,6)I
could see.

“Well, what’(146,6)report?” said(351,7)when I came back; “what did ye
see?”

“Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon(792,7),
(714,7)re’s a squall coming up, I think.”(190,13) does(1021,6)think(781,6)of seeing(926,12)Do ye wish(970,6)
round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’(840,12)(1010,6) where
you stand?”

I was(845,10)stagger(460,7) go a-whaling I must(1002,6)I would;(977,8)
Pequod(77,6)s g(930,6)ship as any—I(314,7)(502,6)best—and all(951,6)I now
repeated to(820,6). S(282,6)me so determined, he expressed his
willingness to(126,6)me.

“And(373,6)mayest as well sig(904,6)papers right off,” he added—“come
along(837,6)ye.” And so saying, he led(935,6)ay below deck into the
cabin.

S(226,6)o(122,6)transom was(546,6)seem(257,6)me a most uncommon and
surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who (197,10)
(31,8)(827,7)as one of the largest owners(22,8)vessel; the other
shares, as is sometime(930,6)case in these ports, being held by a crowd
of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children(642,6)chancery wards;
each owning abou(616,6)value of a timber head, or a foot of plank(20,6)
nail or two(189,7) ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in
(816,8)(303,6)s,(69,6)am(538,6)that you do yours in approved state
stocks bringing in(850,6)interest.

Now,(475,9)like(815,6)(926,6)indeed many(425,6)(180,10)ers,(1011,6)
Quaker(159,6)island having been originally settled b(191,7)sect(1019,7)o
this day its inhab(452,6) in general retain in an(717,10)measure the
peculiaritie(625,9)(162,8)only variously and anomal(16,6)modified by
things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For som(757,8)s(421,6)(279,7)s a(154,6)(897,6)sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They
are fighting(201,7)s; they ar(219,8)s with a vengeance.

So(549,6)there are instances among them of men, who, named(985,6)Scripture names—a singularly (378,7)fashion o(738,6)(510,6)—(571,6)
childhood naturally imbibi(123,6)(677,6)ly dramatic thee(527,6)hou(445,7)(607,7) idiom; still, from the audacious, darin(698,7)boundless
adventur(415,8)ir subsequent lives, strangely blen(257,6)(460,6)
unoutgrown (604,13), a thous(111,6)ld dash(628,6)character, not
unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when
(603,6)(664,7)unite in a man of greatly superior(373,8) force,(545,7)
globular brai(719,6)a ponderous heart; who has also(942,6)e(378,6)ness and
seclusion of many long night-watches i(535,6)remotest waters, and

untraditional(980,7)independently; receiving all(652,6)e’s sweet or
savage impressions fresh(613,6)her own virgin voluntar(106,6)confiding
breast(637,6)thereby chiefly, but(929,6)some help(705,6)accidental
advantages, to learn a(601,6)and nervous lofty language—that man makes
on(533,7)whole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for
noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract(291,7)im,(965,9)ally
regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems
a half wilful overruling morbid(654,6)(546,6)bottom of his(486,7). For
all men trag(160,6)(813,6) are made so through a certain(99,11). Be
sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal(907,6)ness is but disease.
But, as yet w(239,7)not to do(547,7)uch an one(569,11)quite another;
and(912,6)(1024,6), who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from
(78,7) phas(219,7)e Quaker, modified by individual(435,14).

Like Captain Peleg,(15,9)Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.
But unl(77,17)—who cared not a rush for(549,6)are called
serious things(904,6)(269,7)deemed those self-same (50,14) the
veriest of all trifles—(209,15)ha(142,6)only been originally
educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket(374,7)ism, but

consistency about worthy(626,15). Though refusing,(752,6)conscientious scruples, to bear arm(800,7)st l(577,6)vaders, yet himself
had illimitably(38,7)(403,6)Atlantic and Pacific;(433,7)ough a sworn
foe to human bloodshed(105,7)ad he in(517,6)traight-bodied coat, spilled
tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening

and very probably he had long since come(848,9)age and sensible
conclusion(729,6)a man’s religion is on(190,7)(839,8)is practical world
quite another. This(26,6) pays dividends. Rising from a little
cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a
broad shad-bellied waistcoat;(114,6)that becoming boat-header,
chief-mate(232,6)c(802,6)(245,6)finally a ship owner;(829,7), as I hinted
before(1005,6)(350,6)ded his adventurous career by wholly retir(281,8)
active life at the goodly age of sixty(400,6)dedicating his remaining
days(506,8)quiet receiving (701,7)well-earned income.

Now,(219,9)I am sorry to say(218,6)the reputation of being an
incorrigible old hunks(572,6)(928,8)ea-going(830,7)a bitter, hard
task-mast(587,6)ey told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
curious story,(733,6)when he sa(920,8) old Categut whaleman, his crew,
upon arr(310,6)home, were mostly all carried ashor(876,9)hospital,
sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,
he was(235,11)rather hard-hearted,(421,7) the least. He never used
to swear(318,8), at his men, they said; but somehow he got(477,6)ordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out(966,7)m. When
(824,6) was a (888,12)to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking
at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch
something—a hammer or a marling-spike(870,6)go to(208,6)like mad, at(67,10) or other,(367,7)mind what. Indolence(773,6)dleness perished
before him. His own person was the exact embodiment(962,8)utilitarian
character. O(873,6)long, gaunt body, he(688,9)no spare flesh, no
superfluous beard(780,7)hin having a soft, economical nap to it, like
the(738,6)nap(168,8)broad-brimmed hat.

Such, then,(232,9)(247,7)that I saw seated on the transom(972,6)I
followed Captain Peleg down in(907,7)cabin. The space betwee(81,6)decks
was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old (702,6), who always sat so,
and(877,7)leaned(572,6)this(921,6)(731,7)coat tails(496,6)(285,10) was
placed beside him;(461,6)egs were stiffly crossed(31,6)drab vesture was
buttoned up to(457,9)(226,6)spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in
reading from a ponderous volume.

“(274,7)” cri(396,16), “at it again,(318,9)eh? Ye(1007,6)been
studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my
certain knowledge. How far ye got(125,8)?”

As if long habituated to such profane talk(249,6)his old shipmate,
(519,9)ithout noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up(561,6)seeing me, glanced(300,6) inquiringly towards(736,6).

“He says he’s our ma(350,10)” said(385,9)he want(645,6)hip.”

“Dost thee?(46,7)(728,8)in a hollow tone(709,7)urning round to (507,6)I _dost_(115,8)I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.

“What do ye think of him(426,10)(201,11)(246,6)’ll do(226,8)(590,9)y(324,9)(960,7)n went on spelling away at
his book(234,6)mumbling tone quite audible.

I thought him the queerest old(202,7) I ever saw, especially a(432,7),
his friend and(586,14)(885,8)such a blusterer. But I said
nothing, on(578,7)(397,10)me sharply.(884,6) now threw open a chest(623,6)drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him(693,8)ated himself at a little table. I began to(475,7)it was high time
to settle with my(75,8)what terms I would be wi(455,6)to engage for
the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they p(352,6) wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares
of the profits called _lays_(668,8)at these lays were proportioned to
the degree of importance p(111,6)(264,7)the respective duties (132,6)
(471,7)company(286,10)so(283,12)being a green hand(386,7)ling, my
own lay(393,7)not be very large(306,6)consider(297,6)at(396,7)used(169,7)
sea, could steer a ship, splice a rop(961,7)all that, I made no doubt
that from all I had heard I sh(556,8)offered at least the 275th
lay—(533,6)s,(23,10) part(314,7) clear net proceed(340,8)(618,7),
whatever(607,6)might eventu(1017,6)mount to. And thoug(876,6)(109,6)lay was
(745,6)hey call a rather _long lay_, yet(827,8)bett(116,6)n nothing; and
if we had a lucky(169,8)(155,7)pretty nearly pay for(235,7)(72,6) I
(873,6)wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,
for which(955,9)not have to pay one stiver.

I(318,8)be(295,7)t(802,8)is(975,6) poor way to accumulate a princely
fortune—and so(303,7), a(679,6)(64,9)indeed. But I am one(814,6)ose(602,6)n(470,6)ake on about(103,9) (103,7)s(676,7)m quite content i(888,6)world is ready to(283,6) and lodge me, while(134,6)putting up (249,7)
grim sign(659,8)Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I(317,16)e

surprised had I been(857,9)the 200th,(1019,13)(1014,6)of a
broad-(915,6)ered make.

But one(126,8)nevertheless,(847,7)ade me a little distrustful(403,6)
receiving a generous shar(464,7)e profit(579,6)this: Ashore, I had heard
some(768,6)of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;
how(378,9)y being(134,7)incipal proprietors(468,8)Pequod, therefore
the other and more in(352,8)able and scattered owners, left(990,8)the
whole management(582,8)ship’s affairs to these two. And I di(946,6)know
but w(593,7) stingy old(247,7)(954,7)have a(967,6)y deal to say(428,7)shipping hands, especially as I now found him on(815,7)(290,11)
(872,6)at home(304,6) i(769,6)cabin(913,6)reading his Bible as if at his
own fireside. Now(900,7)(490,6)was vainly trying to mend a pen with his
jack-knife,(268,11), to my no small (830,8)(800,14)that he
was such an interested party(218,7)se proceedings;(372,8)never heeded
us(959,7)ent on mumbl(188,7)himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”

“Well,(810,9)(257,7)”(201,6)rupted(831,6), “what d’ye say,(589,6)lay
shall we give this young man?”

“Thou knowest best,”(972,7)e sepulchral reply, “(23,6)ven hundred and
seventy-(8,6)h wouldn’t be too much,(22,6) it?—‘(233,10)(594,6)ust do
corrupt(365,6)_lay_—’”

_Lay_, indeed, thought I(655,6)(480,6) lay!(182,7)(159,31)! (345,6)(598,12)you are determined(580,6)I, for one,(332,7)no(155,7) up many _lays_ here below(457,12)(224,20). It was an ex(635,7)ly _long lay_ that(242,8); and(246,7) from
the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet
the slightest(831,9)ation will show(843,6)(125,7)(506,31) is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a
_teenth_ of it(397,6)will then see, I(728,6)(141,7)(644,36)part of a farthing(159,6)good deal less than(722,6)

“Why, blast your eyes,(961,10)cri(955,11)thou dost not want to
swindl(947,16)! he must have more(194,6)that.”

“S(925,16)(203,14)th,” again sai(768,10)without lifting
his eye(236,7)then went on mumbling—“for(746,7)your treasure is, there
will(259,6)heart be also.”

“I am going to put him down for(336,6)hree(971,8)th,”(181,6)(314,8)do
ye hear(816,7)(974,6)! T(60,18) lay(583,7).”

(1016,6) laid(115,6)his book,(877,6)urning solemnly towards him said,
“Captain(456,8)thou hast a generous(246,6); bu(835,6)(443,6)(874,8) the
duty(60,6)owest to the other owners(993,6)is ship—widows and orphans,
many(38,6)em—(433,6)at if we too abundantly reward the labo(94,10)

“Thou(458,8)” roar(813,10)starting up and clattering about the
cabin. “B(897,6)e(101,10)(750,8)if I had followed thy advice in these
matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lu(133,10)at(51,7)be
heavy enough to foun(510,7) largest ship(437,6)ever sailed round Cape
Horn.”
(630,16)(785,7)(718,7)steadily, “thy(159,12)(462,7)drawing
ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell(707,6)as(742,6)art

he’s bound to hell. Fluke(983,6)flames!(686,9)say(977,6)again to me,
and(783,6) my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat
with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,
drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”

As he thunde(317,7) this he made a rush at(951,9)but(66,6)a
marvellous oblique, sliding celerity,(792,8)for(916,6)time eluded him.

Alarmed a(125,7)terrible outburst betwee(646,6)two principal and
respons(51,6)wners(304,8)ship,(464,6)eeling half a mi(504,6)give up all
idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
commanded, I stepped aside from the door(122,9)egress to(616,9)who,
I(381,6)no doubt, was all eagern(51,7)vanish(90,6)before the awakened
wrath of(896,7) But to my astonishment, he sat down(734,7)on the
transom very quietly(334,6)seeme(825,6)ave not(367,6)lightest intention of
withdrawing. He(62,8)quite us(73,6)impenitent(176,6)(773,6)is ways. As
for(203,6), after letting off his rage as he had, ther(110,9)no more
left in him(538,6)he, too,(261,10)like a lamb, though he twitched a
little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistl(741,6)last—“the
squall’s gone off to leeward, I think.(892,9)thou(305,9)be good at
sharpening a lance, mend(881,6)pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs
the grindstone. That’s he; thank ye(973,8). Now then, my young man,
Ishmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well(60,7)down ye go here, (63,7),
for(1005,6)hree hundredth lay.”

“Captain(528,7)” said I, “I(658,6)a friend with me who wants to ship
too—shall I bring him(774,6)to-morrow?”

“To be sure(105,8)(849,7)“Fetch him along(796,6)we’ll look at him.”

“What lay does he want?” groaned(1024,9)glancing up(986,6)the book in
which(735,7)(939,7)been bury(193,7)self.

“Oh! never thee mind about that(457,8)(209,16)H(830,6)ever
whaled it any?” turning to me.

“Killed more whales than I can count, (425,13)(266,6)ell,(370,11)along then.”

And(991,8)sig(113,6)he papers, off I went; nothing doubting b(222,7) I
had done a(805,6)morning’s work(1017,6)that the Pequod was the identical
ship(836,6)Yojo had provid(898,6)carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.

But I had not proceeded far, when I began(982,6)think me(160,9)
(749,8)with whom I(173,6)o sail yet remained unseen by me; though,
indeed, in many cases, a(441,6)-ship will be completely fitted out, and
receive all her crew on board, ere the c(926,7)makes(662,8) visible by
arriv(589,7)take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,
(455,6)e shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,(548,6)if the
(171,8)have a family, or any absorbing concernment of(615,6)sort, he
does not trouble(243,9)much(887,7)his ship in port, but leaves her to
the owners till all is ready(282,6)ea. However, it is always as well to
(204,7)look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his
hands. T(1012,7)back I accosted(982,14), inquiring where(1013,8)
Ahab(682,8)be found.

“And what dost thou wa(345,6)(748,8)Ahab? It’s all right enough(726,6)
art shipped.”

“Yes(340,6)I should like to see him.”

“(909,6)don’t (874,6)(127,6)ilt be able to at present.(47,9)know
exactly what’s the matter(926,6)him; but he keeps close inside the
house; a sort of sick, and yet he(158,7)look so. In fact, he ain’t
sick(103,6)no, he isn’t(512,6)either. Any how, young man, he won’t(564,7)
see me, so(276,9)suppose he will thee. He’s a queer(75,6)(483,12)—so some(337,6)—but a good one. Oh, thou’lt(403,6)him(172,7)(464,7)no
fear, no fear(113,9)grand, ungodly, god-like(132,13) Ahab;
doesn’t speak much; but, when(343,6)es(30,6), then you may(824,6)listen.
Mark ye,(689,6)rewarned; Ahab’s above the common(25,9)been in
colleges,(914,9)as ’mong(54,6)annibals;(50,6)used to deeper wonders
than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than
whales. His(50,6)! aye, t(670,6)nest and the surest that out of all our
isle! Oh!(642,9)(935,9)Bildad; no(706,6)(33,17)Peleg;
_he’s Ahab_, boy; and Ahab of old(547,6) knowest, was a crowned king!”

“And a very vile(609,6)When(185,6)wick(47,7) was slain(240,6)dogs, did
they not lick his blood?”

“Come hither to me—(13,6),(21,7),” said(215,6),(1012,6)a signific(405,7)
his eye(333,6)almost startled me. “Loo(614,6)lad; never say(383,7)n board
the Pequod. N(36,9)it anywhere.(772,13) did not name himself.
’T(333,6)foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mo(247,6)who died

Gayhead,(325,6)tha(44,6)name would somehow prove prophetic. And,
perhaps, other fools like her may tell the(932,6)same. I wish to warn
thee. It’s a lie. I know(332,14)well; I’ve sailed(493,6)him as
mate years ago;(66,8)what he is—a good man—not a pious,(22,9),
like(833,7), but a swearing(60,10)something(231,6)me—only there’s a
good deal more(462,6)m. Aye,(1005,6)(221,7)t(155,7)was(624,7)very jolly;
and(41,13)on the passage home,(510,8)a little out(574,8)mind
for a spell; but it was(394,6)harp shooting pains in(895,7)eeding stump
that brought(835,7)bout, as any one might se(445,9), too,(882,6)ever
since he lost his leg last voyage b(879,7)accursed whale, he’s been a
kind of moody—desperate(16,6), and savage sometimes(251,6)that will all
pass off(803,6)once for all, let me(697,11)and assure thee, young
man, it’s better to sail(664,6)a(163,6)(629,6)c(713,7)than a laughing bad
one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not(780,13), because he happens
to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy,(51,6)s a wife—not three(389,7)s
wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that;(436,9)sweet girl that
old man(107,7)child: hold ye then(818,6) can be any utter, hopeless harm
(1022,7)? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his
humanities!”

As I walked away, I was full(215,6)oughtfulness; what had been
incidentally revealed to me of(421,15)filled me(530,8)certain
wild vagueness of pain(115,7) concerning him(674,6)somehow, at the time,
I felt a sympathy(683,6) sorrow for him, but for I don’t know what,
unless it was the cruel lo(153,6)(936,7)(808,6)yet I also(121,9)trange
awe(46,6)m(878,11)sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was
not exactly awe; I do no(178,11)(170,7). But (256,7)it; and it did
not disincline me towards(159,6)(481,6)(60,9)mpatience at(493,6)seemed
like mystery in(330,6)so imperfe(165,6)s he was known(521,7)then.
However, my(597,8)s were at length carried in other directions, so
tha(442,6)the present dark(738,6)slipped my mind.


CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.

As Queequeg’s(24,8), or Fasting and Humiliation,(531,6)o continue all

cherish the greatest respect(429,9)everybody’s religious obliga(290,6)
never mind how comical, and coul(163,6)fi(540,6)in my heart to undervalue
even a congre(94,6) of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those(443,6)
creatures in(1002,8) parts of our earth, who with a degree of
footmanism quite unprecedent(545,12)planets, bow down before the
torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the
inordinate possessions yet owned and r(145,9)his name.

I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
things(446,6)not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to(824,7)mortals,
pagans and(973,6)not, because(232,7)ir half-crazy conceits o(136,8)subjects. Ther(991,6)(826,8), now,(479,8)ly ent(491,6)ing the most
absurd notions about Yojo and hi(896,9);—but(170,6)of that?(934,9)
thought he knew(209,6)h(145,6)about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;
and there let him rest. All our arguing(660,6)him w(827,9)avail; let
him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—(515,12)(399,6)Pagans
alike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked(316,7)the head, and
sadly need mending.

Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and
rituals must be over, I went up to his room and kno(164,6)(161,6)door;
but no answer. I tri(405,6)open it, but it was fastened inside.
“(619,9)” said I softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “(904,6)
(686,8)! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” Bu(277,6)remained still
as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant
time; I (716,11)might(566,6)had an apoplectic fit. I looked(243,8)
(243,12); b(529,7)door opening into an odd corner(1007,7) room, the
(310,8) prospec(387,6)but a cr(115,6)and sinister one. I could only see

had taken from him,(504,7) our mounting to the chamber. That’s strange,
(483,8)I(418,6)at any rate, since(966,6)(159,6) stands yonder, and he
seldom or never goes abroad without it, ther(163,6)he(943,9)(835,6)

Apoplexy!(987,12)burst(993,6)(666,8)(680,6)it stubbornly resisted.
Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions(385,8)first person
I met—(408,11)-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “(904,10)s(228,13)
b(413,6)matter. I went to mak(440,6)bed after breakfast(438,6)(906,9)was

baggage in for safe keeping. (286,6), ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.
Hussey! a(499,8)”—an(649,6) thes(345,6)s, she ran towards the kitchen, I
following.

Mrs. (89,6) soon appeared,(88,6)a mustard-pot in one hand and a
vinegar-cruet i(624,6)other, having(338,6)broken away(984,6)the occupation
of attend(987,12)astors(910,6)scolding her little black boy
meantime.

“Wood-house!”(619,6) I, “which way to it? Ru(395,6)God’s sak(935,7)fetch

again empty-handed, when (444,12)interpose(770,6)(437,12)and(423,14)(809,10)entir(361,8) of her countenanc(335,6)hat’(580,6)(912,6)(625,6)you, young man?”

“Get (271,9)F(346,15)r(366,7)(928,6)ctor, some one, while I pry
it open!”

“Look here,” sai(991,6)landlady, quickly putting dow(642,6)(240,14)
so as to have(707,10)free; “l(101,8); are you talking about prying
open any of my doors?(900,13)at she seized my arm. (323,11)
(323,15)? (351,28)shipmate?”

In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand
the whole case. Unconsciously clapping(322,18) to one side of
her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t
seen it since I put it there.” Runn(896,7)a(1010,8)closet(211,6) the
landing of the(819,7)(151,6)glanced in(984,6)returning, told me that
Queequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed himself,” she cried. “It’s
unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes anot(878,10)rpane—God
pity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin(646,7)house. Ha(931,6)poor lad
a sister? Where’s(671,6)girl?(136,6), Betty, go to Snarle(1001,6)Painter,
and tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides permitted(952,6) and
no smoking i(929,6)parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill?
The Lord be merciful to his ghost!(848,10)at noise(592,6)? You, young
man, avas(621,7)!”

And r(626,7)up after m(738,7)caugh(248,6)s I was(465,6) try(675,7)force
ope(224,6)door.

“I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go fo(735,7)ocksmith,(791,6)’s one about a mile from here. But(216,6)!” putting her
hand in her side-pocket, “(540,7)a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s
see.” And with that(1022,6)turned it(475,8)lock; but, alas! (865,10)
supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.

“Have to burst it open,” said I(985,6)was(443,9)dow(609,6)entry a
little, for a good start, wh(428,7)landlady(487,8)at me,(482,7)vowing
I should not break(107,6)her(450,9); but I tor(406,10)(163,7)ith a
sudden bodily rush dashed myself full(603,6)(668,6) mark.

With a prodigious(732,10) door flew(284,6) and the knob slamming
(85,12)wall, sen(100,6)plaster to the ceiling;(73,8)re, good
heavens!(850,6) sat(475,9), altogether cool and self-collected; right
(551,7)middle of the room; squa(694,6)on his hams(485,6)holding Yojo on
top of(37,6)ead. He looked neither one way n(845,6) other way, but sat
like a carved image(736,6)scarce a sign of active life.

“(249,9)(651,10)going up to him, (37,10) what’s(466,7)tter with
you?”

“He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?(764,7)(697,12).

But all we said, not a word could we drag out(313,6)m; I almost fel(269,7)pushing him over, so as to change his position(856,6)it was(76,7)
intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
especially, as in all probability he had(301,6)(299,6)g so for upwards of
eight or ten hours(421,8)too without his regular meals.

“Mrs. Hussey(482,11)“he’s _alive_ a(370,6)events; so leave us, if you
please(915,6)I will see(873,6)is strange affair myself.”

Closing(991,10)upo(822,6)(499,8), I endeavored to prevail upon
(920,8) to ta(740,6)hair; but in vain. There he sat(1008,6)all he(563,6)
do—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg,
nor say a single word, nor even look at me(21,6)notice my presence in
the slightest way.

I wonder, thought I, if(348,6)can possibly be a par(762,7)s Ramadan; do
they fast (356,6)ir hams that way in his native island. It must be so;
yes, it’s(104,13)creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll
get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last f(328,6)r, thank God,
and(231,12) only comes once a year(498,6)I don’t believe(196,6)very
punctual then(368,6)ent down to supper. After(903,9)a long time listen(881,6)(702,6)ong
stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,
as they called it (that is, a short whaling-(52,6) in a sch(347,8)
brig, confin(837,6)the north of(880,6)ine, i(893,6)Atlantic Oce(342,7));
after(236,17)se(184,13)ers till nearly eleven o’clock, I
wen(506,6)tairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by(745,6)time (1008,8)
must certainly have br(798,6)(530,12)to a termination. But no; there
he was(396,6)where I had left him; he ha(1007,6)stirred an inch. I began
to grow vexed with(60,6)it seemed so downright senseless and insane to
be(607,9)there all day and hal(427,6)night o(941,6)hams(497,6)cold room,
hold(676,6)piece of wood(52,9)ead.

“For heaven’s sake,(352,9), (928,7)and shake yourself;(27,11)
have(734,7)(806,7)You’ll starve; y(15,6)kill(66,9)(103,10).” But
not a word did he reply.

Despairing of him,(440,6)fore, I de(476,6)(726,6)(585,9) and to sleep;
and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me(555,6)previous to
turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket,(131,6)hrew it over(191,6)as
it promis(908,6)be a very(451,6)night;(499,6)(635,9)hing but his
ordinary round(113,7) on. For(398,6)time, do all I(218,6), I could not
get in(964,6) faintest doze.(771,7)blown out the candle(152,6)the mere
th(882,6)of(922,9)—not four feet off—(724,14)in that uneasy
position, stark alon(37,7)e(724,6)and dark; this made me really
wretched. Think of it;(506,6)ing all(818,7)(84,7)same room(936,6)a wide
awake pagan(859,16)this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!

But somehow I dropped off at las(529,7)knew(464,9)more till break of
day; when, looking(571,6)the bedside(770,7) squatted(948,11)as if he
had been screwed down (493,8)loor(733,6)as soon as(519,6)irst glimpse of
sun entere(501,6)window, up he got,(325,6)stiff and grating joints, but
(360,7)cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his
forehead again(6,6)st min(657,7)said his(401,8) was over.

Now, as I(1017,8)hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion,
be it what it may, so long(318,6)at(54,7) does not kill or insult any
other(95,7), because(784,6)(27,12) don’t believe it also(436,6)when
a ma(160,12) becomes(790,7) frantic(588,6) it is a (876,6)ve torment
to him; and, in fine, makes(877,6)earth of ours an uncomfor(768,6)inn to
lodge in; then I think it high time to tak(236,7)individual aside and
argue the point(927,6)him.

And just so I now did(960,6)(766,8). “(777,9)”(529,6)I, “get into bed
now(903,6)lie(8,7)sten to me.” I(192,6)went (416,6)ginning(742,6)the rise
and progress of(180,6)rim(349,6)(564,8)s(1011,6)coming(898,13)various
(42,9)(69,10)esent time, during whic(325,7)I labored to show
(1021,8)(642,6)all these Lents,(784,8)(139,7)prolonged ham-squattings
in cold,(932,6)less rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;
useless(24,9)soul; oppose(604,6)short,(259,8)obvious laws of Hygien(347,6)common sense. I told him, too,(876,6)he being in(826,7)things such
an extremely sensibl(498,6)sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly
(22,11)to see him now so deplorably foolish about(823,6)ridiculous
(386,7) of his. Besides, argued I, fasting(888,9)e body cave in;
henc(793,6)spirit caves in; and(501,7)oughts born of a fast must
necessarily be half-starved. This i(119,6)reason why most dyspeptic(682,9)ists cherish such melancholy notions(265,9)eir hereafters. In
one word,(952,9),(940,9)rather digressively; hell is an idea first
(230,6)n an undigested apple-dumpling(285,6)si(316,7)n perpetuated
throug(979,6)hereditary(241,7)sias nurtured by(838,9).

I(76,6)asked(196,9) whether he himself was ever troubled with
(98,9); expressing the(223,6)very plainly, so(749,9)could take it
in. He(314,6)no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great
feast given by his f(389,6)the king, on the gaining(603,6)great battle
wherein fifty of the enemy had been kill(331,6)(805,7)wo o’clock in the
afternoon,(725,9)cooked and eaten(1018,6)very evening.

“No more(594,11)”(595,9)shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the
inferences without(272,6)ur(474,6)int(426,7)m. I had seen a sailor who
had visited(173,11)island(216,6)he told me(475,6)i(408,6)the custom,
when(357,15)(330,10)gained there, to barbecue all the slain in
the yard or garden(414,8)victor(801,6)then, one by one, they were
placed in(498,7)wooden trenchers(427,6)garnished round like a pilau,
with breadfruit and cocoanuts(932,6)with some parsley(532,7)ir mouths,
were sent(100,7)wit(957,6)(203,6)’s compliments to all(720,6)riends, just
as th(1017,8)se presents (96,6)o many Christmas turkeys.

A(825,6)ll, I do not think(930,6)my remarks(738,7)religion made much
im(1008,6)on(939,6)(688,8). Because,(780,7) first place, he somehow
seemed dull of hearing(931,6)at important subject, unless considered
from his own point of view; and(132,9)second(133,11)did not more
than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would(106,6)
finally, he no doubt(416,7)t he(924,6)a good deal more(352,7)the true
(361,9)than I did. He looked at me(610,6)a sort of condescending
concern(666,7)mpassion, (557,10)he(151,9)it(923,9)pity(998,6)such
a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan
piety.

At last we rose and dresse(319,6)(575,9), taking a prodigiously hearty
breakfas(249,6)howders of all sorts, so(710,6)the landlady(187,8)not
mak(708,6) profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the
Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth(997,6)halibut bones.


CHAPTER 18. His Mark.

As we(968,6)walking dow(848,6)end of the wharf towards(745,6)hip,(909,9)
carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us(872,10)wigwam, sa(87,6)e ha(842,6)suspected my friend was a cannibal,
and further(766,6)nnouncing(1012,6)he let no(52,9)s on(373,9)at
craft, unless they prev(550,7)produced their papers.

“What do you mean b(749,6)(268,15)?” said I, now jumping on the
bulwarks(482,6)leaving my comrade stand(49,10)(415,6).

“I mean,” he replied, “he must show his(176,8)”

“Yes,(141,7)(430,8)Bildad(431,8)hollow(432,6), st(624,7)his head from
behind(488,6)’s, out(571,9)igwam. “H(134,12)(390,7)’s converted.
S(794,6)darkness(199,6)added, turning to(963,11)“art thou at present
in communion(781,6)any Christian church?”

“Why(253,8)I, “he’s a member(763,8)first Congregational Church.” Here
be it said,(607,6)many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at
last come to be(280,10) into the(186,7)es.

“F(151,26),” cried(457,7), “what!(762,6)wor(115,6)in
Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so(912,7), taking out
his spectacles, he rubb(798,6)m(387,6)(1017,6)eat yellow bandana

(599,8).

“How(29,6)hath he been(539,9)?” he then(501,8)(669,10)me; “not
very long, I rather guess, young man.”

“No(897,8)Pel(726,6)nd he hasn’t(123,6)baptized right either, or it
would have washed some(897,6)at devil’s blue off his face.”

“Do tell, now(570,18)is this Philistine a regular(809,10)(586,19)(578,10)? I never saw him go(480,7)re(499,6)I pass
it every Lord’s day.”

“I don’t know anything about (708,19)or hi(705,9)(993,7)
I; “all I(71,6)is(940,7)(503,8) here is a born(221,10) the First

“Y(504,8)(497,8)(929,6) sternly, “thou art skylarking(832,6)me—explain
thy(95,6)thou(588,7)Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”

Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same
ancient Catholic(272,7) to which you(479,6)(985,6)Captain(743,6)(511,7)
and(387,14)(969,6)all of us(984,6)(535,6)mother’s son and sou(39,7)

join hand(569,6)Splice(498,7)mean’st _splice_(40,6)(955,9)Peleg, drawing nearer.(637,12) you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast

Mapple(806,8) couldn’t beat it(556,6)he’s reckoned something. Come
aboard, come (13,6);(147,7)mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog
there—what’s that you call him?(44,12) to step along. By(616,10)
anchor, what a harpoon(194,6)got(745,6)! looks like good stuff(592,7)and
he handles it(194,7)right(189,9)(184,6), or whatever your name is, did
you ever stand in the h(460,9)whale-boat? did (48,11)rike a
fish?”

Without saying a word,(942,9), in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one(915,6)e(166,11)s
hangi(895,8)e side; and then bracing his left knee(581,6)pois(27,7)
(407,7),(806,7)out in(964,6)such way as this:—

“Cap’ai(813,6) see him small drop tar on water dere? Y(42,10)? well,
spos(59,6)on(213,7) eye,(31,6) den!”(203,6)aking sharp aim (780,7)he
darted the iron(533,6) over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the
ship’s decks(866,6)struck(712,6)listening tar spot out of sight.

“Now,” said(513,11)quietly hauling(621,8)line, “spos-(314,7)(630,6)e
eye; why, dad(273,7)dead.”

“Quick,(210,7)(110,8)Peleg, his partner, who, aghast a(1001,6)close
vicinity(583,8)flying(916,8), had retreated towards(64,6)abin

(1004,8)we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay(744,6)that’s more than(1024,6)was
given a(257,8)eer ye(477,9)Nantucket.”

So down we went(926,10)cabin(105,7)o my great joy(522,9) was soon
enrolled among(944,6)am(297,9)company to which I myself belonged.

When all preliminaries were(759,6)an(535,7) had got everything ready for
signing, he turne(193,6)e(767,6)aid, “I guess,(407,7)(428,6) don’t know
how to write, does he?(536,8)(461,8)blast ye! dost thou sign thy name
or make thy mark?”

Bu(703,7)is question,(863,11)who had twice or thrice before taken
part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taki(418,6)
offered pen, copied upo(973,6)paper,(987,8)proper place, an exact
counterpart of a queer round figure(497,7)was tattoo(101,8)his arm; so
that through Captain(491,6)’s obstinate mistake touching his
appellative, it stood some(537,6)like this:—
(864,7). his X mark.

Meanwhile(123,9)(1012,6) sat earnestly(575,6)teadfastly eyeing(440,10)
and at last rising solemn(61,7)fumbling(341,8)huge pockets of his
broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts(933,6)selecting one
entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,”(480,6)d it in
(998,8)’s hand(103,7)then grasp(583,7)m(23,8) book with both his,

bondsman. Spur(876,6)idol Bell(355,9) hideous dragon; turn from the
wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer
clea(312,7)e fiery pit!”

S(827,9)(30,7)salt sea yet lingered in old(811,7)’s language,
heterogeneously mixed(537,6)Scriptural and domestic phrases.

“Avast there, a(13,12)(918,6)(21,8)now spoiling our harpooneer,”
cried Peleg. “Pious(33,11)s never make good voyagers—it takes the
shar(886,6)of ’em; no(104,11) is worth a straw who aint pretty(65,6)ish. There was young Nat Swaine, once(834,6)ravest boat-header out
(688,7)Nantucket(883,9)Vineyard; he joine(907,6)meeting(947,6)never

shrinked(949,6)heered away(665,6)whales, for f(605,7)after-claps, in case
h(124,7)tove and went to Davy Jones.”

“Peleg!(453,6)!” sai(623,8), lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself,
as I m(13,6) hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,(576,6), what
it is to hav(430,6)(229,8)death; how, then, can’st(77,6)prate in this
ungodly guise. Thou beliest(962,7)own hear(127,8). Tell me, whe(71,7)same Pequod here had her three masts overboard(126,6)at typhoon on

“Hear him, h(10,7) now,” (946,11), marching across the cabin, and
thrus(512,9)hands far down into(709,6)ockets,—“(107,8), all of ye.
T(179,8)that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink!(235,6)

nearest port;(706,6)(132,9)(115,14) of.”

Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where
we followed him. T(868,6)e stood, very quietly overloo(468,6)ome
sailmakers who were mending a top-sail(917,6)e waist. Now(822,8)n he
stooped to pick up a patch, or(340,7)n end of tarred twine, which
otherwise might have been wasted.


CHAPTER 19. The Prophet.

“Shipmates,(58,6)y(770,6)ped(186,6)at ship?”

Queequeg(524,7)had just lef(827,6)Pequod, and(271,6)saunt(744,7)way from
(270,6)ter, for the(906,8)each occupied with his own(930,8)s, when the
above words(381,6)put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
levelled his massive forefinger a(919,6)vessel in question. H(808,6)but
shabbily appar(81,6)in faded jacket and(470,6)ed trowsers; a rag of a
black handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all
directions f(730,6)over his face(412,6)left it like the complicated
ribbed bed of a torrent(377,10) rushing(453,6)s(625,11)dried up.

“H(589,18)her?” he repea(667,6)“You mea(805,6)ship(582,9)I suppose,”(1003,6)I, trying to gain a little
more time for an uninterrupted look at him.

“Aye,(689,11)—(742,9) there,” he said, drawing back his whole arm,
(968,9)rapidly shoving it straight out from him,(724,6)the fixed
bayonet of his pointed (639,7)darted full(651,8)object.

“Yes(280,11)“we(1017,6)just signed the articles.”

“Anything d(851,6)ere about your souls?”

“About what?”

“Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any(304,10) quickly. “No matter(955,7),
I know many chaps that(77,17)—good luck to ’em; (361,7)y are
all the better off for it. A soul’s a sort(704,6)fifth wheel to a
wagon.”

“What are you jabbering(275,6), shipmate?(639,8).

“_He’s_ got enough,(224,8) to make up(645,6)ll deficiencies of that
sort in other(266,6),” abruptly(747,6)the stranger, placing a nervous
emphasis upo(917,6)word _he_.

“Queequeg(546,12)let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from
somewhere; he’s talk(282,9) some(584,6)and somebody we don’t know.”

“Stop!” cri(654,7)(211,8). “Y(562,7)true—ye(596,9)seen Old Thunder

“A(32,26)!” laugh(463,15),(362,6)a solemnly
derisive(904,9)laugh. “Look ye; when (372,12) is (155,9), then

“My friend,” said I, “wha(284,6)this gibberish of yours is(785,6), I
(376,6)know(1007,6)(394,8)much care; for it seems to me(842,6)(967,9)be
a little damaged in the head(1013,6)if you are speaking of (948,12),
of(933,6)ship there, the Pequod, then let me(451,6)you,(984,6)I know all
(472,11)oss of(725,8).”

“_All_(922,7)it, eh—sure you do?—all?”

“Pretty sure.”

With finger pointed and eye levelled a(895,6)(175,11) beggar-like
stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie;(245,6)starting a
(362,6), turn(133,7)said:—“Ye’ve shipped,(693,6)ye? Names down on the
papers? Well, w(6,6)hat’s signed, i(11,8)(660,6)(30,7)to be, will

I suppose; as well these as any(56,8)en, God pity ’em! Morning to ye,
shipmates, m(26,6); the ineffable heavens bless ye; I’m sorry I stopped

“Look (713,6)(938,18)(788,7)have anything important to tell
us, out(237,6)it; b(848,14)only try(198,7)bamboozle us,(885,8)

“And(425,6)said very(555,7)and I like to hear a chap talk up(967,6)way;

great secret in hi(160,6)(269,25)(667,8)(38,13)it is(607,9). “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this crazy
man. But stop(334,7)me(555,6)nam(1012,7) you?”

“Elijah.”

(10,6)! thought I(543,6)we walked away, both commenting, after each
other’s fashion, upon(157,6)ragged old sailor; and agreed(614,6)he was
no(832,6)but a humbug,(791,12)e a bugbear(234,6)w(384,6)not gone
perhaps above a hundred yards,(628,6)chanc(873,7)turn a corner, and
looking back as I did so, who should be seen but (328,6) following us,
(331,6) at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so,(891,6)I
said (277,8)to(514,9)(53,6)s being behind, but passed on with my
comrade, anxious to see whether(138,6)tranger would(277,6)the same(284,7)
(835,6)e did. He did(456,6)then it seemed to me(470,12) dogg(279,8)but(154,6)what intent I coul(999,6)fo(147,6)life of me imagine. This
circum(337,6), coupled(238,6)his ambiguous, half-hi(684,7)half-revealing,
shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments

withou(813,6)(981,7)notice us(737,6) relieved me(865,6)once more, and
finally as(886,16), I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.


CHAPTER 20. All Astir.

A day or two(185,7)(718,6)ther(976,6)great activity aboar(697,6)(731,6).
Not only were the old sails being mended, but new(28,7)were coming on
boar(126,7)bolts of canva(865,7)coils of rigging; in short, everything
betokened(490,6)(745,8)’s preparation(125,7)hurry(409,7)a close.
(838,14)seldom or never went ashore(208,6)sat in his wigwam
keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all(885,6)urchasing
and providing (203,8)tore(933,11)men employed i(94,7)old(587,7)
the(304,8)(415,6)working till long after night-fall.

O(167,6)day following(792,9)’s signing the articles, word(563,6)iven at
(214,8)inns wh(543,8)(400,7)compan(567,7)stopping,(439,9)ir chests
must be on (638,6)before(180,6), for(688,11)no telling how so(372,6)
vessel might be sailing. So(1011,9) and I got down our traps,
resolving, however, to sleep(528,7)(340,6)the last. But(948,8)s they
alway(288,6) very(385,6)notice(446,7)se case(756,7)(702,8) did not sail
for several days(107,6)no wonder;(958,11)a good deal to be done, and
(996,6)i(307,17)many things(52,7)thought of,(380,8)the Pequod
was fully equipped.

Every one knows what a multitude of(100,7)—beds, sauce-pans, knives and
forks, shovels(760,6)ongs, napkins, nut-cracker(311,7)what not, are
indispensable to the business of house(950,7). Just so with whaling,
which necessitates a three-years’(70,13)(1003,10)wide ocean, far
from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, ba(209,10)bankers. And
(398,6) this also holds true of merchant (754,6)s, yet not by any means
(264,7)same extent as(245,10)emen. For besides the great length of
the(291,8) voyage, the numerous articles peculiar(384,8)prosecution
of the fishery(762,10)impossibility of replacing them at the remote
harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,
(206,9)(317,6) a(748,7)most exposed to accidents(64,8)kind(950,6)
especially(622,8)destruction and lo(634,6)the ver(879,9)upon which
the succ(676,7)the(354,7)(139,6)depends. Henc(374,7)spare boats,(13,6)
spa(789,8)(30,6)lin(858,6) harpoon(30,13)every(1019,6), almost, but
a(93,7)Captai(197,6)duplicate ship.

A(400,6)period of our arrival(429,8)Island(550,6)heaviest storage(274,7)
Pequod had been(137,7) completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,
fuel(829,6)iron hoop(248,6)staves. But, as before hi(555,6)for some time
there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds(531,6)nd(497,7)(348,6)both large(412,6)mall.

Chief among those who did(1006,6)(120,22)was(408,8)
Bildad’s sister, a lean old lady of a(578,8)termined(294,6)ndefatigable
spiri(508,6) withal(680,6)kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if _she_
could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the (513,6), after
once fairly getting to sea. At on(428,6) she would come(399,10)with a
jar of pickles for(821,6)teward’s pantry; another(85,6)(61,6) bunch of
quill(62,10)chief mate’s desk, where he kept his log; a third(599,6)(86,7)roll of flannel(148,10)ma(25,6)s(201,6)e’s rheumatic back.
Never did any woman better deserve her name, which(553,6)harity—Aunt
(13,7), as(1019,6)body called her. And like a(594,7) of c(68,6)(664,9)
(17,6)able Aunt(101,8) bustle about hither and t(12,6), ready to turn
her han(656,6)heart to any(565,6)that promised to yield safety, comfort,
and consolation to all(927,10)a ship in(279,7)her beloved brother(840,7) was concerned,(808,7)(334,7)she herself owned a score or two of
well-saved dollars.

But it was startl(721,9)e(999,6)excellent(261,6)ed Quakeress coming on
board, as she(396,7)e last day,(698,8)long oil-ladle in one han(208,6)
a still longer whaling lance(912,8)other. Nor was (285,7)himself nor
Captain Peleg at all backward. A(880,6)(342,6), he carried(540,7)with him
(176,7)list of the articles need(390,8)at(689,6) fresh arrival, down
wen(889,6)mark opposite(576,6)(78,7) upo(220,6)paper. Every o(245,7)a
while(207,7)came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men
dow(323,6)hatchways(39,10)up to the riggers(57,9)ast-hea(418,7)then concluded by(105,9)back into(142,6)igwam.

Dur(816,6)ese days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the
craft(363,7)s(32,7)I ask(435,9)(498,8)Ahab(794,6)how he was(602,6)when(17,7) go(741,7)come(907,10)his ship. To(176,7)questions they
would answer,(451,6)(83,8)etting better and(11,7)(936,6)was expected
a(1018,6)(563,6)day; meantime, the two c(707,6)s,(709,8)nd(689,9)could
attend to(636,6)thing necessary to fi(507,6)vessel for(15,6)oyage. If I
had been downright hones(774,7)myself, I (251,6)have seen very plainly
in my heart(729,6)I did but half fancy being commit(475,6)is way to so
long a(159,7), without(774,6)laying my eyes (814,7)man who was to be the
absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out(901,10)open
sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens(989,6)if he
be already involved i(191,8)(545,6)he insensibly strives(671,6)ver up
his suspicions even from himself. And much(341,10)it was(455,7)e. I
said nothing(846,6)tried(1016,6)ink(28,8).

At last(69,8)given ou(478,7)some time next day(337,10)would
certainly sail. So(43,6)morning(1012,17)took a(597,6)early
start.


CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.

I(227,6)nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn,(474,6)we
drew nigh the wharf.

“There are(240,6)sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” sai(216,6)
(234,8), “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess; come
on!”

“Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner a(1011,6)sa(418,8)coming close
behind us, laid a hand(762,6)both our shoulders(548,7)hen insinuating
(628,7) between us, stood stooping forward a little,(755,8)un(538,7)
twilight, strangely peering(731,6)(546,9)to(704,6)(720,6)Elijah.

“(525,6)aboard?”

“Hands off, will you(394,9).

“Lookee here(418,8)(413,10)shaking(850,8), “go ’way(378,6)in’t g(114,11), then?”

“Yes, we a(88,10)I, “but what business is(832,6)of yours? Do you
know, Mr.(223,7),(872,6)I consider you(334,9)(719,6)tinent?”

“No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of tha(658,9)(95,8)slowly and
wonderingly look(385,9)me to(290,11)wit(802,6)most unaccountable
glances.

“(194,7)(265,11)you(401,6)oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We
are(367,7)to the Indian and Pacific Ocean(678,7)would prefer not to be
detained.(424,6) be, be ye? C(793,6)back afore breakfas(341,6)He’s cracked,(553,10)(481,11)come on.”

“Holloa(924,9)stationary(466,9)hailing us when we had removed a few
pa(326,7)Never mind him(599,12)(691,10)(128,11)But he stole up to us again(966,6)suddenly clapp(745,6)s(1022,6)on my
(1014,8), said—“Did ye see anything(543,9)like men(418,9)ward(732,6)
ship a while ago?”

Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes,
I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim(525,6) sure.”

“Very dim, v(10,8)(800,13). “Morn(638,7)ye.”

Once more we quitted him(112,6)o(30,9)he came softly after us; and
touching my (369,8)(422,8)said, “See if you can find ’em now, will
ye?

“Find who?”

(174,14)! m(15,13)” he rejoined,(533,6) moving off. “Oh! I
was(883,10)warn ye(579,6)st—but n(660,9),(12,11)—it’s all one,
all in the family too;—sharp frost(517,6)(164,7), ain’t it? Good-bye to
ye. Shan’t see(138,9)(433,6)so(552,6)guess; unless it’s before the
Grand Jury.” And with these(984,8) words he finally departed, leaving
me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.

At last, ste(896,6)on board the Pequod, we found ever(886,7)in profound
quiet, not a soul(457,7). The cabin entrance was lo(232,6)ithin; the
hatches were(440,7), and lumber(46,7) coils of rigging. Going forward
to(485,6)orecastle(190,11)the slide of(13,6)cuttle open. Seeing a
light, we went dow(139,7)(261,6)only an old rigger there, wrapped in a
tattered pea-jacket. H(256,6)thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
face downwards and inclos(105,6)his folded arms(371,6)(410,8)est s(321,6)
slept(99,6)him.

“Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,
looking dubiously at(363,7)eeper. But it seemed that, when on the
wharf(121,10) had(588,6)t all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I
would(165,6)thought myself to(188,6)been optic(853,7)ceiv(431,6)that
matter,(643,6)it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question(234,6)I
be(258,7)(810,6)down; and again marking(292,12), jocularly hinted to
(273,9)that perhaps we had best sit up(794,6)the body; telling him to
establish himself accordingly. He put his hand(645,7)(448,10)’s rear,
as(345,7) feeling if it was soft enough(235,6)then, without more ado,
sat quietly down(827,6).

“Gracious!(642,11)don’(230,6)(866,6)(630,8).

“Oh! perry dood seat(32,8)(707,10)“my country way; won’t hurt him
face.”

“Face!(725,9) “call(376,6)his face? very benevolent(89,6)enance then;
but how hard he breathes, he’s heav(409,7)self; get of(764,11), you
are heavy, it’s grind(563,8)face of the poor. G(70,16)! Look,
he’ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he(358,7)wake.”
(630,10)removed(566,9)to just beyo(482,6) head(140,8)(715,9)and
lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat (802,7)feet. We kep(820,6)pipe passing
over(808,14)from one to the(915,6). Meanwhile,(704,6)(915,8)ing
him in his broken fashion(375,10) gave me to underst(709,6)at,(60,7)

fellow(201,7)lay them round(187,8)pier(275,6)alcoves. Besides, it was
very convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs
which are(75,6)rtible into walking-sticks;(543,6)occasion, a chief
call(923,6)s attendant(421,6)desir(951,7) to make a(498,7) of(975,8)

While narrat(1002,7)se things, every time(691,10)receive(905,6)(868,8)
from me, he flourish(36,7)hatchet-side of it (864,16)’s head.

“What’s(541,6)for(812,10)?”

“Perry easy, kill-e; oh! p(24,9)!”

He was going on with(259,6)wild reminiscences about his(205,9)-pipe,(477,6), it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his fo(911,9)othed
his soul, when we(871,6)directly attracted(991,8)sleeping rigger. The
strong vapor now completely fi(581,6)the con(79,8)hole, it began to
tell(650,6)him. He breathed(292,6)a sort of muffledness; then(261,7)
trouble(876,9)nose(34,7)revolved(479,6)once or twic(34,8)sat up and
rubb(306,7)eyes.

“Holloa!” h(152,11)at last, “who be ye smokers?”

“Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”

“Aye, aye, ye are(552,7)in her,(99,6)? S(51,7)s to-day. The Captain
came aboard last night.”(705,7)(40,8)?—Ahab?(23,6)o but him indeed?”

I(681,11)to ask him(943,6)further questions concerning Ahab(593,9)
heard a noise on deck(339,11) Starbuck’s astir,” sai(964,6)(614,8)“He’s a lively chief mate,
that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so
saying he went(169,8)(80,6)we followed.

It was(745,6)lear sunrise. Soo(634,6)crew came on (395,6)in twos and
three(701,6)(841,7)s bestirred themselv(34,8)mates(921,6)actively

CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.

At length, towards noon, up(326,7)final dismiss(224,12)ip’s
(313,7)(498,7)fter the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and
(57,10)ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with
her(875,6)gift—a(882,6)-cap for Stubb,(411,6)econd(698,6) her
brother-in-law(702,8)spare Bible fo(216,6)steward—(234,6)all this, the
two(1023,8)s, Peleg and Bildad, issued(256,10)cabi(811,7)tu(949,6)to

“Now, Mr.(944,9), are you sur(319,6)ything is right?(576,14)is
all ready—just spoke to him—no(62,6)more to be go(437,7)shore, eh?
Well, c(982,6)l hand(262,6)n. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”

“No need of profane words, however great the hurry(335,7),” said
(338,8)“but away with thee, friend(289,12)nd do our bidding.”

How now! Here(750,10)very point of starting(512,9)voyage,(915,8)
(486,10)(933,8)(494,6)(1010,6)going it(159,6)a high hand (860,6)

well as to all appearances in port. And, as for(527,13), no sign
of him was yet(507,7)seen; only,(147,6)said he was i(306,6)cabin. But
then(867,6)idea was, that his presenc(60,6)by no means necessary in
getting(936,6)hip under weigh(921,6)steering her well out to sea. Indeed,
as(122,6)was not at(681,6)is proper business, bu(619,6)pilot’s;(1024,6)s he
(63,8)yet completely recovered—so(281,10)—therefor(545,10) Ahab
stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially (362,9)

considerable time after heaving up the anchor(282,6)remain over the
cabin table, h(55,6)a farewell merry-making(919,9)ir shore(925,7)s,

“Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he crie(910,6)the sailors lingered at
(189,6)in-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”

“Strike(171,6)en(293,7)!”—w(100,7)next order. As I hinted (389,6), this
whalebone marque(358,7)ever pitched except in port(809,6)on board the
Pequod(371,6)thirty years, the(131,6) to s(177,15)was(971,6)known

“Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump(276,16)(461,7), and
the crew sprang(196,7)e handspikes.

of psalmody, to che(111,7)hands at the windlass, who roared forth some
so(537,6)a chorus abou(59,6)girls in Booble Alley(547,7)hearty good
will. Nevertheless, not three days previous,(622,7) had told them that
no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in
(826,19); and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice
copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.

Meantime, overseeing the(798,7)(888,16), Captain(869,6) ripped
and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he
(302,6)sink(997,9) befor(809,6)(619,6) c(340,8)got up; involuntarily I
paus(363,6)my(586,6)pike(675,6)told Queequeg to do(870,6)ame, thin(760,6)f
the perils we both ran, in starting o(227,6)voyage(598,6)such a devil for
(1020,7). I was comfo(62,6)myself, however(663,7)the(276,9)that in
pious(632,8)might be found some salvation, spite of(548,6)even hundr(419,8)eventy-(8,6)h lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,
and turning round, was horrified(950,8)apparition of(563,15)in
the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my
first kick.

“Is(307,6)the way they heave(654,9)archant service?” he roared.
“Spring, thou sheep-head; s(25,7)and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye
(45,8)I say, all of ye—(70,6)! Quohog!(86,9)thou chap(515,10)red

alo(128,6) windlass, here(853,6)here us(449,12)very freely, while
imperturbable(718,8)kept lead(887,6)(526,6) his psalmody. Thinks I,
(583,14)must have been dr(958,7)something to-day.

At las(666,7)nchor was up,(1023,7)(1000,6)re set(487,6)off we glided. It
was a short, cold Christmas; and as(78,6)hort northern day merged into
night, w(962,8)ourselves almost broad upo(692,6)wintry ocean, whose
freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of
teeth (104,7)bulwarks glistened(822,9)oonlight(231,6)like(868,6)hite
ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from
the bows.

Lank(544,7), as pilot, headed the (1015,6)watch(916,6)ever(387,6)non, as
the old craft deep div(388,7) the(814,7)seas(787,7)en(545,6)shivering
frost(961,6)ver her(830,6)(777,8)s howled(22,10)cordage rang, his
steady note(611,7)heard,—


_“Sweet fields beyo(94,7)swelling flood, Stand dress(408,6)living
green. So (214,7)Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.”_



Never did those sweet words sound mor(23,7)ly to me than then. They
were full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in(523,7)isterous Atlantic, s(62,8)my wet feet and wetter jacket, there
was yet, it then seemed(186,6), many a pleasant haven in store; and
meads and glades so eternally vernal, tha(569,6)grass shot up by the
spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.

At last we gained such an offing(116,11)two(801,6)(605,7)needed no
longe(1014,7)stout sail-boat(179,6)had accompanied us began ranging
alongside.

It was curiou(276,6)not unpleasing, how Peleg and(961,7)(754,6)affected
at(506,6)juncture, especially Captain(1019,7). For loath to depart, yet;
very(27,10)leave, for good, a ship bound on so lon(151,6)perilous a
voyage—(886,7)both stormy Capes;(72,8)in which some thousands of his
hard earned dollar(1000,7)invested(73,8),(74,10)an old shipmate
sailed as c(261,6); a man almost a(980,6)as he, once(910,7)tarting to
encounter all(540,6)errors(880,6)e pitiless jaw;(346,10)say good-bye to
a thing so every way brimful of(21,7)interest to him,—poor ol(505,8)
lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the
cabin to speak another farewell word(1008,6); again came on deck, and
look(1016,6)windward; (20,9)wards the wide and endless waters, only
bounded(982,7) far-off unseen Eastern Continents(99,20)
lan(124,10)aloft(138,9)right and le(23,11)everywhere and
now(236,7)nd at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,
convulsively grasped stout(954,7)(223,7)hand, and holding up a lantern,
for a moment stood gazing hero(138,7)in his face, as much as(628,7),
“Nevertheless, friend(136,6), I can stand it; yes(21,7).”

As for(180,7)himself, he took it(798,6)like a philosopher; but for all
his(29,10)y,(584,6) was a tear twinkling(204,8)eye, when the(271,8)
came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from (731,9)deck—now
a(719,6)below(382,6)now (22,7)with Starbuck, the chief mate.

But,(531,10)he turn(759,6)his comrade,(890,7) final sort of look about
him,—“Captain(973,7)—come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard
there! Boat ahoy! Stan(833,6)o come close alongside, now! Careful,
c(9,6)!(126,7)(139,6), boy—say your last. Luck to ye,(291,9)—l(21,6)

all—and this day three years I’ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in
old Nantucket. Hurrah(968,6)way!”

“God bless ye(894,7)ave(64,6) His holy keeping, men,” murmured old
(292,8)almost incoherently. “I hope ye(180,9)fine weather now, so
that (513,8)Ahab may soon be moving among ye—a pleasant sun is all he
needs(711,6)(114,11)plenty of them i(842,6)tropic voyage ye(597,6)e(515,8)(39,8)hunt, ye mates. Don’t stave the boats needlessly, ye

thought. If ye touch at the islands(941,11), beware of fornication.

“Come, come,(878,9)(960,6); stop palavering,—away!” and(123,8)at,
Peleg hurried him over(592,6)ide(893,6)both dropt in(423,7)boat.

Ship(36,7)at diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
screaming gull flew overhea(74,7)two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
(879,6)heavy-hearted cheer(314,7)blindly plunged like fate(209,10)lone

CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.

Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
mariner, encountered in New Bedford(707,9)nn.

When on(647,6)shi(474,6) winter’s(357,6), the Pequod thrust her vindictive
bows(457,10)cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her
helm but(243,11)! I looke(610,7)sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
the man(114,6)in mid-(210,6) just (301,6) from a four years’ dangerous
voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another
tempestuous term(494,6)land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest
things are e(835,8)unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;
this six-inch(608,8) is(912,6)toneless grave of(623,11). Let me only
say(550,6)it far(401,8)him as(1023,8)e storm-tossed ship, that
miserably drives along(806,6)eeward land(791,6)port would fain give
succor(957,6)port is pitiful; in(24,13)safety, comfort,
hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our
mortalities. But(117,6)at gale(804,6)por(814,7)land,(359,6)(858,6)p’s
direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of(81,6)
though it but graze the keel,(307,7)make her shudder through and
(12,7). With(115,6)er might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,
fights ’gainst the very wind(245,7)fain(454,7)blow her homeward; seeks
(363,6)e lashed sea’s landlessness(867,6); for refuge’s sake forlornly
rushing into peril; her only(470,7) her bitterest foe!

Know ye now,(760,11)? Glimpses do ye seem to see of(774,6)(525,6)ly
intolerable truth;(807,6)all deep, earnest thinking is bu(308,6)intrepid
effort(95,6)e soul to keep the open independence of(484,6)ea; while the
wildest(391,7)of heaven and earth conspire to cast(298,7) the
treacherous, slavish(510,6)?

But as in(416,15)lone resides highest(266,6),(570,6)less,
indefinite as God—so, better is it (446,7)sh(858,9)howl(474,6)(59,6),
than be ingloriously d(574,6)up(200,6) lee, even i(431,7)were safety! For
worm-lik(953,6)n, oh! who(836,7)craven crawl to land! Terrors(422,7)
terrible! i(818,6)this agony so vain? T(910,6)art, t(12,11)O
(626,10)! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from(536,6)pray(644,6)y
ocean-(306,6)ing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!


CHAPTER 24. The Advocate.

As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked(415,6)is business of whaling;
and as(33,25) has somehow come to be regarded among
landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I
am all anxiety to convince ye, ye (105,8),(892,8)injustice hereby
done to us hunte(513,6)whales.

I(628,6)first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
the fact,(760,6)among people at larg(682,6)(339,21)is not
accounted on a level with what are called(805,6)iberal professions. If a
stranger(822,6)introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,
it(844,7)but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were
he presented to the company(539,6)harpooneer, say; and if in emulation
(475,7)naval officers he should appen(279,6)initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale
Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure(257,8)(519,8)
pre-eminently presumin(879,6)ridiculous.

Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us
whalemen, i(907,6): they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a
butchering sort of(1012,9)(361,6)that when actively engag(612,6)rein, we
are surrounded by all manner of defilements. B(117,6)s we are(787,7)is
true. But (152,7)s, also, and(20,9)(968,8)bloodiest badge have been
all Martial Commanders whom(344,11)invariably deligh(277,6)honor. And
as for the matt(203,6)the alleged uncleanl(945,9)our(961,9), ye
shall soon b(636,8)t(874,8)certain facts hitherto pretty(830,8)ly
unknown(263,6)which, upon(549,6)hole, will triumpha(638,6)lant the sperm(563,6)-ship at least among(884,6)(201,6)est thing(359,7)is tidy earth. But
even granti(60,8)harge in question to be true; what disordered
slippery decks of a (157,12)re comparable to the unspeakable
carrion(521,6)ose battle-fields from(295,6) so many soldiers return to
drink in all ladies’ plaudits? And i(617,6)idea of peril so much
enhances the popular conceit(675,8)(119,7)’s profession; let me assure
ye(869,6)many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would
quickly recoil a(504,6)apparit(299,9)(522,7)(365,6)’s vast tail,
fanning(664,6)eddi(217,7)air over his head. For(467,6)are the
comprehensible terro(935,6)man(459,7)ed with(336,6)nterlinked(45,9)and
wo(936,6)of God!

But, thoug(57,6)(952,6)scouts at us(568,6) hunters, yet does it
unwittingly pay u(427,7)rofoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps(923,6)candles(464,6)burn
round the globe, burn, as before(673,10)hrines, to our glory(259,6) look(467,6)is matter in other lights; weigh it(722,8)sorts of
scales; see(906,6)we(878,6)men are(187,6)have been.

Why di(183,6)Dutch in De Witt’s time(48,6)admirals(751,7)ir whaling
fleets? (75,8)Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit
out(83,8) ship(988,7)Dunkirk(373,6)politely invite to(848,6)town some
score or two of familie(77,7)our own island of Nantucket(192,9)
Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to he(267,6)emen in bounties
upwards of £1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it(586,6)(433,12)of
America now outnumber(663,9)rest(1006,8)banded(138,13)(839,9);
sail a navy of (155,11)seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen
thousand men; yearly consuming 4(227,8) of dollars; the(462,7)worth,
at(850,6)ime of sailing, $20(292,8)! and every year importing in(820,6)
harbors a well reaped harv(276,7)$7(371,8). H(359,9)(977,6)is, if
there be not something puissant in(740,8)?(925,6)this is no(197,6)half;(947,7)gain.

I freely assert,(672,7)he cosmo(705,6) philosopher cannot, for his life,
point out one single peaceful influence, which with(498,7)last sixty
(694,6)has operated more potentially upo(554,7)hole broad(566,6), taken
in one aggregate, tha(791,6)high and mighty business of(972,8). One way
and another, it has begotten events so remarkable(708,7)mselves, and so
continuously momentous(753,7)ir sequ(223,6) issues(389,7)(460,7) may
well be regarded as(896,6)Egyptian m(169,7)who bore offspring(148,11)

CHAPTER 25. Postscript.

In behalf(832,8)(967,11)(1017,7), I would fain advance naught but
substantiated facts. But (448,6)embattling his(32,6), an advocate who
should wholly suppress a not(555,12)e surmise,(598,7)(596,6)tell
eloquently(539,6)his cause—such(115,12),(211,7)he(654,7)
blameworthy?

It is well know(951,7)at the coronation of kings and queens, even
modern ones, a certain curious process of season(726,6)em for their
functions is g(708,6)rough. There is a saltcellar of state, so called,
(589,7)re may be a casto(47,10). How they use the salt,
precisely—who knows? C(202,7)I am, however,(289,7) king’s head is
solemnly oiled at(404,6)(321,9)(301,6) as a(52,6)of salad. Can it be,
though(100,7)they anoint it with a view of making its interior run
well, as(63,13)machinery? Mu(587,9)be ruminated here,
concer(420,8) essential(815,12)this regal(477,8), because in
common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who(241,7)s
his hair, and palpably smells(965,6)at(287,7)ing. In truth, a mature man
who use(77,6)-oil, unless medicinally(470,7)man has probably got a
quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t amount to
much(61,6)s totality.

Bu(874,6)only thing to be consider(410,8) is this—what kind of oil is
us(627,6)(944,10)(703,10)ly it can(1023,6) olive oil, nor macassar
(18,9)(820,8)(34,8)bear’s(50,10)train(65,10)cod-liver oil.
W(698,7)n c(727,6)possibly be, but sperm(186,6)n its unmanufactured,
unpolluted(997,8)the sweetest of all oils?

Think(527,8), ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and
queens(864,6)(945,10) stuff!


CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.

The chief mate(804,6)e Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket(740,6)a
Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man(793,6)though born on an
icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being
hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transpor(82,7)the Indi(72,8)live blood
would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been(206,6)in some time
of(867,9)drought and famine, or upon on(382,7)ose fast days for which
his(597,6) is famous. Only(108,7)hirty arid summers had he seen;(90,6)
(27,12)dried up all his physical superfluousness. (1005,6)i(364,6)
thinness, so to speak(436,9)no more the token of wasting anxieties
and cares, th(881,6)(501,7)the indic(718,6)of any bodily blight. It was
merely the condens(53,9)the man(649,9)by no means ill-looking;
quit(175,6)contrary. His pure tight skin(718,6)n excellent fit; and
closely wrapp(340,6)in i(798,7)embalmed(936,6)inner health and strength,
like a revivified Egyptian, thi(909,10)(799,8)prepar(795,13)for
long ages to come(881,7)(832,9)always, as now; for be it Polar snow
or tor(592,6)n,(766,6)a patent chronometer(896,6)interior vitality was
warran(957,7)do(976,6)in all climates. L(394,6) into his eyes, you(596,7)
to see the(601,7)yet lingering images(832,10)thousand-fold perils he
had calmly confro(155,6)hrough life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life
for(606,6)ost part(539,6) telling pantomime of action(522,6)not a tame
chapter of sounds. Yet, for(912,9)hardy sobriety and fortitude,(269,6)
were certain qualities in him which at times affected(664,6)in some
cases(958,8)well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly
conscientious(192,6) seama(245,7)endu(765,8)a deep natural reverence,
the wild watery loneliness of his life did(518,6)fore strongly incline
him to superstition; but to that sort of(34,13),(295,7)(272,8)organization(280,6)s rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
(23,6)gnorance. Outward portents(387,7)(20,6)resentiments were his. And
if(448,10)these things bent the welded iron(300,8)soul, much more
did his far-away domestic memori(829,6)his young Cape wife and child,
tend to bend him still more(261,6)the original rugged(449,12)nature,
and ope(674,6)(68,6)fur(352,8)(962,6)latent influences(715,6),(693,9)honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil da(443,8) often
evinced by others (61,7)more perilous vicissitud(296,6)the fishery. “I
will have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a
whale.” By this, he(916,8)to mean, not only(716,6)(169,6)st reliable and
useful courage was(762,6)(740,6)arises(431,10)fair estimati(576,6)the
encountered(263,6),(838,6)hat an utterly fearless(245,6)s a far(626,7)angerous comrad(790,6) a coward.

“Aye, aye(292,10)ubb, the second mate, “(317,10)there, is as
careful a man as you’ll find anywhere(466,6)is(433,9)” But we shall
ere long see w(343,6)at word “(98,7)” precisely means when us(571,6)a
man like(195,8)or almost an(603,7) whale hunter.

(529,8) was no crusader after(636,6)s; i(806,6)(462,12)not a
sentiment; but a thing simply (517,7)to him, and always at hand upon
a(959,6)tally practical occasions. Beside(654,6)thought, perhaps,(647,6)in
this busi(1007,8)whaling,(647,13)one(830,8)great staple outfits
(858,7)ship,(335,6)her beef and(13,6)read(208,6)not to be foolishly
wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering fo(407,7)s(374,6)
sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish(903,7)oo much(44,8)ed
(43,12)him. For,(320,8) (719,10)I am (678,13)critical
ocean to kill(166,8)for my living(263,16)kill(657,6)them for
theirs; and(956,6)hundreds of men had been s(105,6)ed(158,9) well knew.
What doom was his own father’s?(368,6),(875,6)e bottomless deeps, could
he(923,6)the torn limbs of his brother?

With memories(856,6)these(781,7), and, moreover, given to a certain
superstitiousness, as has(238,7)aid; the(857,9)of(384,6)(919,10)hich
could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have(338,6)extreme. But
it(955,9)in reasonable nature(841,6)a man so organize(746,7)with such
terrible experiences and remembra(17,6)s(759,7); (120,14)(109,6)
(694,6)hese things should fail in latently engend(813,6)an element in
him,(292,6), under suitable circumstances, would break out from its
confinement(978,6)burn all his(409,9)up. And brave(219,7)might be, it
was(904,6)sort of(42,6)ry chiefly, visible in some intrepid men(197,8)
while generally abiding firm(729,8)conflict(402,7)eas, or winds, or
(935,6), or any(597,6)e ordinary irrational horrors(35,8)world, yet
canno(99,6)st(953,6)ose more terrific, becau(23,8)spiritual terrors,
which sometimes menace you(385,6)(207,7)centrating brow of an enraged
and(364,6)y man.

But were(827,7)ming narrative to reveal in any in(518,6),(48,8)plete
abas(585,6)of poor(886,9)’s fortitude, scarc(494,8)I(859,6)the heart
to write it; for it is a(724,6) most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose
the fall of valour(494,8)soul. Men may seem detes(742,6)as joint
stock-compani(911,7)nations; knaves, fools(974,6)murderers there may be;
m(105,7)have mean(46,6)eagre faces; but man,(657,8)ideal, is so noble
and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature,(832,6)over any
ignominious blemish in him(926,9)fellows should run to throw their
costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so
far(25,8)us(170,7)it remains intact though all(882,6)uter character
seem gone; bleeds(962,6)keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a
valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at(372,8)shameful sight,
(771,8)ly stifle her upbraidings agains(136,6)permitting stars. But
this august dignity I treat of, is no(201,6)(31,8)of k(94,6)nd(399,6),
but(503,6)abounding(78,9)which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt
see it shining(826,8)arm(595,6)wields a pick or drives a spike; that
democratic(131,14), on(626,6)ands, radiate(445,6)out end from God;
Himself! The great God absolute(24,6)centre and circumferenc(482,6)ll(140,8)cy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!

If, then, to meanest mariner(1012,7)renegade(386,6)castaways, I shall
hereafter ascribe high (101,6)ies,(738,8)dark; weave round them tragic
graces; if eve(397,6)most mournful, perchance(29,10)abased, among

CHAPTER 27. Knight(1020,6)Squires.

Stubb was(483,6)econd mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
neither craven nor valiant; taking perils (173,6)y cam(593,7)an
indifferent air(162,6)while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner(106,8)
for the year. Good-humored, easy,(79,6)areless, he presided(963,6)his
whale-boat as if(189,10)deadly encounter were but a dinner(97,6)his
crew all invited guests(479,10)s particular about the comfortable
arrangement of hi(52,6)(309,7) boat, as an old stage-driver is(85,6)
the snugness(70,8)box. When close to the whale,(432,8)very
death-lock(118,8)fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and
off-handedly(175,6) whistling tink(376,6) hammer(768,6)ould hum(406,10)old rigadig tunes(613,7)flank and(10,7)with(623,10)exasperated
monster. Long(811,6) had, (566,6)is Stubb, converted the jaws of death
into an easy chair. What he thought(45,9) itself, there is no
telling. Whether he ever(62,12)it at all, might be a question;
but, if(59,9)did chance to cast his mind that way after a
(609,11)(693,9)no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a
so(647,6)call(655,8)watch to tumble aloft(882,6)bestir themselves(275,6),
(760,6)something which h(514,8)find out when he obey(408,7)ord(880,7)
not sooner.

What, perhaps,(528,6)other things, made(492,6) such(463,8)-going,
unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off(618,10)burden of life in a
world fu(287,6)grave pedlars, all bowed(889,8)ground(700,9)ir packs;
w(603,6)lp(44,6)bring(984,6)(473,6)almost impious good-humor(1002,7); that
(349,6)must have been his pipe. For(506,7)his nose, his short, black
little pipe was one(506,8)regular features(125,7) face. You(977,6)
(174,7)as soon(139,6)expected him(573,6)rn out(68,8)bu(981,7)out his
nose as(20,12)(199,7)He kept a whole row of pip(625,8) ready
loaded, stuck in a rack(557,6)i(989,7)reach(202,8)hand; and, whenever
he turned in, he smok(669,6)m all out in succession, lighting one from
the(671,8)(524,6)end(850,8)chapter; then loading(96,7)gain(911,7)in
readiness anew(466,7)when(744,7)dressed, instead of first putting his
legs into his trowsers, he p(362,11)(35,10)mouth.

I say this continual smok(631,19)one cause, at least,(686,7)
peculiar disposition; for every one knows(766,6)this earthly air,
whether ashore or afloat, is terribly inf(628,6)(963,9)nameless
miseri(707,6)the numberless mortals who(838,6)died exhaling it; and as in
tim(799,9)cholera, some people go(968,7)with a camphorated
handkerchief(535,7)ir(365,6)s; so(941,6)wise,(521,6)st all(162,7)
tribulations,(513,6)’s tobacco(678,6) migh(406,7)operated as a sort of
dis(295,6)ing agent.

The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A
short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,
who somehow seemed(834,6)ink(542,8)e great leviathans had personally
and hereditarily affronted him(465,6)therefore it w(293,12) point of
honor(591,6)him, to destroy(943,6)whenever encountered. So utterly lost
was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvel(682,8)ir majestic
bulk and mystic ways(669,6)so dead to anything like an apprehension of
any possible danger from(196,10)ing them;(911,6)in his poor opinion,
the wondrous(444,6) was but a spec(877,7)magnified mouse, or at least
water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention(236,7)me small
applicat(218,6) time(475,6)rouble in order to kill and boil. This
ignorant, uncons(661,6)fearlessness of his made him(153,10)waggish in
(443,6)tter of(713,7); he followed these fish(492,9)fun of it(654,6)a
three years’ voyage round Cape Horn was(288,8)jolly joke(791,6)lasted
(12,6)ength(275,8). As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought
(31,7)nd cut(45,6); so mankind may be similarly(70,8). L(438,6)Flask
(174,6)e(714,7)(94,8) ones;(338,6)to clinch tight and last long. They
call(952,6) King-Post on board(92,8)Pequod; because, in form, he could
be well likened to the short, square timber known by(769,6)name in
Arctic(750,6)r(890,7)which(42,6)e mean(758,7)ny radiating sid(91,8)s
insert(371,8)it, serves to brace(151,7)ip against the icy concussions
of those bat(948,7)seas.

Now(625,7)(595,6)mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and(424,6), were momentous men.
They it was who by universal prescription commanded(112,7)(495,6)
(403,6)’s boats as headsmen. In(693,6)grand(932,7)of batt(951,6)which
Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forc(321,6)descend on the
(908,6),(271,13)(134,8)(246,6)as c(102,6)s of companies. Or, being
armed with their long keen whaling spear(105,6)y(89,9)a picked trio
of lancers; even as the harpooneers(393,6)flingers of javelins.

And since in this famous fishery, each mate or(365,7)an, like a Gothic
Knight of old, is always ac(253,8)d by hi(442,6)-steerer or(171,11),
who in certain conjunctures provides him(312,6)a fresh(258,6), whe(417,6)former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed(249,6)e assault; and
moreover,(336,7)re generally subsists betwe(116,6) two, a close intimacy
and friendliness; it i(83,7)fore but meet,(700,6)(390,8)place we set
down who the (770,9)(483,16)(893,6)to what(426,9)(448,6)of
them belonged.

First of all was Queequeg, whom (987,10)the chief mate, had selected
for his squire. But(74,9)(520,6)ready known.

Nex(1023,6)Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head(129,6)most westerly
promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where(442,7)still exist(797,6)last
remnan(258,6) village of red men, which has(922,6)supplied the
neighboring island of Nantucket(983,6)many of her(191,6)daring
(924,11). I(638,6)(879,9)they usually go by th(638,7)ic name of
Gay-Headers.(331,9)’(171,6), lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,
and black rounding eyes—for an(398,7), Oriental(811,7)ir largeness, but
Antarctic(34,10)glittering expression—all(736,6)sufficient(462,6)claimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood(24,6)ose proud
warrior hunters, who, in que(743,6)the great New England moos(723,6)

hunted(69,8)wake(198,14)whale(137,9)sea;(297,7)erring (614,7)
(33,8)on fitly replacing the infallible arrow(81,9)ires. To look
at(204,6)awny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have
credit(833,6) superstitions of som(225,9)earlier Puritans, and
half-believed(582,6)wild(678,7) to be a son(565,8)Princ(311,9)Powers(272,8)Air(825,10) was Stubb(333,7)cond mate’s squire.

Third amo(315,7)(968,11) was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
negro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus(211,6)hold. Suspended
from his ears were two golden hoops, so(931,6) th(442,7)sailors called
them ring-bolt(354,6)(436,7)talk of secur(551,8)top-sail halyards to

CHAPTER 28. Ahab.

For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was
seen of Captain(91,6) The mates regularly relieved(839,6)other at the
w(81,6)(677,6)for aught(587,6)could be seen(346,8)contrary, they seemed
to be the only commander(777,10)hip;(29,6)(56,6)ometimes issued(836,6)the cab(400,8)orders so sudden and perempto(131,6)at(315,7)all it was
pla(830,6)y but(141,9)d vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and
dictator was(456,6), though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to
penetrate in(666,7)now sacred retreat(728,8)cabin.

Every time I ascended(729,8)deck from my (445,7) below, I instantly
gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
disquietude touching the unknown c(637,6), now (374,6) seclusion(946,7)
sea, became almost a perturbation. This was(160,8)ly heightened at
(557,6)by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
recurring to me,(1011,7) subtle energy I(758,7)not have before conceived
of. But poorly(805,7)I withstand them, much as in(881,7)moods I was
(261,7)ready to smile(915,7) solemn whimsicalitie(840,7)at outlandish
prophe(576,9)wharves(158,6)whatever(788,7) of apprehensiveness or
uneasiness—to c(837,7)so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look
about me(510,9)hip, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
emotions. For(876,8)the harpooneers(435,7)the great body(830,9)rew,
were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than an(75,8)
tame merchant-ship companies (281,6)my previous experi(625,6)had made me
acquainted with, still(980,6)ribed this—and rightly(26,10)it—(1009,6)
fierce uniqu(439,7)(495,6)very nature(541,9)wild Scandinavian vocation
in(187,7)I had so abandonedly embarked(731,6)(564,7)especially the
aspec(622,9)three chief officer(155,9)(515,6)the mates,(309,7)was
most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and
induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentmen(807,9)voyage.
Three better,(558,6)likely sea-(211,9)and men, each in his own
different way, could no(982,6)ily be found(624,6)they were(154,7)one of
them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyard(14,6)Cape man. Now, it being
Christmas whe(904,10) shot from out her harbor, for a space we had
biting Polar weather,(908,8)all(504,6)ime running away(95,6)it (689,7)southward; and by(395,7)degre(428,6)minute of latitude(546,8)e sailed,
gradually leaving(738,6)merciless win(291,6)nd all its intolerable
(193,7) behind us. I(728,6)(379,6) those less lowering, but(936,7)grey
and gloomy enough morning(903,9)transition,(380,6)with a fair wi(506,6)
ship was rush(205,6)rough the water(56,8)vindictive sort of leaping
(651,6)lancholy rapidity,(1020,6)as I moun(846,7)the deck at the call(626,7) forenoon watch, so soon(68,6)levelled my glance towards the
taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;
Captain Ahab stood upo(863,6)quarter-deck.

There seemed no sign of common bodily il(1020,6)about him, nor(1014,7)
recover(686,7)any. He looked like a man cut(726,11)the stake(476,6)(316,6)ire has over(777,7)ly waste(650,6)the limbs without consum(709,6)em,
or tak(834,9)one particle(121,9)ir compacted aged robustness. His
whole high, broad form,(298,8)made of solid bronze(815,6)shaped in an
unalt(820,6) mould,(272,6)Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out
(343,6)mong his grey hairs(929,6)continuing right down one si(166,6)his
tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappear(195,6)his clothing, you
saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that
perpendicular seam sometimes(342,6)in(539,7)raight, lofty trunk of a
great tre(571,7) the upper lightning tear(574,6)darts(277,6)it, and
(572,8)wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves ou(1003,6)bark from
top to bottom, ere (691,7) off into(741,6)oil, leav(677,7) tree still
greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with(904,6)or
w(40,7)it was(857,6)car left by some desperate wound, no one could
certainly say. B(53,7)taci(866,6)ent, through(267,8)voyage little or
no allusion wa(464,7)to it, especially by the mates. But once
Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian(780,7)the crew,
superstitiously assert(627,7) not(736,6)he was full forty years old did
Ahab become(372,6)way(398,8)(989,6)then it came upon(388,6)not(695,7)
fury of any mortal fray(474,6)in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this
wild hint seemed inferent(321,6)negatived, by what a grey Manxman
insinuat(185,6) old sepulchral man, who, h(661,6)never before sailed out
of Nantucket, had(42,7)ere this laid ey(269,7)wild Ahab. Nevertheless,
the(132,7)a-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested
thi(430,6)(231,7)(775,6)preternatural powers of discernment. So(525,8)
whit(230,6)or ser(565,7)contradicted him when he sai(586,7)if ever
Captain Ahab should be tranquilly(280,6)out—which might hardly (608,6)o
pass, so he muttered—the(412,6)ever(92,8)d(189,7)last office for the
dead, would find a birth-mark (674,6) from crown to sole.

So(301,6)fully did the whole grim aspect of(233,6)affect me(780,9)
livid(803,6) (234,6)streaked it,(895,6)(169,7) first few moments I(274,7)
no(941,13)a little of(614,6)overbearing grimness was owing to the
barbaric (481,6)leg(662,7)hich he partly stood. It had prev(514,9)me
to (1023,8)this ivory leg had(939,7) been fashioned(351,6)the polished
bon(191,7)e sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said(824,9)Gay-Head Indian once; “but like hi(71,12)craft, he shipped
another mast without coming hom(590,6)it. He has a quiver of ’em.”

I was struck(888,6)the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of
the Pequod’s quarter deck(598,6)pretty close(473,7) mizzen shrouds,
ther(315,6)an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, in(555,7)plank. His bon(556,6)steadied in(1006,6)hole; one arm elevated, and
holding by a(153,7); Captain(814,6)stood erect, looking straight out
beyo(840,6) ship’s ever-pitching prow. T(237,12)infinity of firmest
fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness,(229,6)e fixed and
fearless, forward dedication(905,6)at glance. Not a word he spoke; nor
did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest
gestures and expressions, they plainly showe(315,6)uneasy, if not
painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not
only that, but moody stricke(479,13)before them(788,6)a crucifixion
in his face; in(241,8) nameless regal overbearing dig(481,8)some
mighty woe.

Ere long, from(92,6)irst visit(468,8)air, he withdrew(759,6)his cabin.
But after(744,6)morning(52,6)a(646,6)y day visibl(904,9)crew; either
standing (229,7)pivot-(904,6)or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or
heavily walking the deck. As(793,6)ky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to
grow a little genial, he became still(68,6)and(9,7) recluse; as if,
whe(790,6)ship had sailed(366,7)ome, nothing but(174,7)ad wintry
bleak(623,8)the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it
came to pass,(888,6)(410,7)almost continually(500,11); but, as yet,
for(865,7)(64,6)said, or perceptibly did, o(567,7)t last sunny deck, he
seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. B(278,7)Pequod was only
making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling
preparatives needing supervisi(194,7)mates were fully competent to, so
that(188,7)was(560,8)or(471,8), out of himself, to employ or excite
Ahab,(195,6)and thus chase away, fo(858,7)one interval,(835,6)louds that
layer(802,6)(11,6)were pil(824,8)his brow, (918,7) all(67,8)choose
the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.

Nevertheless, ere long(154,6)warm, warbling persuasive(721,11)
pleasant, holiday weather we (696,7), (563,7)grad(677,6)to charm him
(845,6)is mood. For, as (893,9)red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and
May, trip ho(815,6)the(905,7), misanthropic woods; ev(990,7)barest,
ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some
few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,
(968,7)end, a(665,8)respond(222,8)playful alluring(407,7)at girlish
air. More than once did he put(184,7)the faint blossom of a look,
which, in any (988,8)n, would have soon flowered out in a smile.


CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.

Some days elapsed, and ice(8,8)bergs all astern(837,6)Pequod now went
rolling throug(225,6)bright Quito spring, (221,7)at sea, almost
perpet(682,6)reigns o(651,6)threshold(768,7) eternal August(790,8)Tropic. T(839,7)ly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
up—flaked up, with rose-water snow(159,6)starred and stately nights
(950,7)haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at(893,6)in lonely
pride(421,6)memory(313,7)ir absent conquering Earls(466,6)golden helmeted
suns! For sleeping(645,6)’twas hard to choose between(877,6)wins(599,8)
and(899,6)seducing(236,7). But all the witcherie(848,10)unwaning
weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies(943,8)outward
world. Inward they turned up(617,7)soul, especially whe(26,7)till mild
hours of eve came on; then,(366,8)shot her(571,8)s as the(650,6) ice
most forms of noiseless twil(285,7)And(285,8)se subtle ag(222,6), more
and more(208,6)wrought on Ahab’s texture.

Old age is always wakeful; as if(980,6)longer linked(705,6)lif(588,7)less
man has to do(739,6)aught(434,6)looks like death. Among sea-commanders,
the old greybeards will oftenest leave(692,7)berths to visit the
night-cloaked deck. It was s(151,7)Ahab; only(590,6)now, of late, he(875,8)so much to live i(525,6)open air,(652,6)truly speaking, his(143,6)s
were(390,7)(627,6)cabin, than from(21,10)(661,8)planks. “It feels
like going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an
old captain(389,6)me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
grave-dug(378,6).”

So, almost every twenty-four hours,(813,10)watch(967,8)e(1005,6) were
set, and the band on deck sentinelle(29,6)slumbe(873,6)(45,9)below;
and(922,6)if a rope w(658,6)be haul(980,12)forecas(229,6)he sailors
flung it not rudely down, as by day, but(773,6)some cautiousness dropt
it to its place for fear of disturb(371,6)eir(212,8)ing shipmates; when
this sort of steady quietud(502,8)beg(576,6)prevail, habitually, the
silent steersman(559,7)watch(664,10)-(500,7); and er(1013,6)(755,6)ld
(56,10)emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled
way. Some consid(246,6)touch of humanity was in him; for at times like
these, he usually abstained(856,6)patroll(355,7) quarter-deck; because
to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six in(702,8)his ivory
heel, such(900,7)have be(754,7)reverberating crack and din(774,6)at bony
step,(16,6)(532,6)dreams(85,17)(701,7)crunching teeth of
sharks. But onc(726,7)mood was on him too deep for common regardings(835,6)as(732,6)heavy, (881,6)-like pace h(855,6)measu(447,6)he ship from
taffrail to mainmast, Stubb(874,6)old secon(372,6), came u(63,6)(972,6),
with a certain unassured, deprec(338,6)humor(890,7), hinted(342,6)if
Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say
nay; but there might be(1016,6)way of muff(619,9)noise; hinting
something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the
insertion into it,(574,6)e(646,6) heel. Ah!(359,10)ou didst not know
Ahab then.

“Am I a cannon-ball(419,8)” said Ahab, “(658,7)ou(1020,6)st wad me that
fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below t(33,6)nightly grave;
where(834,6)as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye(72,6)e fi(993,6)one at
last.—Down, dog(317,6)kennel!”

Starting (866,6) unforseen concluding exclamatio(927,7)e so suddenly
scornful old man(726,7) was speechless a moment; then(335,6)excitedly,
“I am not u(653,7)be spoken(291,6)at way, sir; I do but less than half
like it, sir.”

“Avast! gritte(448,6)(325,9)his set teeth(599,6)violently moving away,
as if to avoid(743,6)passionate temptation.

“No(165,7)not yet(572,8)(1004,7)emboldened, “I will not tamely be
called a(433,6)(202,8)Then be (30,7)ten times a donkey(793,6)a mule(12,7)n ass(817,6)begone,
or I’ll clear the world(826,7)e!”

As he(752,6)this,(310,6)advanced upon him with(675,6)overbearing terrors
i(353,6)aspect,(449,6)(537,6)involuntarily retreated.

“I was never served so before without gi(411,6) hard blow for it,”
muttere(366,9)as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s
very queer. Stop(725,7); somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go
back and strike him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for
him? Yes(328,7)was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the
first time I ever _did_ pray. It’s(241,6); (253,10); and he(28,8)
too; aye, ta(208,6) fore(635,6)ft,(44,6)about the(323,6)est old man(774,6)
(481,6)ailed with. How he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is
he mad? Anyway there’s something o(997,6)mind, as sure (316,6)re must be
(48,13)a deck when it cracks. He aint (726,7)bed(513,6)either,
more than three hours out(857,7) twenty-fou(341,9)(572,7)sleep then.
Didn’t(813,6)Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me(850,6)of a morning he always
find(547,6)(376,7)’s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled,(13,6)he
sheets down a(463,6)foot(33,9) coverlid almost tied into knots, and
the pillow a sort of frightful hot,(403,6)ough a baked brick had been on
it? A ho(587,9)! I guess(672,6)got what some folks ashore call a
conscience; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a
toothache. Well, well; I(454,7)(1021,7)at it is, b(770,7)Lord keep me
from catching it. He’s full of riddles; I wonder(210,6)he goes(347,6)the
after hold for, every nigh(333,6)(571,9) tells me he suspects; what’s
that(65,6)I should(872,6)(449,6)w? Who’s made appointments with him in
the hold? Ai(700,9)queer, now? B(265,6)re’s no telling,(387,6)(675,7)
game—Her(234,7)for a snooze. Damn me(51,7)worth a fellow’s while to be
born(296,9) world, if only to fall right asleep. And now(885,6)I think
of it, that’s abo(462,7)first thing babies do(819,8)(44,6)(741,8)
(261,7)too(195,11)but all(67,6)s are(301,8)come to(129,6) of ’em.
(318,6)(134,6)gainst my principles. Think not, is my eleventh
commandment; and sleep when you can(52,8)twelfth—So h(390,9)again(131,6)how’s that? didn’t h(857,7)me a dog? blazes!(26,8)ed me ten times

well have kicked me(383,6)done(665,6)it. Maybe he _did_ kick(42,9)I
(194,7)observe it, I was so taken all aback(748,8)s brow, somehow. It
flashe(821,7)a bleached bone. Wha(564,6)devil(748,7)matter(833,6)me? I
don’t stand(665,7)on my legs. Coming afoul of(862,6)old man ha(623,8)
of turn(371,6)wrong side out. By the Lord, I must(323,6)been dreaming,
though—How? how? how?—b(763,7)only way’s to stash it; s(563,12)to
hammock(687,6)(632,6)in(253,6)orning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling
thinks over by daylight.”


CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.

When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning(100,6)the
bulwarks(813,6)then, as had(298,6)usual(529,8)m of late, calling a
sailor(425,6)e watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool(789,6)also
his pipe. Lighting the pipe (595,7)binnacle lamp(847,6)lan(43,9)stool
o(374,6)weather(528,7)(154,6)deck(153,6)at and smoked.

In old Norse(952,6), the thrones(219,8)sea-loving Danish kings were
fabricated, saith tradition,(284,8)tusk(78,9)narwhale. How could
one look at(449,6)(400,6)seated on(779,6)tripod of bones, without
bethinking(428,8)the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan(443,8)plank,
and a king(249,11)(427,7) great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.

Some moments passed, during which(349,7)ick vapor came from his mouth
in quick and constant puffs,(71,7)blew ba(888,8) into his face. “How
now,” he soliloquized at last(315,6)draw(625,8)tube, “this smoking no
longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go(813,6)me if thy charm be
gone! Here have I(866,7)nconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and
ignorantly(161,9)to windward all(904,6)hile;(27,12)(878,6)with
such nervous whiffs, as if, like(816,6)y(433,6)ale, my final jet(754,7)(885,6)ronges(849,6)fullest of trouble. What business(248,8)with this
pipe? This th(1014,6)at is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white
vapors among(24,11) hairs(330,6)(28,6)torn iron-grey locks like
mine. I’ll smoke no more—”

He tossed(781,6)till lighted pipe(632,6)(809,7). The fire hissed in the
waves;(848,6)ame i(722,7)the ship shot by the bubbl(391,6)s(978,7)pipe
made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly pac(176,7)planks.


CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.

Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.

“Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s
ivory leg, well I(72,6)ed he kicked me(831,6)it;(687,6)hen I tried to
kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I(81,9)y leg right off! And
then, presto!(317,6)seemed a pyrami(815,7)I(785,7)a blazing fool, kept
kicking at it. But what was(551,7)more curious,(333,6)—y(286,8)how
(28,7) all(342,6)s are—through(974,7)is rage(796,6)I was in, I somehow
(188,7)to be th(562,7)to myself,(854,6)after all, i(165,6)not much of an
insult(46,7)kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’(94,6)s I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not
a real(490,6)only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between
a living thump and a dead(17,6). T(129,6)what makes a blow(183,6)the
hand(376,7), fifty times(409,6)savage(311,6)ar than(66,13)a cane.

playful cudgelling—in fact(565,9)(82,8)(516,6)at he gave me—not a
base kick. Besid(115,16)look(927,6) once; why, the end of it—the

farmer kicked me, _(743,7)_ a devilish(52,7)(876,6). But(994,6)(893,6) is

man(620,6)(792,6)frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next momen(57,7)
over the(66,7)(126,9)m I a(123,12)I at last. ‘And what business
is(892,6)of yours, I (231,6) like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a
kick?’ By the lord(429,7), I had no sooner said that, than he turned
round his stern to me, bent over(374,6)dragging up a lot of seaweed he
had for a clou(773,7)do you(961,6), I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his
(130,6)was stuck full of marlinspikes(570,7)the(724,6)s out. Says I, on
second thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’
said he, ‘w(23,9);’ and kept mu(772,8)it all the time(768,12)eating of his own gums(486,6)a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to
stop saying over his(150,12), (12,11)’ I(251,8) I might as
well fall to kicking(949,12) again. But(573,7)only just lifted my
foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop(733,6)(101,7)!’ ‘Halloa,(796,8),
‘what’s the matter now(399,12)?’ ‘Look ye here(61,8)he; ‘let’s
argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’
(942,6)—‘right _here_ it was.’ ‘Very good(128,10)—‘he use(821,6)ivory

an honor; I consider it (24,8). Listen(706,12). In old England
the(128,6)est lords think it(152,7)glory to be slapp(183,8)quee(179,6)

for you ca(729,6)lp yourself(332,14)Don’t you see(921,6)(1010,7)?’
With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to
swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over(217,6)there I(633,6)n my
hammock! Now(774,7)do(772,6)hink of(398,6)dream, Flask?”

“I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”

“May be; may be. But it’s(465,19) me(115,7). D’ye see Ahab
standing(210,6), sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing
(459,7) do(218,7), is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,
whatever he says. Halloa! What’s(717,6)he shouts? Hark!(265,6)st-head,(408,6)! Look sharp,(535,8)ye! There are whales hereabouts!

“If (283,7)a white one, split your lungs for him!

essayed. Listen to w(742,6)e best and latest authorities have laid down.

“No branch of Zoology(295,6) much involved (841,8)which is entitled

“(391,6)not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry

“Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge(602,9)(259,6).” “A field

Thus speak(848,13), the great Cuvier, and John Hunt(17,8)Lesson,
those ligh(787,6)z(670,7)and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real
(268,10)there be little, yet of books(30,7)are a plenty; and so in
some small degree,(314,6)c(760,8) or the science of(525,6)s. Many are
the men,(73,7)and(267,6), old and new, landsmen(127,6)eamen, who(954,6)at

Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron(574,7); Frederick

what ultimate generalizing purpose a(874,9)have(448,8)(801,6)above
cited extracts will show.

O(983,6)names in this list(632,9) a(487,6), only (840,6)following Owen
ever saw living(689,7)(759,6)but one(958,7)m was a real professional
harpooneer and(998,6)man. I mean Captain(387,9). On(809,6)eparate

(678,9)-ports;(828,6)usurpation has been every way complete. Reference

days,(984,7)atisfy you(548,25), witho(921,7)rival, was
(463,6)m the monarch(562,14)Bu(629,6)time has at last come for a
new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the
(805,19)deposed,—(264,10)(880,11) now(452,6)eth!

There are only two books in being(914,7)at all pretend to p(230,6)
living(100,13)before you(729,6)(901,7)sam(277,6),(423,8)remotest
degree succeed(454,8)attempt. Those(153,7)are Beale’s and Bennett’s;
both(514,7)ir(383,6)surgeons to English South-Sea(666,7)ship(899,7)both
exact and reliable men. The original matter touching(511,6)(360,11)to
be (972,7)(147,8)volumes is necessarily small;(845,7) far as it goes,
it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to(909,11)
descrip(615,6)As yet, however,(185,16),(967,12)or poetic,
lives not(927,9) in any literature. Far above all other hunted
whales, (743,7)an unwritten life.

Now the various species of(915,6)s need some sort of popular
comprehensive classification, if(736,6)an easy outline on(913,6)the
present, hereaf(478,6) be fill(661,6)all its departments by subsequent
laborers. As no better man advances to take this(584,8)in hand, I
hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing(408,9);
because any human (34,6)suppos(544,6)be(457,9), must(264,7)at very
reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical(637,12) of(479,20), or—in(271,6)place at least—to much
of any (714,13)My object here is simply to project the draught of
a systematiza(147,8)cetology. I am the architect, no(70,6)builder.

But (916,6)a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sor(481,7)the
Post-Office is equal to it. To grope down into(122,6)ottom(317,8)sea
(669,7)hem; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations,
ribs, and very pelvis(417,8)world;(672,6)is a fearful(583,6). What am I
that I should essay to hook the nose(503,6)is leviathan! The awful
tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the(72,10)) make a
covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I(316,6)swam
through libraries and sailed (29,8)oceans;(57,8)had to do with
whales(133,9)se visible(408,6);(609,6)in earnest; and I will try. There
are some prelimin(144,6)to settle.

First: The uncertain, un(33,6)d condi(885,10)is science of C(754,7)
is(664,7)(518,6)vestibule attested by the fact, that in(156,6)quarters it
still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of
Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate(692,6)(380,6)from
the(99,6)” But of my own knowledge, I know(211,6)down (878,7)year 1850,
shark(519,7)had, alewiv(538,7)herring, against(171,8)’s express edict,
were (291,6)found dividi(931,7)possess(427,9)e same sea(586,10)
L(827,8).

The grounds upon which(298,9)would fain(733,6)banishe(778,6)(294,16)waters, he states as follows: “On account(156,7)ir warm bilocular
heart,(28,7)lungs(13,8)movable eyelid(23,9)hollow ears, penem
intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure
meritoque.” I submitted all(771,6)to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley
Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a (897,7) voyage, and
they united(869,8)opinion(840,6)the reasons set forth were altogether
insufficient.(162,8) profanely hint(476,6)y(60,6)humbug.

Be it know(113,6), waiving all argument, I tak(836,6)good old fashioned
(617,6)(178,10)(965,6)is(965,7), and call(651,6)holy Jonah to back me.
This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
respect does(139,11)differ from other(1018,6) Above,(790,9)has given
you those items. But in brief,(330,6)are these:(723,6) and(761,7)lood;
whereas, all(119,11) are lungles(53,6)cold(53,6)ed.

Next: how shall we defin(384,6)whale, by his obvious ex(258,6)s, so as
conspicuously to label him for(751,6)ime to come? To be sho(938,7)n, a
(458,9)_a spouting(197,6)with a horizo(431,6)ail_. There you have him.
However contract(463,6)at(216,6)ition i(433,6)result of expanded
meditation. A walrus(142,6)s much like a(282,9)u(646,7)(41,6)is not a
(651,6)because h(673,6)mphibiou(483,7)the last term of th(381,7)(165,8)
still more cogent, as coupled(279,6)the first. Almost any one must have
notice(821,7)all(53,7)sh familiar(437,6)ndsmen(332,6)not a flat(230,6)a
vertical, or up-and-down tail. W(642,9)mong(450,15)the tail,
though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes(509,13)
position.

By the abov(316,13)of(941,6)(425,7) is, I do by no means exclude
from(398,6)eviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
(398,9)(712,6)b(154,6)best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the(947,6)
hand, link(756,6)i(462,6)fish(116,10)authoritatively regarded as
alien.* Hence,(492,9)smaller,(856,9), and(849,16)ed fish
must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now(968,8)come the
grand divisions(737,8)entir(293,8)host.

*I am aware(939,7)own to the present time,(698,10)styled Lamatins and
Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow(13,6)(867,7)Coffi(145,6)(400,9)) are

and feeding on wet hay(440,6)especially(128,7)y do not(886,6), I deny
their credentials as(190,7);(513,6)av(353,9)ed them(633,6)their
passports to quit the Kingdom(514,13)

First: According to magnitude I divide(320,11) into three primary
BOOKS (sub(568,6)ble(39,6)CHAPTERS)(697,6)(371,6)shall comprehe(23,6)m

obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged
upon. It is chiefly with his name(146,6)I now have to do. Philologically
considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the (901,6)whale was
almost wholly un(688,6)in his own proper individuality(700,6)whe(39,7)il
was only accidentally (309,8)(369,6)the stranded fish; in those days

or low, depend for(489,7)profits, not upon fixed wages, bu(22,7)(804,6)common luck, together(548,9)ir (33,7)vigila(645,7)trepidity(211,6)hard work(860,11)l these things do(945,9)cases tend to beget a
less rigorous discipline than in (744,12)generally; yet, n(391,6)ind
how much like an old Mesopotamian(999,6)y(159,7)whalemen may,(163,8)
primitive instances, live(290,9); for(231,7)a(946,7)punctilious
externals, at least,(851,8)(906,7)-deck are seldom materially relaxed,
and in no(138,9) done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in
which you will se(42,6)skipp(939,6)ading his(158,14)with an elated
grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as
much outward homage as if he wo(199,7)imperial purple, and not the
shabbiest of pilot-cloth.

And(646,8)(947,7)men the moody captain(397,8)Pequod was(1006,6)east
given to that sort of shallowest assumption; a(113,10)the only(214,7)
he ever exacted, was implicit,(605,7)taneous obedience(838,9)he
required no man to remov(449,7)hoes from his feet ere stepping(1001,9)
(628,12)(179,16)re were times when, owing to peculiar
circum(782,7) connected(547,6)events hereafter(986,6) detailed, he
addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in
terrorem_, or otherwise; yet even C(476,7)Ahab was by no means
unobservant(906,8)paramount forms and usages(940,8)sea.

Nor, perhaps,(836,6)it fail(233,7)eventually perceived,(574,6)behind
those(103,17), as it were, he some(392,6)masked himself;
incidentally making use(712,7)m f(276,8) and more private ends than
they(493,6)legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of
his brain, which had(401,10) in a good degree remained unmanifested;
thr(823,7)(284,10)(882,6)ame(114,11)became incarnat(97,6)n
irresistible dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what
it will, it can never(995,6)(871,6)practical, available supremacy over
(379,6)men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and
entrenchments, always, in themselves,(468,6)or less paltry and base.
This it is(633,7)for ever keeps God’s true princ(740,10)Empire from
the world’s hustings; and leaves the highest honor(435,7)this air can
give, to(474,7)men who become famous(675,6)(515,10)eir infinite
inf(420,9)to the choice hidden handful(969,8)Divine Inert,(747,8)(90,12)undoubted(511,13)over the dead leve(82,9)mass.
Such large virtue lurks(410,7)se small things when extreme political
superstitions invest them(425,7)in(544,6)royal instances even to idiot
imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, a(167,8) case of
Nichola(453,6)Czar, the ringed crown of geographical e(541,6)encircles an
imperial brain; then(75,6)plebeian herds crouch abased bef(499,6)e

depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,
ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, (327,7)one
now alluded to.

But Ahab, my Captain, still moves(268,8)me in all his Nantucket
grimness and shaggines(906,7)in(878,6)episode touching Emperors and
Kings, I must not conceal(944,6)I(577,6)only to do with a poor old
whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings
and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be gr(233,9)ee, it

CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.

It is noon(395,6)Dough-Boy(842,6)steward, thrusting his pale
loaf-of-bread face(187,10)cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord
and master; who, sitting(1005,8)lee quarter-boat, has just been taking
an observation of(324,6)u(217,7)is now mutely reckoning(98,6)atitude on
the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reser(402,8)that daily purpos(72,9)upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the
tid(758,6)you would think(755,6)moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But
presently, cat(860,6)hold(294,8)mizen shrouds, he swings himself(143,8)deck(657,6)in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr.
Starbuck,” disappears in(238,6)(566,6).

Whe(507,7)ast echo(320,8)sultan’s step has (747,6)way(809,6)(98,9)
the first Emir(565,6)every reas(355,6)suppose(451,6)he is seated, then(176,9) rouses(923,6)his quietude, takes a few turns alo(600,7)planks,
and, after a grave peep(249,10)binnacl(311,6)s, with some touch of
pleasantness(342,14) Stubb,” and descends(958,6)(896,6)(1016,6)second
Emir lounges about the rigging awhi(946,6)d then slightly shak(817,7)
main brace, to see whether it will be all right(208,6)that important
rope, he likewise(331,7)up the old burden(625,6)with a rapid(597,9)
Mr. Flask,” follows(361,7)his predecessors.

B(236,7)third(534,7)now seeing(748,9)all alone o(646,6)quarter-deck,
seems to feel relieved(539,6)some curious restraint; for, tipping all
sorts of knowing winks in all (30,9)directions(886,6)kicking off his
shoe(944,7)trike(844,7)a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe(416,6)
over the Grand Turk’s head;(522,9), by a dexterous sleight, pitching
his cap u(731,11)mizentop for a shelf, he goes down roll(217,7)so
far at least as he remains visible(903,6)the deck, revers(347,7) other
process(315,6)by bringing(607,8)rear(871,6)music. But ere ste(423,6)into
the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,
(319,6)independent, hila(551,6)little(710,6) enters King Ahab’s presence,
i(655,6)character of Abjectus, o(450,6)Slave.

It is no(991,6)(334,7)mo(961,6) strange things bred by the intense
artificialness of sea-usages,(973,6)while (151,7)open air of(412,9)
some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those

same(115,10)’s(539,6)(923,6)straightway(156,7)inoffensive,(393,6)o say
deprecatory and humble air(221,9)him,(764,7)sits a(454,6)head(351,7)
table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this
difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar,(674,6)of
Babylon; and t(46,24)not haughtily but courteously,
therein certainly must(122,11)some touch of mundane grandeur(957,6)he
who(654,8)rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
private(509,7)-table of invited guest(771,8)man’s unchallenged power
and dominion(62,6)dividual influence f(949,7)time;(81,12)royalty
of state transcends(391,11)’s, for(409,11) wa(1013,10)greatest.
Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Cæsar.
It is a witch(852,6) social czarship which there is no withstanding.
Now, if(878,6)is consideration you superadd the(950,6)ial supremacy of a
ship-master, then, by in(722,7), you will derive the cause(833,6)at
peculiarit(201,6)ea-life just mentioned.

O(542,8)ivory-inlaid table, Ahab(585,8)d like a mute, maned(88,7)on
o(666,6)white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still
deferential cubs. In(691,8) proper turn, each(312,6)er waited(455,6)
served. They were as little children before Ahab(982,6)yet, in Ahab(940,7) seemed(618,6)o lurk the smallest(534,8)arrogance. With one mind,
their intent eyes all fastened up(302,7)old(868,7)knife, as he carved
the chief dish(187,8)him. I do not suppose(943,6)(881,8)world they
would have profaned(987,7)oment with(221,6)lightest observation, even
upon so neutral a topic as(500,6)eather. No! And when reaching out his
knife and fork, between(852,10) slice of beef was locked(648,6)(413,6)by mo(701,6) Starbuck’s plate towards him, the mate received his
meat(185,6)ough(28,7)ing alms(531,6)cut it tenderly(552,6)a(587,7)
started if, perchance(110,6)(226,6)grazed against the(158,6)(93,7)hewed
it noiseless(99,8)swallowed it, no(414,6)out circumspection. For, like
the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor
profoundly dines(527,11)even Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals
were somehow solem(26,7), eaten in awful silenc(268,7)y(170,6)table old
Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himsel(546,6)dumb. What a relief
it was to choking Stubb,(665,6)a rat made a sudden racket i(919,6)hold
below. And poor(511,7) Flask, he(99,6)he youngest son, and(43,8)boy
of this weary family party. His w(410,8)shinbones of(913,6)aline beef;
his (971,11)bee(170,6)drumsticks. For(158,6) to(1010,8)esumed to help

neverthe(91,6)strange to say, Ahab(112,6)(594,9)him(465,6)had(457,6)
(186,14)(967,6)(979,6)(412,7)Ahab had(75,7)so much as noticed it.
Least of all, di(95,7)(386,8)(385,8)(698,9)to butter. Whether he
thought the owner(525,10)hip denied it(425,7), on account of its
clotting his clear, sunny complex(841,6)r w(119,9) d(510,7)hat, on so
long a voyage in such marketless waters,(198,7) was at a premium, and
therefor(812,6)not for(186,6)a subaltern; however (952,6),(868,8)alas!
was a(302,7)less man!

Another thing.(761,7)(915,8)last person down(658,6)e dinner(933,6)(512,6)i(964,6)(726,6)man up. Consider! For hereby(1017,6)’s(68,7) was badly
jammed in poi(394,6)time. Starbuck and Stubb both had(1011,6)tart of him;
and yet they als(964,7)the privilege of lounging(913,7) rear. If(98,6)
even, who is but a peg hig(302,6)an(351,8)happens t(106,7)(45,6)small
appetite(299,6)soon shows symptoms of conclud(622,8)repast, the(100,7)
must bestir(867,10)he will not get more(153,6)three mouthfuls that
day; for it is against holy usage for(351,7)to precede(896,7)to the
deck. T(655,9)(617,6) that(937,7)once admitt(460,7)rivate,(37,6)ever
since he had arisen(97,7) dignity of an officer, from(102,6)moment he
had never known what(145,9)o be otherwis(278,7)hungry,(296,6)or less.
For(59,6)he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal
in him. Peace(494,6)atisfaction, though(295,7),(660,6)for ever departed
from my stomach. I am(267,11); but, how I wish I could fish a bit of
old-fashioned beef(743,8)forecastle, as I used to when I(912,6)efore
the mast(498,7)’(995,7)ruits of promotion now; t(37,11)va(455,7)
glory:(29,13)ins(31,8) life! Besides, if it were so(600,6)any
mere sailor of the Pequod(579,6) grudge(724,9)(692,6)i(930,7)’s
official capacity, all(696,6)(87,7)had to do, in order to obtain ample
vengeance,(614,8)go aft at dinner-tim(1005,7)get a peep (798,8)
through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered(405,8)awful Ahab.

Now, Ahab and his(1019,8)ates formed(793,6)may be called(521,6)irst table
(540,7)(340,6)’s(156,6). After thei(675,8)ure, taking place in inverted

restor(659,6)some hurried(403,7)by the pallid steward. And then the
(260,6)harpooneers(593,6)bidden(159,7) feast, they being its residuary
legatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’ hall(670,8)high and
mighty(337,7)

In strange contrast(145,8)hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
invisible domineerings(792,8)captain’s(475,6)(682,7)he entire care-free
license and ease(424,6)almost frantic democracy(888,6)ose inferior

like lords;(540,6)fi(818,8)ir bellies like Indian ships all day loading
(133,6)pices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that
to fill out the vacancies(657,6)(782,8)revious repast, oft(780,6) pale
Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk(427,6)ingly

ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,

into(387,9)empty wooden trencher, while(540,11)knife in hand,
began laying(555,9)circle preliminary to scalp(292,7). He was
naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little (1021,6), this
bread-faced steward;(666,7)ogen(418,6) bankrupt baker and a hospital
nur(395,8)what(967,6)the standing spectacle(639,8)black terrific Ahab,
(359,6)e periodical tumultuous visitations(709,7)se three savages,(472,13)whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after
seeing the (620,7)eers furnish(604,9)ll things they demanded, he
would escape from their clutches into his(404,8)pantry adjoining, and
fearfully peep out at them throug(359,6)blinds of its door, till all was
over.

It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against(697,11)opposing
his filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise(27,7)m,(925,7)(98,9)n
the floor, for a bench (312,6)have brough(1017,6)hearse-plumed head(118,7)
low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, mak(481,8)low
cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in
a ship. But(213,6)(546,6)s, the great negro was wonde(478,7)abstemious,
no(410,6)ay dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused(600,9)so
broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this nobl(919,8)
fed strong and drank deep(967,7) abounding element of air; an(146,9)
his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublim(1014,7)(94,7)worlds. Not by
beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished(462,6)(803,8), he had a
mortal, barbaric smack(210,8)lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so
much so,(455,6)the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked(949,8)whether any
marks of(912,7)lurk(274,6)his own lean arms. And(723,6)he(877,8)ear

they(364,7)ostentatiously sharpe(123,8)knives;(980,6)grating(563,7)did
not at all tend to tranquillize poor(566,10). How(1009,7)he forget
that(537,8)Island days,(737,11)for one, must certainly have been
guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas!(723,10)!
hard fares(423,7)ite waiter who waits upon cannibal(962,7)a napkin
sh(221,8)carry o(752,6)arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his
great delight(697,6)three salt-sea warriors(817,7)rise and depart; to
his credulous, fable-mongering ears,(443,6)heir martial(829,7)jingling
(746,6)m at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.

But(220,8) these barbarians din(742,9) cabin, and nominally lived
there; still, being anything(950,6)edentary(819,10)habits, (744,6)ere
scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes(131,6)just before sleeping-time,
wh(797,6)y passed through it to(946,7)own peculiar quarters.

In this one matter, Ahab seemed no(148,7)ion to most American whale
captains, who, as a set, rather incline(141,7) opinion(962,6)by rights
the ship’s(379,6) belongs(196,7)m; and(1015,6)it is by courtesy alone that
anybody else is, at any(727,7)permitted there. So that, in real truth,
the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to
have(566,6) out(60,8)(225,6)than(504,6). For (457,10)did enter it, it
was some(611,6)(354,6)treet-door(44,6)s a house; turning inwards for a
moment, only to be turn(155,7)the next; and(454,7)permanent thing,
resid(90,6)(460,7)en air. Nor did(736,6)lose much hereby;(853,13)
was no companionship; socially(641,7)was inaccessible. T(951,6)(910,9)
includ(947,11)ensus of Christendom, he was(943,6) an alien to it. He

Missouri. And as(462,6)Spring and Summer had departed,(772,6)wild Logan
(604,7)woods, burying himself(373,8)hollow of a tree,(609,11)the
winter(737,6), suck(69,6)s own paws; so, in his incle(538,6)howling old
age(394,6)’s soul, shut up(460,10)ved trunk of his body,(858,6) fed
upo(552,6)sulle(124,6) of its gloom!


CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.

It was during the(874,7)leasant weather(329,7)in due rotation with the
other seamen my first mast-head came round.

In most American whalem(924,6)(53,10)s are manned almost
simultaneously(128,9) vessel’s leaving her port; even t(730,6)she may
have fifte(28,7)sand miles, and more, to sail ere reach(90,9)roper
cruising g(219,6) And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she
is drawing nigh home(348,6)anything empty in her—say, an(21,7)vial
even—then, her(325,16)kept(330,8)to(889,9); and not till her
skysail-poles(254,6)in amo(542,7)spires(946,8)port, does she altogether
relinquis(416,6)hope of capt(619,6)one(504,6) more.

Now, as the business of standing(537,11), ashore or afloat, is a
very ancient and interest(114,7), let us in some measure expatiate
here. I take it(761,7)the earliest(146,6)ers of(686,12)were the old
Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior(418,7)m.
For(698,8)their progenitors,(297,7)il(139,8)Babel, must doubtless, by
(61,6)tower, have intend(526,6)rear(531,6)oftie(952,13)(179,7)Asia,
or Africa either; yet ((247,8)final truck was put to it)(471,6)at great
ston(1000,6)(584,7)irs may be said to(166,6)gone by(531,6)oard, in the
dread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these(295,6)
(313,9)priority ove(263,6)(443,9)(976,6)(512,9)(467,9)(490,6)a

most usual point of perch is the head(572,8)t’ gallant-mast, where you
stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar(527,6)alemen)
called(104,15) cross-trees. Here, tossed about by(737,6)ea, the

Concerning all this,(200,7)much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
southern(864,6) ship are unprovided(682,6)those enviable little tents or

at last mount to my ultimate destination.

Let me m(105,6)clean breast of it here(951,6)frank(1007,7)(541,7)I kept
but sorry guard. With the problem(177,8)universe revolv(403,7)me, how
could I—being left completely(199,6)self at such a thought-engendering
altitude—how (83,7) but lightly hold my obligations to observe all

And l(368,6)in this place moving(347,6)onish you, ye ship-owners of

(247,6)men, disguste(512,6) the carking cares of earth(704,7)eeking
sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches
himself upon the mast-h(537,7)some luckless disappointed(275,7)ship,
and in moody phrase ejaculates:—


“Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand
(212,7)-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”



Very often do(332,7)ptains (714,8)ships take those(410,14)(657,6)

“interest” i(348,6)voyage; half-hint(72,6)at(814,6)are so hopelessly lost

There is no life in thee, now, except(661,6)rocking(39,7)mparted by a

CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.

(_Enter Ahab: Then, all._)

It was not a grea(444,8)after the affair(938,6)e pipe,(925,8)e morning
shortly(55,7)breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
cabin-gang(910,7)the deck. (758,6)most sea-captains us(1021,6)walk a(760,6)
hour, as country gentlemen,(208,11)same meal, take a few turns in
the garden.

Soon his steady, ivory stride(211,6)eard, as to and fro he paced his old
rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread(350,7)they were all over
dented, like geological stones(667,7)the peculiar mark of(377,6)alk. Did
you fixedly gaze, too(157,7)that ribbed and (116,6) brow; th(144,6)so,
you would see still strange(975,6)-prints—the(16,12)(143,8)one
unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.

But o(906,6)occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even (630,6)
nervous step(915,6)(698,7) left a(53,7) mark. And, so full(319,7)
(148,7) was(725,7)that at every uniform tur(326,7)he made, now(676,6)e
main-mast and(25,11) binnacle, you could al(761,7)e(531,8)ought
turn in him as he turned, and pace(30,14)paced; so completely
possessing him, indee(637,8)it all but seem(936,6) inward mould of
(249,6)outer movement.

“D’ye(635,6)him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s(213,8)pecks
the shell. ’Twill soon be out.”

The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up withi(964,6)cabin; anon, (618,9)e
deck(829,11)same intense bigotry of purpos(347,7)s aspect.

It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the
bulwarks(447,6)insert(407,6)s bone leg into the auger-hole(911,6), and
with one hand grasping a shroud, he ord(382,7)arbuck to send(705,6)body
aft.

“Sir!” sai(504,6)mate, astonished at an(80,6) seldom or never given on
ship-board except in some extraordinary case.

“S(139,13) aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads,(255,6)! come down!”

When the entire ship’s company were assembl(816,8)with curious(918,7)t
wholly unapprehensive faces,(70,6)eye(828,9)for he looked not unlike
the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly
glancing ove(608,6)(560,14)then da(563,10)eyes amo(734,6) crew,
started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul(303,6)nigh him
resumed his heavy turns upo(372,6)deck. With bent head and half-slouched
hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whisp(11,6)among
the men; till Stubb cautiously(48,8)(94,6)Flask, that Ahab must have
summoned them(850,6) fo(969,6)(1010,8)of witness(852,6)pedestrian feat.
But this di(511,6)last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—

“What do ye do(542,6)ye see a whale, men?”

“Sing out(625,6)im!” was the impulsive rejoinder(493,6)a score of clubbed
voices.

“Good!”(141,6)(638,7)with a wild approval in his tones; observi(609,6)
hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
thrown them.

“And w(283,10)next(265,10)Lower away(964,6)(819,6)him!”(59,12)tune is it ye pull to(335,10)A dead(357,6) or(917,6)ve boat!”

More and more strangely and fiercely gl(741,7)(301,6)ing, grew the
countenance(723,8)old man at every shout; while the mariners began to
gaze cur(732,7)at each other, as if marvelling how it(539,7)at they
themselves became so excited at such seemingly(764,8)less(439,9)s.

But, they were all eagerness again, as(588,7)now(1020,6)revolving(586,7)
pivot-hole(626,7)one hand reaching high up a shroud(490,6)tightly,
almost conv(761,6)ly grasping it, address(987,10)us:—

“All ye mast-headers have before(181,6)eard me give orders about a white
whale. Look ye! d’(950,7)this Spanish ou(507,7)gold?”—holding up a
broad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye
see it? Mr. Starbuck,(332,6)me yon top-maul.”

W(615,11)te was gett(973,7) hammer,(448,7)without speaking, was

to heighten its lustre(975,6)(120,8)using any words was mean(812,6)lowly
humming to himself, producing a sound so(960,11)muffled and
inarticulate(814,6)it seem(568,6) mechanical (106,8)(969,7)wheel(221,8)

Receiv(345,8)(388,8) from(424,12)e advanced towards(414,7)in-mast

“Huzza! huzza!” cri(560,7)seamen, as(383,6)swinging tarpaulins they
hail(612,7)act of nail(849,13)to(937,7)st.

“It’s(384,8)(287,8)I say,” resumed(952,7)as he threw down the
topmaul: “(68,13). Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for

All(330,6)(948,6)Tashtego, Daggoo(1008,6)Queequeg had l(561,6)on(704,6)even
more intens(8,6)rest and surprise than the rest(748,6)at(963,7)ntion of

struck(112,6)a(573,7)t which somewhat explained(505,6)he wonder. (204,8)
(569,6)I(845,6)heard of(281,10)—but it was not(306,11)that took off
thy leg?”

“Who told thee that?(679,12); then pausing, “Aye,(328,9)(643,7)my
hearties all(817,6);(138,8)(134,15)dismasted me;(163,15)

(235,6)aye!(340,8)that accurse(824,8)whal(76,7)raze(215,7)made a poor

look brave.”

excited old man: “A sharp ey(587,6)the(656,12); a(33,7)lance for

“God bless (831,9)eemed to half sob and(13,7)hout. (54,14)

“I am (28,9)his crooked jaw(765,6)(320,8)jaws of Death too, Captain
Ahab, if it fairly comes in(379,6)ay of the business we follow; but I
came here to hunt(725,6)s, not my commander’s vengeance. How many
barrels(658,6)thy(37,10) yield thee even if(313,6)gettest it(205,14)? it(730,6)not fetch(62,6)much in our Nantucket market.”

“(21,16)! Hoot! But come(699,7),(456,11)thou requirest a

let me tell thee, that m(410,12)will(353,7)a(792,7)premium _here!_”

“He smites(675,6)hest,” whispered Stubb, “(830,9)at for? methinks it
rings most vast, but hollow.”

“V(559,9)on a dumb brute!” cried(892,9), “that simply smote thee
from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged(347,6)(107,7)thing,
(852,7) (852,6)seems blasphemous.”

“Hark ye yet again—the (567,20)All visible objects(557,6)
are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—(970,7)living act, the

But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heap(13,6)I see in him outrageous

thee to anger-glow(240,6)look ye, Starbuck,(585,6)is said in he(399,6)at(629,7)unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small
indignity. I mean(371,6)to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder
Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living, brea(806,6)pictures painted by
(661,7). The Pagan leopards—the unrecking and unworshipping things,
that liv(881,7)seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!
The crew(624,7)t(15,7)! Ar(40,7)not one and all with Ahab, in this
matter of(1014,7)ale? See Stubb! he laughs! S(332,9) Chilian! he
snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one

Speak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence(225,8)_that_ voice(67,6).

his lungs.(475,9) now is mine;(505,7) oppose me now, without
rebellion.”

“God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured(577,9), lowly.

But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence(795,8)mate, Ahab
did(470,6)ear his foreboding invocation; nor ye(100,6)low(841,6)(310,6)the
hold(37,14)presaging vibrations(923,9)inds(951,6)e cordage; nor
(99,8)hollow flap(976,8)sails agains(236,6)masts, as for a moment
their hearts sank in. For(61,6)(908,9)’s downcast eyes lighted up
with(118,6)tubbornness of life;(144,6)ubterranean(271,7)died away; the
(231,6)blew on(53,7)ails filled out(75,7)hip heaved and rolled as
before. Ah, ye admoni(332,6)and warnings! why stay ye not(923,6)ye come?
But rather are ye predic(406,6)than(75,9), ye shadows! Yet not so
much(55,13)from(722,8), as verifi(562,6)(492,9)foregoing things
with(401,8)with little external to constrain us, the innermost
necessities in our being, these still drive us on.

“The measure!(771,6)(13,7)” cried Ahab.

Receiv(174,6)e brimming pewter, and turning to(682,6)arpooneers, he
ordered them to produce (662,6)weapons. Then rang(108,7)m (491,6) him
near(796,6)apstan,(297,6)(729,7)(113,6)(832,8)ir hands, while his three
mates stood at his side(76,12)lances(216,7)he rest(880,9)hip’s
company formed a circle rou(53,7)group; he(108,7)for an instant
searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild(916,6)met his,
as(403,6)loodsho(947,7)(613,7)prairie wolves meet the eye(648,7)ir
leader, ere he rushes on at(347,8)ead(343,7) trail(709,8)bison; but,
alas! only to fall in(525,8)idden snar(121,8) Indian.

“Drink and pass!” he(638,6), hand(630,8)heavy charged flagon(622,7)
nearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round(866,6)it,(432,6)! Short
draughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it goes
(516,6)excellently. It spiraliz(928,6)ye; forks out(363,7)
serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this
(18,7)comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
(998,9)life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!

“Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all(813,9)is(979,8); and

sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men,
you will yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies(23,6)not sooner.
(459,10). Why,(361,6)this pewter had run (446,9)again, wer’t not
thou St. Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!

“Advance, (397,8)! Cross(389,12) full(238,12)(683,9)! Let me
touch the axis.” So saying,(901,6)extended arm, he grasped the three
level, radiating(126,8)(822,6)ir crossed centre; while so doing,
suddenly and nervously twitch(107,6)m; meanwhile, glancing intently from
Starbuck to Stubb; from(12,6) to Flask(1006,6)eemed as though, by(592,6)nameless, interior volition, he would fain(821,6)shocked into th(936,6)

magnetic life. T(365,8)(889,6) quailed(714,8)his strong, sustained,
and mystic aspect.(267,7)and(268,6) looked sideways(304,6)him; the honest
eye of (351,9)f(583,6)wnright.

“In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did y(213,8)but
once take the full-forced(354,6), then mine own electric thing, _that_
had perhaps expired(516,6)ou(919,6)Perch(826,6)too, it(466,7)have dropped

Silently obeying the(99,6), t(862,9)(312,11) now stoo(942,6) the
detached iron part of their(371,8)s, som(942,8)feet long, held, barbs

“Stab me not(111,8)at keen steel! Cant them; c(11,8) over! know ye

slowly going(894,7)ne officer to(380,6)ther, he brimmed th(438,9)

“Now,(868,7)to(877,6), ye stand. Commen(100,6)murderous chalices! Bestow

Starbuck! bu(399,6)deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon

lifted; and to crie(953,6)maledictions agains(708,6)white(188,6), the
spiri(80,7) simultaneously quaffed down(942,6)a hiss. (398,8) paled,
and turned,(321,6)hivered. Once more(25,6)finally, the replenished

CHAPTER 37. Sunset.

_The(35,6); by(1017,6)tern windows;(88,6)sitting alon(244,7)gazing out_.

I leave a(396,7)(315,7)bid wake; pale(914,7), paler cheeks, where’er I
sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them;
but first I pass.

Yonder, by ever-brimming(634,7)’s ri(349,6) warm waves blush like wine.
The gold brow plumbs the blue(185,6)diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes
down; my soul mounts up! she wearies(667,6)her endless hill. Is, then,
the crown too heavy(982,6)I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it
bright(779,6)many a gem; I(860,6)earer, see not its far flashings; but
darkly feel(133,12) that,(151,6)dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that
I know—not gold(32,7)split, too—(226,7)feel; the jagged edge galls me
so, my brain seems to beat agains(912,6)solid metal; aye, steel skull,
mine(101,6)sort(349,6)needs no helmet in the most(111,6)-battering fight!

Dry heat upon(152,6)ow? Oh! time wa(775,6)n a(591,6)sunrise nobly spurred
me, so(33,8)set soothed. No more. This lovely light, it(10,6)s not
me; all(36,6)iness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted
with the high perception, I lack the low,(56,6)ing power; damned, most
subtly and(320,6)malignantly!(42,7)(352,9)idst of Paradise! Good
night—good night! (_waving his hand, he moves(904,6)the window_.)

’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, a(581,6)least;
but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
revolve. Or, if you will, like so(931,7)nt-hills of powder, they all
stand before me; and(975,6)ir match. Oh, hard!(943,6)to fire others, the
match itself mus(765,8)be wasting! What I’ve dared,(12,6)willed; and
w(34,9)(22,6), I’ll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m
demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild(28,9)that’s only calm to
comprehend(214,7)! The prophecy wa(56,6) I should be dismembered;
and—Aye! I lost this leg. I now(75,7)sy(71,8)will(66,10) my
(79,10)r. Now, then, be t(140,9)t(529,8) fulfiller one. That’s
more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at(50,7)
cricket-players, ye pugilist(14,6)deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I
will(829,6)ay as schoolboys do to bullies—Take some one of your own
size; don’t pommel _me!_ No, ye’ve knocked me down(816,6)I am up again(896,6)_ye_ have run(246,6)idden. Come forth from behind(133,6)cotton bags!
I(64,6)no long gun to reach ye(73,6), Ahab’s compliments to ye; come
and see if ye can swerve me. S(11,8)?(29,7)not(32,10), else ye
(51,7)yourselves! man has ye ther(77,14)The path to my fixed
purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.
Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under
torrents’ beds, unerringly I rush! Naught’s an obstacle, n(22,10)
angle to the(198,6)way!


CHAPTER 38. Dusk.

_By the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning(570,6)st it_.

M(258,10)(864,10)matched; she’s overmanned;(788,6)y a madman!
Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But
he drilled deep(755,11)blasted all my reason out of me! I think I
see his impious end; but feel(151,6)I must help him to it. Will I, nill
I,(364,6)neffable thing has ti(914,6)to him; tows me(611,6)a cable (847,6)
no knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who(353,7) him, he cries;—aye, he
would be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it(84,6)all below!
Oh! I plainly see my mis(442,7)office,—to obey, rebelling(500,6)worse
yet, to hat(243,7)touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid wo(212,8)shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is(1005,6) hope. Time and tide flow
wide. The hated whale(420,6)he (623,6)watery world to swim in, (38,6)
small gold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God
may wedge aside. I (440,6)up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole
clock’s run down; my(64,6) the all-controlling weight,(623,7) no key to
lift(1000,6).

[_A burst of revelry from the forecastle_.]

Oh, God! to sail(728,6)(942,7)heathen crew(996,6)have (325,6)(521,8)
human mothers in them! Whelpe(523,6)where by the sharkish sea(464,6)white

Foremost through(185,6)parkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled,
ban(115,7)bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, (294,6)he broods
with(860,7)sternward cabin, builded(1014,6)the dea(767,7) of the wake,
and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings(865,6)long howl thrills
me(267,8)! Peace! ye(606,6)lers, and se(696,6)watch! Oh, life! ’tis in
an hour(784,6)this,(624,7)oul beat down and he(962,6)knowledge,—as wild,
untutored things are forced to feed—(125,15)no(706,7)I do feel
the latent horror(700,7)e! but(55,8)t me(614,7)(38,6)’s out of me!
and(819,6)the soft feeling(390,8)(798,6)in me, yet will I try to fight
ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me, bin(9,6)O ye
blessed influences!


CHAPTER 39. First Night-Watch.

Fore-Top.

(_Stubb solu(463,7)mending a brace_.)

Ha! ha! h(8,8)em! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking(681,6)it ever
since(564,6)(346,6)a, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a
laugh(49,7)wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what
will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing(37,8) is, i(44,6)l
predestinated. I heard not all his talk(745,6)Starbuck; but to my poor
eye(29,9) then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure
the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the
gift, might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon
his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, _wise_(14,6)—(423,7)my title—well,
(42,7)what of it(61,7)? Here’s a carcase. I know(377,9)that may be
coming, but be it(82,6)i(910,6), I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
leer(394,7)lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,
skirra! W(241,9)juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes
out?—Giv(929,6)party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as
a frigate’s pennant(1022,6)so am I—f(191,13) (191,8)Oh—


We’ll drink to-night(746,6)hearts as light, To love, as(124,6)nd fleeting
As bubbles(440,6)swim, on the beaker’s brim, And break(32,8)lips while
m(80,6).



A brave stave that—who calls? Mr.(910,9)? Aye, aye, sir—(_Aside_)
he(660,6)superior, he has(983,6)oo, if I’m not mistaken.—(79,13),
just through(286,6)this job—(666,6).

CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.

I, Ishmael, was one(741,6)at crew; my shouts had gone up with(855,6)est;
my oath had been welded(39,9)irs; and stronger I(86,6)ed(769,6)more
did I hammer and clinch (94,7), becaus(162,7)e dread in my soul. A
wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud
seemed mine. With greedy ears I learne(688,6)history(313,9)murderous
monster against whom I an(774,9) other(349,6)taken our oaths of
violence and revenge.

For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
secluded(969,7)Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
frequented by the Sperm(72,7)fishermen. But not(892,6)f them knew of
his existence;(964,6)a few(42,8), comparatively, had knowingly seen
him; while the number who as yet had actually an(65,12)given
battle to him(774,6)(903,6)indeed. For, owing to the larg(108,9)of
whale-cruisers;(669,6)isorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire
watery circumference, man(603,7)em adventurously pushing(866,6) quest
along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth
or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any

direct and in(13,6), long obstruc(761,6)e spread through the(289,6)
world-wide whaling-fleet(732,7) special individualizing tidings
concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels
reported to have(405,10)ed, at such or(8,6)a time, or on(27,8)
(27,7)meridian, a(965,13)of uncommon magnitude and malignity,
which whale, after doing great mischief(861,6)s assailants, had
completely escap(383,6)m; to some minds i(288,6)not an unfair
presumption, I say(300,7)(430,6)ale in(788,6)ion must(299,6)been no(547,6)
than(396,12)Yet as of late the(278,13)fishery had(73,6)marked
by various and not unfrequent in(644,7) of(283,7)ferocity, cunning, and
malice in the monster attacked; therefore(277,7)(244,9)ose who by
accident ignorantly gave battle to(637,10);(554,6)hunters, perhaps,
for(131,7)st part, were content to ascrib(292,6)peculiar terror he bred,
more, a(453,6)ere, to(50,7)rils(825,8)(356,20)at large,(421,6)(56,7)(859,10) cause. In(805,6)way, mostly, the disastrous
(800,9) between Ahab an(1009,6)(560,6)had hitherto(551,6)popularly
regarded.

And as (290,6)(376,7), previously hearing(220,8)White(854,6), by chance
caught sight of him;(505,8)beginn(68,11)thing the(635,6)every one

other(822,7)of(840,6)species. But at length,(561,6)calamities did ensue
(694,6)se assaults—not restricted to sprained wrist(814,6)ankles, broken
limbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal(587,8)last degree of
fatality;(791,7)repeated(528,11) repulses, all accumulating and
pil(368,7)i(723,8)s upon(826,12)(885,6)things had gone far to shake
the fortitude of many brave(884,10)to whom the story(569,13)
(789,6)(502,7)ntually come.

Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still(993,7)re
horrify(619,6)rue historie(929,8)se deadly (842,9)s. For not only do
fabulous(139,8)naturally grow out(1008,8)very body(175,9)urprising
terrible(240,6)s,—as(284,6)mitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in
maritime life, far more than(872,6)a(143,6)erra firma,(329,12)

And (192,8)ea surpasse(210,6)land(1011,6)is matter, s(725,6)(909,6)fishery

No(799,7), then(365,7)ever gathering volume(718,8)e mere transit over
the wid(438,9)y spac(201,8)outblown(869,8)(883,7)White Whale did in

eventually invested Moby Dick(828,6)new terrors unborrowed(1005,6)anything
that visibly appears. So(718,6)in many cases(520,8)panic did he finally
strike(773,7)few who by those(337,7), at least, ha(711,6)d(358,13)
Whale, few(689,6)ose hunters were wi(645,6)to encounter the perils of his
jaw.

But there(60,6)still other and more vital practical(695,13)t work.
Not even at(108,6)resent day has(573,6)riginal prestige(882,8)Sperm(217,8)as fearfully distinguish(408,9)(161,9)specie(645,8)

(398,6)this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
en(34,7) off(887,6)battle to the Greenland or Right(148,6), would
perhaps—either(941,6)professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
timidity, decline a contest(902,9)(375,6)(950,6); at any rate,(530,6)
are plenty of(311,9), especiall(287,10)os(344,6)ing na(928,6)not
sailing und(645,7)American flag, who have never hostilely(699,10)ed

seated on their hatches, these men will hearken(356,6)a childish

anywhere(987,6)feelingly comprehended, than on board(935,6)ose prows
which stem him.

And as i(974,6)now tested reali(575,6)his might had in former legendary
times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
naturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declari(965,6)(755,12) not only to
b(801,7)ster(704,6) to every other creature(537,8)sea(648,6)also to be
so incredibly ferocious as continually(45,6) athirst for human blood.
Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were(645,7)or almost
similar impressions effaced. For in his N(317,6) History, the Baron
himself affirms that at sight(871,8)(916,13)all fish (sharks
included) are “struck(794,6)the most l(885,6)terrors,” and “often(898,7)
precipitancy(992,7)ir flight dash themselves against the rocks with
such violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however(839,6)eneral
experiences(520,8)fishery may amend such reports as(414,6); yet in
(191,7)ull terribleness,(499,6)to the(522,6)(544,6)y item of(723,9), the
superstitious belief(668,7)m is, in(807,6)vicissitudes(320,9)
vocation, revived(728,8)mind(40,8) hunters.

So(515,6)overawed by(357,6)umors and portents concerning him, not a few
(568,7)(308,6)men recalled, in reference to Moby Dick(662,6)earlier days(71,8)(973,12)(391,7), when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
practised Right whalem(390,6)embark(1005,8)peril(318,7)is new and daring
warfare;(506,6)men protesting(825,7)lthough other leviathans might be
hopefully pursued, yet to chase(354,7)int lance at(617,6)an apparition
(623,6)(282,13)was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be
inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On(279,6)head, there are
some remarkable documents(587,6)may be consulted.

Nevertheless,(703,6)(79,6)were, who(807,6)(892,8)ace(723,7)se things
were ready to give(322,7)(597,12); and a still greater number who,
chancing on(261,6)hear of him distantly and vaguely, without(928,6)pecific deta(573,7)any certain calamity, and(58,9)(982,13)
accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offered.

On(304,8) wild suggestions(894,6)red to, as at last coming(519,7)linked
with the White(899,7)(812,7)mind(811,7)e(208,14)ly inclined, was
the unearthly conceit(818,6)(1023,9) was ubiquitous;(849,6)he had
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at on(844,6)the same
instant of time.

Nor, credulous as(985,7)inds must have been, was(766,6)(191,7)
altogether(470,10)ome faint show of(489,14) probability. For (285,7)secret(334,9)currents(768,8)seas(140,6)never yet(266,6)divulged,
even to(410,6)ost erudite research; s(30,6)hidden way(446,9)Sperm

the mystic modes whereby, after soun(69,6)o a(213,7)depth, he
transports himself with(548,6)vast swiftness(377,13)widely distant
points.

It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and
as(60,6)(73,8)placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,
tha(689,7)whale(608,7)been captured far north(1012,8)Pacific, in whose
bodi(61,13)fou(886,7)barbs of harpoons dart(948,6)the Greenland
seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in(864,6)(804,6)se (977,6)ces it has
(787,6)eclared(53,6)the interval(1018,8) betwee(859,6)two assaults could
no(1017,7)exceeded very many days. Hence, by infer(14,6)(133,6) been
believed by(356,11)men(204,7)the Nor’ West Passage, so long a
problem to man, was(1020,7)a (28,11)th(447,7). So(295,6)here,(432,7)

Land by an underground p(460,6));(677,7)fabulous narrations are almost
fully equall(559,6)the realiti(376,10)(575,8).

Forced into familiarity, then, with such(466,11)as(818,6); and
knowing(853,6)after repeated, intrepid(788,9)(542,6)White Whale had
escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise(431,7)(781,12)

But even stripped(888,7)se(446,6)natural surmising(595,6)re was enough in
the earthly make and incontestable charac(600,7)the monster to strike
the imagination(783,6)unwonted power. For, it was not so(693,6)his
uncommon bulk(692,8)(724,6)distinguished him from other sperm(936,6)s,
but, as(227,6)lsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled
forehead, and a high, pyramidical (49,6)hump. These were his prominent
features; the tokens whereby,(438,6)(875,6) limitless, uncharted sea(726,6)revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.

The rest of his body was so streake(238,7)spott(13,8)marbled(456,6)the
same shrouded hue, that,(201,8)end, he had gain(181,7)(444,6)ctive
appell(544,6)(585,7)White Whale; a name,(934,7), literally justified by
his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spang(275,9)golden
gleamings.

Nor was it(968,7)(765,7)magnitude, nor his remarkable(330,6)nor yet his

terror, as(839,6)unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
specific accounts(478,9)over an(9,8)gain evinced in his assaults.
More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than
perhaps aught else. For(503,8)wimming befo(905,7)exulting pursuers,
with every apparent symptom of alarm(704,9)several times been known
to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their
boats to splinters, or dri(35,6)m back in constern(822,6)to(65,6) ship.

Already(177,9)fatalities had attend(906,7)chase. But though similar
disas(133,6)however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in
the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seem(703,7)(1024,11)’s
infernal afore(166,6)t of ferocity(778,7)(456,6)dismembering or death
that he caused, was not wholly regarded as h(1022,6)been inflicted by an
un(811,12)agent.

Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of
his(746,6)desperate hunters(354,6)impelled(739,7)ami(1005,6)chips of chewed(583,6), an(333,6)sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the
white curd(51,6)he w(399,6) direful wrath in(638,6) serene, exa(190,6)ing
sunlight(418,7)smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.

His three (789,6)stove a(866,6)him(223,6)oars and men both whirling in the
eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
dashed at(265,10), as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly
seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life(402,10)ale. That(202,8) was Ahab. A(493,6)n it was(368,8)uddenly sweeping
his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath(351,6)Moby Dick had reaped away
Ahab’s leg(260,6) mower a(205,7)of grass(386,7) field. No turbaned Turk,
no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him(317,6)more seeming
malice. Small reaso(277,6)there to doubt(923,9)hat ever since that
almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cheri(512,6) wild vindictiveness
agains(539,14)ll(987,6)ore fell for(771,6)in(542,6)rantic morbidness
he at last came to identify(568,6)him, not only all(685,6)odily woes, but
(25,8)intellectual and spiritual(932,11)ons. The White Whale swam
befor(377,6)(337,6) monomaniac incarnation of(240,7)ose malicious
agencies which some deep men feel eat(938,10)m, ti(311,6)y are left
living on(258,7)alf a heart and(17,8)lung(795,7)intangibl(140,6)gnity
(131,6)has been(1001,6)the beginning; to whose dominion eve(706,6)modern
Christians ascribe one-half(932,7) worlds;(243,7)the ancient Ophites of
the east reverenced(812,7)ir statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and
worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the
abhorred whit(700,9)he pitted himself(719,6)mutilated, (753,8)it. All
that most maddens and torments;(782,7)at stirs up the lees(312,6)ings;
all truth(1000,7)alice in it(67,11)crack(655,6)sinew(108,6)cakes the
brain(115,8)e subtle demonisms of life(162,6)hough(94,7)evil, to crazy
Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby
Dick. He piled upo(596,6)whale’s(379,7)hum(277,6)sum(848,10)e general
rag(179,6)hate felt by his whole race(726,6)Adam down;(227,7)en, as if
his chest had(777,6)a mortar, he burst his hot(868,6)’s shell(184,6)it.

It is not probable(476,6)this monomania in him took(632,6)nstant rise at
the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the
monster, knife in hand, he(228,6)ut given loose to a sudden, passionate,
corporal animosity(319,6)when he received(632,6)trok(246,8)ore him, he

Yet,(120,6)by(341,6)collision forced to turn towards home(658,6)for long
months of day(912,6)weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in
one hammock, rounding in mid winter(984,6)dreary, howling Patagonian
Cape; then it was,(968,6)his torn body and gashed soul bled into one
another(722,6)so interfusing,(901,6)him mad. That(105,7) only(769,7)on
the homeward voyage, af(196,6)e encounter(160,7)the final(724,10)
seized(495,6)seems all but certain(899,6)the fact that, at(177,6)vals
during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a
leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked(902,6)s Egyptian(1023,6)(555,6)was
moreover intensified by his delirium(432,11)mates were(650,10)
lac(384,6)fast, even there, as he sailed,(222,8)(147,7)(600,7). In a
strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And(815,6)
runn(672,6)to more sufferable latitudes,(963,6)hip, with mild stun’sails
spread, floated across the tranquil tropics,(418,7)o all appearances,
the old man’(332,10) seemed left behind him(137,6)the Cape Horn

and issued his calm orders once again(928,6)(553,10)thanked God the
direful madness was now gone(165,13)Ahab,(553,9)idden self,
raved on. Human(75,9)is oftentimes a c(524,7)and most feline thing.
When you think it fled, it may have but becom(504,6)sfigured(607,6)some
still subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly
contracted; like the unabated Hudso(439,8)that noble Northman flows
narrowly(95,6)unfathomably throug(606,6)Highland gorge. But, as(915,7)(70,7)-flowing monomania, not one jot of(229,8)broad(462,9)had been
(733,11); so i(186,7)(47,13)(84,17)his great natural
intellect had perished. That before living agent, now becam(326,6)(29,6)
instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his specia(450,8)
storm(763,7)general sanity(928,6)carried it(944,6)turned all its
concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so(915,7)ar(998,7)aving lost
his strength(803,8)t(49,7)one end, did now possess a thousand fold
more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear(174,6)any one
reasonable object.

This is much; yet(775,8)larger, darker,(761,6)r part remains unhinted.
But vain to popularize profundities(368,6)all truth is profound. Winding
far down(324,6)within the very heart of t(490,6)iked Hotel de Cluny where
we here(537,6)—however grand and wonderful(634,6)quit it;—and take your
way, ye(953,6)r, sadder souls(450,7)ose vast Roman halls of Thermes;
where far beneat(975,6)fantastic towers of man’s upper earth(721,6)root
of(189,6)eur(743,6)whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique
buried(138,9)(23,6)(414,11)throned on torsoes! So with a broken
(37,6), the(1015,7)gods mock(772,6)captive king; so like a Caryatid, he
patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of
ages(573,6) ye(569,6)there, ye proud(439,16)! question that
proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget y(98,6)young
exiled royalties; and(705,6)your grim sire only will the old
State-secret come.

Now, i(263,6)heart, Ahab(999,6)ome glimpse(777,8), namely: all my means
are sane, my motive and my(1022,7) mad. Yet without power to kill, or
change, or shu(907,6)fact; he likewise knew(507,6)to mankind(305,8)long
dissemble; in(197,6)sort, did still. But(68,7)hing of his (58,8)ing
was(323,6)su(193,6)to his perceptibility, no(27,9)will determinate.
Nevertheless, so well did he succeed i(542,6)(126,12),(732,6)when
with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him
otherwise than but naturally grieved(918,8)(346,6)the quick,(914,6)the
terrible casualty which had overtaken him.

The report(350,8)undeniable delirium at sea was(481,10)popularly
ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, a(742,7)added moodiness(159,6)
always afterwards,(225,8)very day of sailing(399,6)e Pequod on the
present voyage, sat brooding o(831,6)brow. Nor is it so(96,6)unlikely,
that far(944,6)distrusting his fitness for another whaling(120,9)on
account of such dark symptoms, the calculating peopl(959,7)at prudent
isle were inclin(357,6)harbor(68,6)onceit(650,7)for thos(307,7)reasons
he was(383,9)better qualified and set on edge,(220,6) pursu(290,6)full
of rage and wildness as(84,6)loody h(243,7)whales. Gnawed within and
scorch(20,7)out(696,10) infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable
idea;(347,6)an one, could he be found, would seem(585,10)man to dart
his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.
Or, if(530,7)(375,8)(985,9)to be corporeally incapacitated(437,7)at,
yet(210,12)(190,12)superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
(967,8)rlings(838,8)attack. But be(909,7)is as it may, certain it is(777,7)(415,9)mad secret of (100,6)abated(535,6)bolted up and keyed in
him, Ahab had purposely sailed up(956,6) (956,14)(534,10)one
only and all-engrossing objec(143,6)u(559,6)the White Whale. Had any(71,6)(183,6)old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed(716,7)t was lurking
in him then, how soon(619,7)their aghast and righteous souls have
wrenched the ship from(718,7) fiendish man! They were bent on
profitable cruises,(322,7)ofi(624,10)unted down in dollars(105,6)the
mint. He was int(93,6) an audacious, immitigable, and(648,6)natural
revenge.

Here,(274,7)was(601,6)grey-head(980,6)godly old man, chasing(1023,6)curses
a Job’s whale roun(291,6)world, a(909,6)head of a crew, too, chiefly made
up of mongrel renegades(195,6)castaway(15,9)nnibals—morally enfeebled
also, by the in(887,8)ce of mere unaided virtue or(497,6)-mindedness in
Starbuck(424,6)invulnerable jollity of indifference(572,6)eckless(71,10)ubb(392,6)the pervading mediocrity in Flask. S(590,6)(292,6)so
officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality
to help(772,6)o his monomaniac (532,8) How i(825,6)th(442,6)y so

White Whale as much(961,7)insuff(419,7)foe as his; how all(737,6)came to
be—w(227,7) (84,12)was(217,7)m, or how(233,7)ir unconscious
understandings, (632,6)in(387,6)dim, unsuspected way, he might have

explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean
min(44,6)t works in us all, how can one tell whither lead(432,6)shaft by
the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the
irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand
still? For one, I gave myself up(697,8)abandonment(365,8)tim(967,6)the
place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see
naught in(847,6)brute bu(630,6)deadliest ill.


CHAPTER 42(422,6)Whiteness(523,8)Whale.

W(697,8)whit(119,7)(697,8)Ahab, has been hinted; what,(873,9), he
(746,7)me, as yet remains unsaid.

Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
(273,6)not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul(838,6)alarm, ther(176,6)another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,
which(265,9) by its intensity completely overpowered (888,6)e rest;
and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffab(408,7)it,(865,6)I almost
despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It(481,6)(501,8)(535,7)
(631,9)(961,6)above(173,7)ings appalled me. But(978,9)I hope to

*With reference(702,8)Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
would fain go still deeper into(827,6)matter,(785,6)(361,6)(238,7)
(708,11)separately regarded(881,8)(639,8)(771,6)intolerable

it might be said, only rises(847,6)the circumstance(206,7)the
irresponsible feroci(148,13)e creature stands invested in the
fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together
two(694,6)opposite emotions in our minds,(492,15) fr(353,8)us
with so unnatural a contrast. But(765,6)assuming all(488,6)to be true;
yet, were i(732,6)for(1009,10)(836,6)you (577,6)not have(547,7)ntensified

same quality(455,7)(830,7)quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly
hit by the French(75,8)name they bestow upo(194,6) fish. The Romish

Bethink thee(908,8)albatross(249,8) come those clouds of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread, in which(696,6)(664,6)phantom sails(267,7)

unflattering laureate, Nature.*

*I remembe(876,6)(90,6)(241,9) I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
gale(219,6)aters hard(639,8)e Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
below, I ascended(521,8)overclouded deck; (491,7)re, dashe(109,10)
main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted(623,6)ness, and
with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its
vas(22,6)angel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous
flu(444,7)s(243,7)robbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered
crie(120,6)some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Throug(201,6)inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peep(442,6)secrets(750,8)ook
hold of God. As Abraham before(875,6)ngels, I bowed myself; the(813,6)

(679,6), I had lost the miserable warping memories of tradition(397,6)of
towns. Long I gazed at(986,6)prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only
hint, the(664,6)s(980,6)darte(501,6)ugh me then. But at last I awoke; and
turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!
never had heard(208,6)name(425,7); is it conceivable(244,6)this glorious(425,7)is(647,6)ly unknown to men ashore! never! But(777,6)time after, I
learne(133,7)goney(508,7)me seaman’s(157,6)for albatross. So(393,6)by no

days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountain(347,6)the Alleghanies. At
their flaming head he westward trooped it like(601,6)chosen star which
every evening leads(824,8)hosts of light. The flash(285,6)scade of his
mane, the curving comet(31,7) tail, invested him(979,6)housings more
resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnish(85,6). A
most imperial(721,6)rchangelical apparition(663,6)at unfallen, w(726,6)

Nor can it be questioned from what stan(919,6)legendary record(707,6)is
noble horse,(1003,6)it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly(740,8)so
clot(840,7)(925,6)divine(287,6)and(812,6)this(26,11) ha(25,7)in it
which, though commanding worship,(476,8)same time enforced a certain
nameless terror.

But there are other instanc(842,6)re(783,6)(226,10)loses all that
accessory and strange glory(1000,7)invests it(794,8)White (628,6)and
Albatross.

What is it(256,9)the Albino man so peculiarly repel(897,6)often shocks
the eye,(977,6)at sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is
that(480,11)(211,14)him, a thing express(83,6)the name he

deformity—and ye(560,7)mere(854,8)of all-perva(538,6)(660,9)makes him
more(420,8)ly hideous tha(409,6)ugliest abortion. Why should(675,6)be
so?

Nor, in quit(569,8)(992,6)s, does Nature in her least palpable but not
the l(164,6)licious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces(930,6)crowning attribute(957,6)e terrible. From its snowy(306,7), the
gauntleted ghost(61,8)Southern Seas has been denominated(714,10)
Squall. (277,8)some historic(848,10), has the art of human(251,6)e

cannot(894,6)be doubted, that the one visible quality(304,8)(877,9)

there; as if indeed(135,6)(42,7)w(993,6) much like the badge of

from(117,13)(831,7)dead, we borrow(616,6)xpressive hu(873,8)

Therefore, in his(434,7)moods,(908,7)ize whatever grand or gracious
thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny(727,6)in its profoundest
idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition(871,9)oul.

But though without dissent(886,6)point be fixed, how is(659,8)man to
account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by
the cit(783,6)of som(677,7)ose instances wherein(161,6)(332,6)of

L(827,6)try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to(20,9),

entirely conscious(127,7)m at(602,9), and therefore may not be able
to recall(58,6)now.

Why(904,8)man of untutored (985,6)ty, who happens (212,6)but loosely

(788,7)unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to(240,14)y, in
reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe(368,7)“the tall pale man”
(379,7)Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides

Nor is it, altogether(882,6)remembrance of her cathedral-toppling

is not these things alone which make (315,8) Lima(433,6)strangest,
saddest city thou can’st see. For Lima has take(923,7)hite veil; and
there is a higher horror in(642,6)white(444,8)her woe. Old as Pizarro,
(43,15)keeps her ruins for ever new; admit(256,9) cheerful

I know that, to(156,6)ommon apprehension,(922,8)enomenon of(294,10)(473,8)confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating th(992,6)or of

au(835,7)(86,7)in those appearances w(18,6)wfulness to another mind
almost solely consists(540,9)one(264,11), especially when
exhibited under any form at(918,6)pproaching to mu(618,8)r
universality. What I mean by(822,8)wo statements may perhaps be
respectively elucidated(63,7) following examples.

First: The mariner, when drawing nigh(536,7)asts of foreign lands, if
by night he hear(666,6)oar of breakers, st(695,6)o vigilance, and feels
just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but(367,6)
precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to
view his ship sail(689,6)rough a mid(240,6)sea of milky(786,10)—as if
from encircling headlands shoal(1012,8)bed(845,6) bears were swimming
round him, then he(302,6) a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded
phantom of the(955,8)d waters is ho(877,6) to him as a real ghost; in
vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm
they both go down; he never rests till blue(158,6) is(843,7)him again.
Yet where(1021,7)(700,8) who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much
the fe(677,6)striking hidden rocks, a(95,6)(38,8)that hideous
(495,9)(23,6)so stirred me?”

Second: To the native Indian of Peru,(859,7)ntinual sight(423,7)
snow-howdahed Andes conveys nau(42,7)dread, except, perhaps, (428,6)
mere fancying(513,8)eternal frosted desola(206,7)reigning at such vast
altitudes(946,6)(210,7)ural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to
lose oneself in(98,6)inhuman sol(101,6). Much(709,6)ame i(72,6)ith the
backwoodsm(331,6)the West,(513,7)th compar(372,6)indifference views an

the scenery(932,8)Antarctic seas;(751,7)at times, by some infernal
trick of legerdemain(517,7) powers of(498,6) and air, he, shivering and
half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows spea(815,6)ope and solace to his
misery,(365,7)what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with
its lean ice monuments(112,6)plintered crosses.

But thou sayest, methink(931,7)white-lead chapter abou(25,7)(686,6)s
but a(443,6) flag hung out from a craven soul;(111,7)urrenderest to a

Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in(475,6)peaceful valley of
Vermont, far removed(151,7)ll beasts of prey—why(825,7)that(347,6)the
sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him,(711,6)at
he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why
will he start, snort, an(902,7)bursting eyes paw the ground in
phrensies of affright? There is no rememb(916,6)i(605,6)of any gorings of
wild creatures(40,6)s green northern home(255,9)(971,6)trange

experience of former perils; for(841,6)knows he,(584,6)New England(583,6)
of the black bisons of distant Oregon?

No: but here(823,6)beholdes(466,7)in a dumb brute, the instinct (103,6)
knowledge(17,7) demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from
(150,6), still when(331,11)that savage musk(138,6)rending,(456,7)
bison herds are as present as to(158,7)ser(374,6)ld foal(201,8)prairies, which(934,6)in(309,6)they may be trampling into dust.

Thus, then(296,6)muffled roll(614,7) a milky sea;(420,7)eak rust(36,8)

windrowed snows of (219,8); all these, to Ishmael,(303,8)the shaking(582,6)at buffalo robe(325,8)(871,6)ene(627,6)!

(478,7)neither(676,7)where lie the nameless th(272,8)(361,8)e mystic
sign gives forth such hints; yet(812,6)me, as(824,9)(759,6) somewhere

But not yet have we solved(848,7)cantation(851,6)is whiteness, and
learned why it appeal(256,7)such power(738,8)soul; and more strange
and far(21,6)portentous—why(334,6)e(158,6)seen, it is at onc(447,6)most

Is it(710,7)y its indefin(350,7) it shadow(623,8)the heartless voids
and immensitie(871,8) universe, and thus stabs us from behind(678,9)
thought of annihilation, when beholding the(513,6) depth(113,9)milky

“HIST! Did you hea(678,7)noise, Cabaco?”

It(116,9)middle-watch: a fair moonlight;(152,6)eamen were standing in
a cordon, exte(23,6)from(748,8)the fresh-water butts in(394,6)aist, to

hallowed precincts(199,8)quarter-deck(126,7)were careful not to speak
or rustle(642,7)feet. From hand to hand(812,6)(186,8)went(284,7)

CHAPTER 44. The Chart.

Ha(994,6)followed Captain Ahab (288,7)to his cabin(296,6) the squall that
took place o(336,6)night succeedi(889,8)wild ratification of his
purpose with(110,6)rew(631,6)would(836,6)seen him go to a locker(260,8)transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll(821,6)llowish sea
charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating
himself(59,8)it(201,26)intently study the various
lines and shadings which(713,7)met his eye(655,6)with slow but steady
pencil trace additional courses over spaces(968,6)(239,7)were blank. At
intervals, he(402,7)refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein
were set(603,6)the season(232,6)places in(233,6), on(270,8) former
voyag(110,6)(26,8)ships, sperm whales had(950,6)captured or seen.

While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chain(306,7)his
head, continually rocke(393,7)the mo(739,8)the ship(667,6)for ever
threw shifting gleam(499,10)ows of (520,6)up(638,7)(707,9)brow, till
it almost seemed(877,7)hile he (656,8)was mark(790,8)(610,9)
(527,9)(957,6)(807,9)(785,9)ome invisible (598,7)was also tracing(691,11)(608,8)up(83,7)deeply mark(88,8)(1020,7) forehead.

But it was not this night in particular that,(1015,7) solitude(80,7)
cabin, Ahab(487,6)pondered(444,9)(216,7). A(310,6)every(105,7)they were
brought out;(352,8)(42,12)som(267,9)marks(822,6)effaced, and
other(25,7)substituted. For(553,10)(359,6) of all four oceans(911,7)

(660,6)re certain accomplishment(681,6)at monomaniac th(260,7)(427,6)soul.

Now, to any one not fully acquaint(775,12)ways(773,8)leviathans,
it m(329,6)eem an absurdly hopeless task(939,6)to seek out on(501,7)ary
creature(526,8)unhooped(322,8)of(583,6)planet. But not so did i(820,6)
to Ahab, who knew(948,6)e(407,10)tid(733,8)(364,7); and thereby
calculating(754,6)r(983,6)(252,9)sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling
to mi(88,6) regular, as(436,7)ed seasons for hunting him(803,14)
latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,(737,8)approaching to
(554,7)ties, concern(225,8)timeliest day to be(1008,8)is o(934,6)

So assured, indeed, is the fact(116,16)periodicalnes(598,8)

that,(298,7)he be closely observed and studied throughout(739,6)orld;

(867,11)s, guid(771,6)some infallible instinct—say, ra(66,6)secret
intelligenc(122,7)the Deity—mostly swim in _veins_, as they are called;
continuing their way along a given(679,6)-line with(814,6)undeviating
exac(674,6),(886,6)no ship ever sailed her(853,7), by any(880,6),(85,6)one
tithe of(912,6)marvellous(938,7)ion. Though,(871,7)se cases(345,6)direction taken(103,8)one(490,6) be straight as a surveyor’s parallel,
(591,6)ough th(700,6) of advanc(69,8)ictly confined to its own
unavoidable,(111,10)wake, yet the arbitrary(413,6)_(659,10)at(216,6)
times he is said to swim, generally embraces(571,6)few mile(737,6)idth
(more or less(513,8) vein is presum(190,6)expand or contract); but
never exceed(63,7)isual sweep(635,10)whale-ship’s mast-head(813,7)
circumspectly gliding(616,7)this magic zone. The sum is(592,7)at
particular seasons within(626,6)breadth and(86,9)at path, migr(682,6)(1009,6) may(715,6)great(454,6)de(477,7)looked for.

And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter h(409,6)y; but in crossing
the widest(430,6)ses of water between those (107,7) he(109,6), by his
art, so place an(190,6) himself on his way, as even then not to be
wholl(319,6)out prospect of a meeting.

There was a (509,7)tance(743,10)first sight see(648,8)ntangle his
delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,
perhaps. T(977,10)grega(87,6)sperm(699,6)s have their reg(619,12)
for (642,11)(458,9)yet in(914,8) you cannot conclude(705,6)the
herds(998,7)haunted suc(692,6)(9,6) latitud(947,6)ong(13,6)this year,
say, will turn ou(407,7) identically the same(740,6)(530,6)that were
found there the preceding(857,7); t(300,9)re are peculiar and
unquestionable in(473,6)s w(83,9)contrary of(990,6)has proved true. In
(309,7),(175,10)remark,(871,6)(990,7)a less wide limit, applies to the
solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged(499,13). So that
(243,7)Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what
is called the Seychell(911,8)(669,8)Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on
the Japanese Coast;(617,6)t did not follow,(470,10) the Pequod to
visit either(389,6)ose spots at any subsequent correspon(518,11), she
would infallibly encounter him(581,6). So, too,(624,6)some other feeding
(816,9)(547,6)he had at times revealed himself(978,6)all these seemed
only his casual stopping-plac(510,7)ocean-inns, so to speak, not his
(44,7)of prolonged abode. And(708,7)Ahab’s ch(729,6)of accomplishing
his object have hitherto(545,7)poken of, allusion has(727,6)been made to
whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects(489,6)his, ere a
particular se(333,6) or place(534,6)attained, when all possibilities(481,7)become proba(27,8), and, as Ahab fondly (808,6)t, every
(77,10)y the next thing to a certainty. That (178,20)and(406,6)(713,6)conjoine(815,9)one technical phrase—the
Season-on-the-Line. For(662,6) and th(939,8)several consecutive years,
(1012,14)been periodically descried, lingering(970,6)ose waters for
awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loi(53,8) a predicted
interval in any one sign(961,6)e Zodiac. There it was(889,7)that most of
the dead(943,12)s(924,6)the white whal(903,6)taken(565,6);(316,7)the
wave(627,7)storied(991,6)his deeds(45,8)also was(133,6)tragic spot
(1006,6)the monomaniac old man had fou(422,6) awful motive to his
vengeance. But(527,8)cautious comprehensiveness and un(351,6)ing
vigilance(253,6)which(718,6)threw his brooding soul into this unfal(72,7)hunt, he (814,6)not permit himself to rest all his hopes upo(707,9)
crowning fact above mentioned, however flat(191,6) it might be to(625,6)
hopes; nor(800,8)sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
unquiet heart as to postpone all (654,6)ening quest.

Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning(713,7)(953,21)No possible endeav(970,6)n(199,7)enable her
commander to mak(611,6)great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and
then ru(153,6)down sixty degrees of latitude arrive(642,8)equatorial
Pacific in time to cruise(841,6)(940,7)fore, he must wait f(222,6) next
ensuing season. Ye(318,6)premature hour(318,7)(380,7)’s sailing had,
perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab,(966,6)a view(599,6)is very
complexion(425,6)ings. Because, an(532,7)al(457,6)ree hundred and
sixty-five day(911,6)nights was before him;(76,13)which, instead
of impatiently enduring ash(327,8)(903,6)spend in a miscellaneous hunt;
if by chanc(545,6)White Whale,(61,6)ing(813,6)acation in seas far remote
from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow
of(444,8)rsian Gulf, (964,10)Bengal Bay, or China Seas(37,8)any
other waters haun(471,7)his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,
Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind bu(956,6)Levanter and Simoon,
might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle(1021,8)(703,9)circumnavigating wake.

But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it
not but a mad idea,(72,7)that(970,8)broad boundless ocean, one
solitary w(561,6)even if encountered(504,9)be thought capable of
individual recognition (593,9)hunter(90,7)as a white-be(227,6)Mufti
(545,7)thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar
snow-white brow of(448,10), and his (38,11)hump, could (333,8)be
unmistakable. And have I not tallied the(311,8)Ahab(944,7)mutter to
himself, as after poring over his charts till long(39,7)midnight he
(85,6)throw (81,7) back in reveries—(146,8)him(230,6)shall he escape?
His(519,7)fins are bored(47,7)calloped out like a lost sheep’s ear!
And here, his mad mind(248,7)run on in a breathles(946,6);(226,6)a
weariness and faintness of pondering came(291,8)m; and(712,8)open air
(868,6) deck he(377,7)seek to rec(353,9)strength. Ah, God! what
tranc(601,6)torments does(823,6)man endure who is consumed with one
unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps(49,6)clenched hands(212,6)wakes
with his own bloody nails in his palms.

Often, when forced(867,11)ammock by exhausting(313,7)tolerably vivid
dream(249,6)he night, which, resuming(145,9)intens(1015,9)s through
the day, carr(780,7)m on amid a clashing of phrensies(897,6)whirl(50,7)
round and (10,10)(20,6)(255,7)blazing brain,(810,6)the very throbbing
of his life-spot became insufferable anguish(383,7)hen, as was
sometimes the case, these spiritual throe(407,7)m heaved(163,6)eing up
from its base(904,6)a chasm seemed opening(69,7),(450,6)which forked
flame(799,6)lightnings shot up(84,7)ccursed fiends beckon(1022,6) to leap
down among them;(569,6)this hell(199,7)self yawned beneath(153,6)a wild
cry(990,7)be heard(514,8) the ship(717,7)ith glaring eyes Ahab(921,6)
burst(686,10)state room, as(604,7) escaping(726,6)a bed(909,6)was on
fire. Yet(409,6), perhaps, instead of(395,7)the unsuppressable symptoms
of some latent weakness, or fright at(913,9)resolve, were but the
plainest tokens of its(813,7)ity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the
scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter(938,8)white whale;(456,6)Ahab
that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent(339,6)so caus(563,9)(418,12)it in horror again. The latter wa(804,6)eternal, living

league(862,7)the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s
case, yielding up all hi(888,8)ts and fancies(577,8)one supreme
purpose;(910,6)(14,7), by it(806,6)sheer inveteracy of will, forced
itself(590,6)st god(118,6)devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent
(991,6)(879,7)own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while(594,6)ommon

CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.

So far as(469,6)there may be of a narrativ(226,7)is book; an(767,7)ed,
as indirectly touching one or two(160,6)interesting and curious
particulars(328,7) habits of sperm whales(693,6)foregoing chapter, in
its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found(216,8)
volume; but the leading matter(985,6) requires(639,8)till further and
more familiarly enlarged upon, in order(703,7)adequately understood,
and moreov(42,6)take away any incredulity which a pro(206,7)gnorance of
the entire su(789,6)may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity
of the main poin(408,6)this affair.

I care not to perform(560,6)part of my task methodically(366,6)shall be
conten(67,6)roduc(733,6)desired impression by separate citations of
items, pract(100,6) or reliably known to me as a(601,6)man(953,6)from
thes(86,11), I(385,6)it—the conclusion aimed at(594,6)(311,7)ly
follow(563,6)self.

First: I have personal(146,10)hree instances where(159,8), after
receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape(937,7)after an
interval (in on(115,10)(467,6)ree years)(89,6)been again struck by the
same h(92,6)nd slain; whe(959,6)two irons, both marked(61,7) same
private cypher,(280,6)been taken from the body. I(89,6)(175,9)where
(178,11) (219,6)ened betwe(139,7)flinging(692,6)(155,6)(317,7)s(501,6)I
think i(798,6)(137,10)something more than that;(784,7)n who darted
them happening, i(177,8)(369,6), to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
Africa, went ash(122,6)ere, joined a discovery party(388,6)penetrated far
in(974,7)interior,(597,7)he travelled for a period of nearly two(520,6),
often endanger(453,6)serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with
all the other common perils incid(1016,7)wandering(321,8)heart of
un(957,6)regions. Meanwhile, the(970,6) he had(686,8)must also(607,10)
on its(260,7)s; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,
brushing with its flanks (229,8)coasts of (462,6); but to no purpose.
This man and this(194,7)(879,6)came together(869,6)the one vanquish(149,6)
other. I say I, myself(849,7)(307,6)(985,6)(1003,8)s similar to this;
that is in two(811,7)m I saw(349,10)s(343,7); and, upo(1006,6)second
attack,(52,9)two irons(296,6)the respective marks cut(810,7)m,
afterwards taken from the dead fish. I(983,6)three-year(216,9), it so
fell out that I wa(217,6)he boat both times, first and last(360,9)
last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the
whale’s eye, which I had observ(599,6)r(206,7)(882,6) previous(467,7)
(28,11), but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here a(94,8)
(511,9), then(144,10)personally kno(444,7)ruth of(698,6)I(831,6)heard
of many(970,7)(597,10)from(76,7)s whose veracity(972,8)matt(282,6)re
is no good ground to impeach.

Secondly: It is well(719,7)(461,7)Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
the world ashore may be of it,(548,6)(389,6)have been several memorable
historical(839,11)where a particular(963,7)(622,7)ocean has(86,6)at
distan(602,6)s and places popularly (611,6)able. Why such a(89,7)became
thus marked was not altogether and origi(469,6)owing to his bodily
(702,8)ities as(743,7)guished(889,6)(481,6)(1018,6); for(349,9)(764,8)
i(620,6)(984,8) any chance(266,7)(365,6), they soon put an e(496,6)his(140,15)by killing him(914,6)boi(17,8) d(514,6)to(900,11)ly
valuable oil. No: the reason was this:(495,6)from the fatal experiences
of(25,6)(591,6)(537,8)ung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
(434,13)as(995,7)did(32,6) Rinaldo(8,7)ini, insomuch(655,6)most
(131,6)men were content to re(548,6)e him by merely touching their
tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them o(940,6)sea,
without seek(581,7)cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some
poor devils(900,8)that happen to know an irascible great man(571,6)
make (830,8)unobtrusive salutations(739,6)m(894,8)street, lest if(72,6)pursued th(176,14) further(682,7)might receive a summary thump
for(356,6) presumption.

But not only did each (595,6)se famous(849,7) enjoy(232,7)individual
celebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown;(117,10)was he
(106,7)in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
but he was admitted(889,7)ll(862,6)ights, privileges(943,6)distinctions
of a name; had as m(800,6)name indeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it not
so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so
long did’st lurk(556,8)Oriental straits(437,6)at name, whose spout was
oft seen from the palmy b(497,8)Ombay?(193,11) (193,6)New Zealand
Jack(200,7)terror of all cruisers(806,6)cross(690,6)ir wakes(738,7)

(221,6)lofty jet(769,6)say at times assum(821,7)semblance of a snow-white
cross against(898,6)k(260,20)Don Miguel(454,7)Chilian(793,6),
mark(451,11)old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upo(1015,6)back! In
plain prose, here are four(899,8)as well known to(225,6)tudents of
Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla(55,8)classic scholar.

But this is not all.(513,12) Tom and(273,11),(897,7)at various
(386,6)creating great havoc among(244,6)oa(692,6)different vessels, were
finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed
by valiant whaling captains(867,6)heaved up(687,7)anchors(440,6)that
express object as much in view, as in setting out through the
Narragansett Woods, C(130,6) Butler of old had it in his mind to capture
(988,6)otorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warri(936,6)the
Indian(847,6)Philip.

I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important(326,7)
printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness(229,8)whole (766,6)(248,6) White Whale, more especially(780,6)atastrophe. For
(775,8)one(317,6)ose dishearten(146,6)stances(308,7)truth requires full
(557,8)bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of
the plainest and(42,6)palpable wonder(256,8) world, that without some
hints touchi(903,7)plain facts, historical and(444,6)wise,(575,8)fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still
worse(199,7)re det(489,6)e, a hideous and intolerable allegory.

First: Though(309,6)men have(306,6)vague fli(914,6)idea(285,9)general
peril(22,10)rand (223,9)yet(227,6)have nothing like a fixed, vivid
concep(761,8)(550,6)(91,6), and the frequency with(773,8)hey recur.
On(715,8) perhaps is(449,7)not one in fift(722,9)actual disasters
and deaths by casualties in(134,6)(444,8)ever finds a public record at
home, however transien(630,6)immediately forgotten(616,6)(65,6). Do you
suppose(644,6)that poor fellow there, who this moment(252,9)caught by
the whale-line of(974,6)coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to
the bottom(801,8)sea b(1016,6)sounding leviathan—do you (195,12)
(195,16)’s name will appear(360,8)newspaper obituary you will
read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very
irregular between her(844,6)(268,10). I(979,6), did you(500,6)hear what
(954,6)be called (85,8)news direct or in(12,7)from(365,11)? Yet I
tell you(682,6)upon one particular voyage(755,7)I made to the Pacific,
among many others we spoke thirty different ships(707,6)y one of(848,6)
had had a(773,6) by a(572,6), some(1024,7)m more than one(933,8)re(489,7)had each lost a boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical(989,6)your
lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at leas(999,6)drop of
man’s blood was spilled for it.

Secondly: People ashore have indeed(248,6)indefinite idea(943,6)(283,7)
is an enormous creature of(21,10)power; but I(95,6)ever found(798,6)when narrating(481,7)m(375,6)specific exampl(392,7)is two-fold
(126,8)ness, they(197,6)significantly complimented me(622,6)my
faceti(63,7); when, I declar(39,9) soul, I had no(517,6)idea of
being (73,9)(541,6)Moses, when he wrot(914,6)history(592,7) plagues of
Egypt.

But fortunately th(263,7)al point I(951,6)seek can be established upon
testimony entirely independent of my own. That(89,7)is this: The Sperm
Whale is in(777,6)cases sufficiently(483,6)ful, knowing(792,6)judiciously
mal(12,6), as(748,6)direct aforethought to st(643,6), utterly destroy,
and sink a large ship; and what is more, t(191,8) (191,6)_has_ done(766,6)First: In the year 1820(363,6)hip Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,
was cruising i(77,6)Pa(688,6)Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her
boats(307,6)gave chase to a shoal of sperm(886,6)s. Ere long, several of
the(33,7) were wounded(725,8)suddenly, a very(323,7)whale escaping
from the (149,7)issued (23,9)shoal(479,6)bore(453,7)ly down(854,6)the
ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that
in les(850,7)“ten minutes”(336,6)ettled(123,6)and fell over. Not a
surviving plank of(119,6)as been seen since. After(877,6)everest
exposure, part(947,8)crew reached the land(511,7)ir(313,6). Being
returned home at last(600,17) once more sailed fo(139,6)(590,7)
in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him(366,6) upon
unknown rocks(450,6)reakers;(112,9)second time hi(79,6) was(908,8)
lost(990,6)forthwith forswearing(320,7)a, he has never tempted it(366,7)
At this day(270,17)is a resident(883,13). I have seen
Owen Chace, who was chief mate(431,8)Essex a(292,6)tim(25,9)tragedy;
(84,7)read his plai(593,7)aithful narrative;(130,8)conversed with his
son; and all(222,6)within a few miles(581,8)scen(163,9)catastrophe.*

*The following are extracts(905,6)Chace’s(150,10): “Every fact seemed
to warrant me in conclud(423,6)at it was anything but chance which
(989,6)e(278,6)operations; he made two(814,6)al attacks upon(839,6)hip, at
a short interval between them, both of(116,6), accor(165,6)o(851,6)(136,7)ion, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made

before entere(272,7)in(41,14)struck three of his companions, as

Here are his refl(777,6)s som(228,6) after quitt(717,9)hip, during a

I(27,6)now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance

Captain(267,11) thus(58,6)s(1006,6)eventeenth chapter:

“B(189,6)thir(29,7)of May our ship was ready to sail, and(660,7)xt day
we were out(181,8)open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was
very clear and fine(695,6)so intolerably cold(837,7)(118,8)bliged to
keep(113,8)fur clothing. For some days we had very(549,8)wind; it was
not till(891,6)ine(314,7)that a brisk gale(750,6)the northwest sprang up.
An uncommon large(854,6)(758,6)body of which was(35,6)r tha(506,6)ship

D’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the
vessel had re(649,6) any damag(828,11)shock(698,7)e foun(995,7)very

In(863,6)up and down manly book of old-fash(302,6)(464,9), so full,
too, of honest wonders—the voy(457,6) Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
Dampier’s old chums—I(763,7)a little matter set(167,6)so like(796,6)just

corroborative example, if such be needed.

(213,6), it seems(499,6)on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the
modern Juan Fernandes. “In our(73,6)hither,”(456,6)ys, “about four

seems to substantia(54,7)imput(623,6)by stating(634,6)a great

me,(657,8)(299,6)power and malice (347,7)(696,10)perm(177,6). In more
than one instance, he has been(111,6), not only to chas(762,6)assailing

not so(101,7)with blind rage, as(792,6)wilful, deliberate designs of
destruction to his(615,7)rs; nor is it without conveying some eloquent
indication of his character(511,7)upon being(481,6)ked he will
frequently open his mouth(732,6)retain it i(637,7)dread expansion for
(1024,8)consecutive minutes. But I must be conten(214,6)(916,6)one(972,6)and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,
by which you will not fail to see(788,7)not(128,6)is the(78,6)marvellous

In(954,6)ixth Christian century lived Procopius, a(37,11)magistrate
of Constantinople,(573,6)e days when Justinian was Emperor and
Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history(763,8)own
times, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he
has always been considered a(636,6)trustworthy and unexaggerating
(155,6)ian, except in(956,6)one or two particulars, not at all affecting
the matter(606,8)ly to be mentioned.

Now(360,7)is(278,15),(437,10)(51,8)s that, during the term
(327,7)prefecture at(462,17)a great sea-monster was captured
(495,7)neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed
vessels at intervals(915,6)ose waters for a period of more than fifty
years. A fact thus set down in sub(683,6)al(589,9)cannot easily be
gainsaid. Nor is(848,7)any reason it should be. Of what precise species
this(311,16), is not(462,11) But as he(269,10) ships, as
well a(250,6)other(133,7)s, he must have(695,6)a whale; and I am strongly
inclined to think a sperm(51,6). And I will tell you why. For a long
time I fancied that the(73,12) had(141,7)(848,6)unkn(383,7)the

CHAPTER 46. Surmises.

Though, consumed wit(799,6)hot fire of his purpose, Ahab(125,7) his
thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate captu(91,6)Moby
Dick; (73,6) he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that
one passion; nevertheless it ma(288,12)that he was by nature and
long habituation far too wedded to a fiery(852,6)man’s ways, al(599,8)
to aband(593,6) collateral prosecution(931,8)voyage. Or at least if
this were otherwise, there(22,6)not wanting(34,6) motives much more
influential(476,6)him. It would be refin(707,6)o much, perhaps, even
considering his monomania, to hint(335,7)is vindictiveness towards the
White Whale might(976,6)possibly extended itself in some degree(865,7)
(727,11)s(956,6)that the more (864,7)s he slew by s(216,6)(37,10)he
multiplied(416,6)hances(918,6)each subsequently encountered(851,6)(319,6)
prove to b(947,6)hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be
indeed exceptionabl(485,14)still additional (399,8)a(874,6)which,(902,7) not so strictly according(985,10)wildness(985,8)ruling
(825,7), yet(629,6)by no means incapable of sway(525,6)m.

To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all(18,6) used in
the shadow(790,8)moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,
for examp(327,6)at however magnetic his ascendency(616,9)respects was
over Starbuck(276,6)that(56,12)did not cover(997,7)mplete spiritual

(724,6)h(436,6)(961,6)for(533,6)his(914,7)ief mate, in his soul, abhorred
his captain’s quest, and could he,(934,6) joyfully disintegrate himself
from it, or even frustrate it. It might(995,6)at a(241,6)interval(100,6)
elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During(663,6)(69,14)(619,8)

(279,10)lead(574,6), unless(750,6)ordinary, prudential, circumstantial
influences(501,6)brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle
insanity of(550,6)(876,7)ing Moby Dick was noways(815,6)significantly
manifested(840,6)(532,8)uperlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing

full terror(90,6)e voyage must be(846,6)withdrawn(515,6)the obscure
background (for few men’s courage is proof(543,9)protracted
meditation unrelieved by action)(171,7)when they stood their(1014,6)night
watches, his officers and men(204,6)have(633,6)nearer things to think of
than(527,10). For however eagerly and impetuously(613,6)avage crew had
hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of(15,6)orts are
more or less capriciou(216,6)(303,6)able—they live in(451,6)arying outer
weather, and(325,6)inhale its fickleness—and(361,6)retained for any
object remot(734,6)blank(111,8)pursuit,(299,9)promissory of life and

suspend(224,7)the final dash.

Nor was Ahab unmindful of anoth(569,8). In times of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base considerations; but such(74,7)are evanescent.
The permanent constitutional condition(954,8)manufactured man, thought
Ahab, is sordidness. Granting(355,7)he White Whale fully incites the
hearts(109,6)is my(759,12)(606,6)playing rou(620,6)ir(796,7)ness even
breeds a certain generous knight-errantism(719,7)m, still, while for
the love of it(726,6)give chase to(966,10),(756,6)must also have food
(512,7)ir more common, daily appetites. For eve(861,6)high lifted and
chivalric Crusade(970,6)old(543,7)were not content to traverse two
thousand mil(591,6)land to fight(679,8)ir holy sepulchre, without
committing burglaries, picking pockets(420,6)gaining (716,6)pious
per(880,7)s by the way. Had(348,6)been strictly held to(481,7)on(834,7)
and romantic object—that(865,7)(31,19), too many would have
turned from in disgust. I will not strip these me(747,10) (747,6)of
all hop(928,6)cash—aye, cash. They may scorn cash now(913,6)let some
months go by(737,6)no perspective promis(646,9)o(687,7)a(765,6)n this
same qui(981,6)(108,6)all at once mutinying(752,10)this same(154,6)would
soo(170,6)ier Ahab.

Nor was there w(977,7)still an(483,7)recautionary motive(753,6)related
to Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable(1011,7)erhaps
somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpo(319,6)the
Pequod’s voyage,(149,6)was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he
had indirectly laid himself open(698,7) unanswerable charge of
usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both mor(728,7)legal, his crew
if so disposed(531,7)o that end competent, could refuse all further
obedience to hi(601,7)even violently wrest(811,6)him the command. From
even the barely hinted imputation of (245,10)(702,9) possible
consequenc(845,6)such a suppress(77,6)ression gaining ground(452,7)must
of course have been most anx(463,6)o protect(432,8). T(595,6)otection

backed by a heedful, closely calcul(67,6)attention to every minute
atmospheric influence which it was(321,9) for(538,9) to be
subjected to.

For all these reasons the(400,7)others(877,8) too analytic(81,7)verbally developed her(837,8)plainly saw(644,6)he must still in a good
degree continue true(817,8)natural, nominal(960,15) (960,8)

B(879,6)this as it may(964,6)voice was now often heard hailing the three
mast-heads and admonish(37,7)m to keep a bright look-out(976,6)not omit
reporting(995,6)a porpoise. This vigilan(152,9)t long without reward.


CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.

I(667,6)a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
about the decks, or vacantly gazing over in(569,7)lead-coloured waters.
Queequeg and I(108,6)mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,
for an additional la(383,7)o our boat. So(749,7)and subdued and yet
somehow preluding(294,6)(914,6) scene(905,6)such an incantation of reverie
lurked(645,8)air,(879,6)each silent sailor seemed resolved(302,6)his own
invisible self.

I was(85,6)ttendant or page of (332,8), while busy a(422,6)mat. As I
kept(821,6)n(374,6)re(14,8)the filling or woof of marline between the

and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess
did there then reign all(776,6)(259,6)ip(255,6)(22,13)ea, only
broken by the intermitting dull sound(368,8)sword(602,7)it(586,8)as

Thus we were (481,7) (1024,8)ing away when I started at a sound so
strange, long drawn(599,6)musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of
(441,10)dropp(547,8)my hand(682,6)I stood gazing up (69,7)clouds
whence(92,6)voice(76,9)like a wing. High alof(972,9)cross-trees
was(158,6)mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly
forward, his hand stretched out(140,9)(215,9)at brief sudden
intervals he continued his cries. T(844,6)ure the same(402,7)(190,8)
very moment perhaps being heard all over(65,6)eas,(916,6)hundreds of
whalemen’s look-outs perched as high(323,8)air; but(986,6)few of those
lungs could(504,6)accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous
cadence as(535,6)(396,8) the Indian’s.

As he(550,7)hovering(231,6)you half suspend(975,6)air, so wildly and
(455,7) pe(62,6)towards the horizon, you would(185,6)(949,6)t him some
prophet or seer beholding(432,6)hadows of Fate(948,6)by(303,6)(815,6)cries
announc(56,7)ir coming.

“There she blows! there(7,7)(14,9)(32,11)(43,10)”

“Where-away?”

“O(776,6)lee-beam, about two miles off! a school(475,6)em!”

Instantly all was commotion.

The Sperm Whal(172,7) as a clock ticks, with(715,10)undeviating and
reliable uniformity. And(244,6)by (681,8) distinguish this fish from
other tribes of his genus(334,10)go flukes!” was now the cry(631,14); a(126,6)(122,6)s
disappeared.

“Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”

Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at(106,6)atch(555,6)reporte(130,6)exact

our bows. For(127,6)singular craft at times evince(855,7)(645,13)
when, sounding(636,6)his head in one(129,7)ion, he nevertheless, while
concealed benea(704,8)urface, mills rou(355,9)wiftly swims off in
the opposite quarter—this deceitfulnes(688,9)could not now be in
action; for(1021,6)(699,7) reason to suppose(432,10)fish seen by
(473,9)had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our
vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not
appoint(528,6)the boats,(450,6)is time reliev(763,7)Indian(801,7)
main-mast head. The sailors(836,8)fore and mizzen had com(689,6); the
line tubs were fixed in their places; the crane(39,7)thrust out(70,6)mainyard was backe(873,7)the thre(222,7) swung over(575,6)ea lik(36,7)

poised on the gunwale. So look the long li(516,6)man-of-war’s men about
to throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.

Bu(981,6)his critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard(752,7)ook
every eye from the whale. With a star(723,6)glared at dark Ahab, who was
surrounded by five dusky phantoms(868,6)seemed fresh formed out of air.


CHAPTER 48(681,6)First Lowering.

The(85,9),(831,6)o they then(98,7),(677,7)litting(412,8)other side

been d(281,6)o(546,6)the spar(1003,9)though technically call(1007,6)
captain’s, on account of its hanging(480,10)star(597,6)quarter. The
figure(539,6)now stood by its bows was tall and swart(309,7)one white
tooth evilly protrud(125,9)its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese
jacket of black cotton funereally invested him(440,7)wide(48,6)
trowser(397,9)same(691,6)stuff. But strangely crowning(842,6)ebonness
was a glistening(225,6) plaited turban,(989,6)iving hair braided and
coiled round an(10,8)upon his head. Less(334,6) in aspect,(471,6)ompanion(600,7)is (421,7)wer(552,7)at vivid, tiger-yellow complexion
peculiar to som(608,9)aboriginal native(702,9)Manillas;—a race
notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty,(783,6)y(109,6)honest(542,7)mariners supposed to be the paid spi(847,7)secret confidential agents
(972,7)water(881,8)devil, their lord, whose counting-ro(767,6)y(125,8)

While yet(97,6)ondering ship’s (400,6)y(382,6)gazing(461,6)these
(595,7)rs, Ahab cried out to(178,6)hite-(570,6)ed old man at(184,7)head,
“All ready there, Fedallah?”

“Ready,”(909,6)he half-hissed reply.

“Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting acros(70,6)deck. (56,11)
(124,7)I say.”

Such(117,9)thund(382,6)his voice,(654,6)spit(612,8)ir amazement the
men sprang over the rail;(937,6)heaves whir(825,10)i(495,6)blocks; with
a wallow(896,6)three boats dropped in(373,7)sea; while, with a
dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocatio(1009,6)
sailors, goat-like, leaped dow(671,6)roll(572,11)side(149,10)tossed
(179,6)below.

Hardly had(680,6)pull(577,7)from (371,6)(297,6)ip’s lee, when a fourth
keel, coming(54,6)the windward side,(89,8)(351,6)(86,11)tern, and
showed the five (731,9) rowing Ahab, who, standing erect(431,7)
(77,7)lou(212,6)iled Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spre(253,6)mselves
widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But(486,7)ll(854,6)
eyes again riveted(949,9) swart(864,9) and his cre(603,7)inmates of
the(525,7)(618,6)obeyed not the command.

“Captain Ahab?—” sai(252,10).

“S(233,6)your(233,6),” cried Ahab; “give way, all fou(117,7). Thou,
(308,7)pull out more to leeward!”

“Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily(106,7)little King-Post, sweeping(888,7)his
great steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing(312,9).
“There!—t(7,7)here(385,6)! There s(976,6)ws right ahead, boys!—lay
(95,6)

“Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”

“Oh, I don’t mind ’em(250,8)said(43,6); “I knew it all before now.
Didn’t I hear ’em(716,7) hold? And d(35,8)tell Cabaco here of it?
What say ye,(32,7)? They are stowaways, Mr.(762,6).”

“Pull(920,6), my fine hearts-alive;(28,10)children(19,11)(459,6)
ones,” drawlingly and sooth(15,6)sighed(892,6) to(747,11)som(838,6)hom
still showed signs of uneasiness. “Why(364,7)you break your backbones,
my boys? What is i(46,6)stare at? Those chaps in(481,8)boat? Tut! They
are only five(746,6)hands come to help us—never(509,6)from where—th(53,6)
the merrier. (369,6)then, do pull; (65,11)the brimstone—devils are
good fellows enough. So, so; (747,6)you a(597,6); that’s the stroke for a
thousand pounds(41,20)to(915,6)(61,7)akes! Hurrah for the
gold cup of sperm oi(580,6)heroes! Three(1021,6)s, men—all(605,7) alive!
Easy, easy;(835,7)be in a hurry—(20,19). (516,14)snap

steel-bits. Start her—(246,6)her, my silver-spoons!(39,10),
marling-spikes!”

Stubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had
rather a peculiar way of talking to them in genera(429,7)especially in
inculcating the religi(374,6)rowing. Bu(887,6)must not suppos(447,7)this
specimen of his sermonizings(342,6)he ever flew into downright passions
with(266,6)ongregation. Not at all; and therein consisted(318,6)hief
(271,8)ity. He would say the most terrific th(160,6)(382,10), in a
tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury(920,6)the fury seemed so
calculated merely as a spice(414,7) fun,(630,6)no oarsman could hear
such queer invocations without pulling for dear l(796,9)ye(31,9)
for(254,6)ere joke of the(257,6). Besides he all(26,6)ime looked so easy
and indolent himself, so loungingly manag(401,7)steering-oar(945,6)so
broadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—that(177,10)sight of such a
yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted(975,6)a charm upon
the crew. Then again, Stubb was on(295,7)ose odd sort of humorists,
whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all
inferiors on their guard in(688,6)atter of obey(933,7)m.

In obedien(589,6)a sign(914,6)Ahab, Starbuck was now(557,9)obliquely
across(244,6)’s bow(864,6)when for a minute or s(690,6)two boats were
pretty near to each other(331,8)haile(800,6)mate.

“Mr.(158,9)! larboard bo(502,6)re, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
please!”

“Halloa!” returned(251,9), turning round not a single inch as he
spoke; still earnestly but whisper(733,6)urging his crew; his face set
(611,7)flint(393,6)(345,7).

“W(723,6)ink y(600,11)yellow boys, sir!”

“Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, s(8,6)
boys!)” in a(198,8) to(189,9), then speaking out loud(777,6): “A sad
business, (438,6)ubb! (seethe her, (12,12)my lads!) but never mind,
(62,9), all for the best. Let all your cre(684,6)(203,8) come what
will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.
(136,8)nd that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my (329,6) Sperm,(77,6)’s the
play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”

“Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized(313,8)when(310,6)oats
diverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em(97,12)so. (121,6)(253,9)
what he went int(1000,6)after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
suspected. They were hidden down(982,6). The White Whale’s (1010,6) bottom
of it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men!
It ain’(92,6)(113,11) to-day(48,10)!”

Now(241,6)dvent(923,6)ese outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
as the lowering(73,7)(428,6) from the deck, this had not unreasonably
awakened a sort of superstitious amazem(427,6) some(105,8)ship’s
company; but Archy’s fancied discovery having(65,6)time previous got
abroad among them,(675,7) indee(184,6)credited then(212,11)(152,7)
small measure prepar(46,6)m(1024,9)event. It took of(309,6)extreme edge
(402,6)ir wonder; and so(949,6)with all(339,6)an(813,7)’s confident way of
accounting(127,8)ir appearance, t(700,9)(159,8)time freed from
(395,14)surmisings;(287,8)(826,6)fair still left abundant room
for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in
the matter(606,10)beginning. For me, I silently recall(433,6)
myster(200,6)hadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod duri(536,6)
dim Nantucket dawn, as well (785,7)enigma(812,6)hintings(870,7)
un(405,7)able Elijah.

Meantime, Ahab, out of hea(858,8)his officers,(717,9)id(221,7)furthest to windward, was(406,7)ranging ahead(938,8)other(944,6); a
circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger
yellow crea(476,6)(190,7)seemed all steel and whalebone; like five
trip-hammers(676,6)rose and fell(771,6)regular strok(102,6)strength, which
periodically star(956,7) boat al(1004,7) water(128,6)a horizontal burst
boiler(403,8)a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who(383,6)een
(300,8)the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and
displayed his naked chest(273,6)the whole par(575,6)is body above the
gunwale, clearly cut against(972,6)lternating depression(704,8)(299,6)y
(293,7); while a(60,6)(592,6)en(609,9)boat(722,7)with one arm,(364,7)
fencer’s,(255,8)half backward into(149,6)ir, as if to counterbalance
any tendency to trip; Ahab(385,9) steadily manag(695,6)s stee(864,6)ar
as in a thousand(549,6)lowerings ere the White Whal(441,7)orn(773,6)All
at onc(42,6)outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained
fixed,(349,7)(689,8)’s five oars were(219,7)imultaneously peaked. Boat
and(945,6)sat(110,7)less on the sea. Instantly the three sprea(258,6)s in
the rear paused(64,7)ir way. The(968,6)s had ir(923,7)ly settled bodily
down(470,10)blue, thus giving no di(143,8)discernible token(644,7)
movement, though from his closer vicinity(517,6)had observed it.

“Every man look out alo(534,7)oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,
stand up!”

Nimbly springing up(357,8)triangular raised box i(386,6)bow,(395,6)avage
stood erect there, and(992,6)intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
spot wh(691,8)chas(685,6)last been descried. Likewise up(536,7)extreme
ster(374,8)(972,6)(84,6)it was also(223,11)ly platformed level with
the gunwale,(337,9) himself(932,10)coolly and adroitly (996,6)ing
(47,8)(572,7)jerking tossings of(514,6)hip of a craft(319,6)silently
eyeing the vast blue eye(228,8)sea.

Not very far(656,8) Flask’s(263,7)(254,8)lying breathlessly still;
its commander reck(32,9)and(547,6)(546,8)op(357,8)loggerhead, a
stout sort of post rooted(575,8)keel(546,6)rising some two feet above
the(398,7)(230,8)tern(428,9). It is used for catching turns(636,6)the
whale line. Its top is not more spacious tha(763,6)palm(397,6)man’s hand,
and(261,15)such a base as that,(369,6) seemed perched at the
mast-head of(244,6)ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little
King-Pos(720,6)small(561,6)hor(572,7)(114,6) same time(59,7) (59,9)
was full(631,6)large and tall ambition, so that this(488,11)
stand-point(709,8)did by no means satisfy(116,10).

“I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there(781,6)let me on to
that.”

U(1019,6)is, Daggoo,(504,6)either hand(688,10)(972,7) to steady his way,
swiftly slid (896,9)then erecting(1017,9)volunteered (276,6)fty
shoulders for a pedestal.

“Good a (510,10)as any, sir. Will you mount?”

“That I wil(807,7)thank ye(992,6)much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
fifty(849,6)taller.”

Whereupon plan(216,7)s(887,6)firmly against two opposite planks(1007,7)
boat,(340,6)igantic negro, stooping a(684,7), present(302,7)flat(865,6)to
Flask’s foo(371,12)putting(843,6)(896,7) on his hearse-plumed head
and bidd(421,7) spring as he(438,9)(416,6) toss(548,7)one dexterous
fling landed th(816,9)man high and dry(136,8)(496,9). And here was(211,6) now standing(667,8)(118,10)lifted arm furnish(187,8)with a
breastband to lean(406,9)and(702,10)(657,6)by.

At any(1003,6)it is a strange sight to the tyro to see(812,6)what wondrous
habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain a(811,7)
posture i(433,6)(556,6)even when pitched about by the most riotously
perverse and cross-running seas. Still more(229,9)(211,7)him giddi(71,6)ched upon(468,6)oggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the
(318,6)of(530,8)(482,6)mount(92,8)(774,9)(490,8)as yet more
curious; for sustain(683,7)self(500,7) cool, indifferent, easy,
unthou(132,6), barbaric majesty(903,6)noble(900,6) to every roll(946,8)sea harmoniousl(29,6)(915,8)ine form. O(436,7)road back, flaxen-haired(735,7)seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked(150,6)r tha(383,6)rider.
Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious(377,14)would now
and then stamp(981,6)impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby
give(797,8)negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity
stamping(614,6)iving magnanimous earth, b(595,6)(15,6) did not alter her
tides and her seasons for that.

Meanwhile Stubb(509,6)third mate, betrayed no(725,6)far-gazing
solicitudes(430,6)whales might(226,6)made one(567,7)ir regular soundings,
not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,
(189,7)as his wont in(901,7)ases, it seems, was resolved to solace the
languishing interval(847,6)his pipe. He withdrew it(167,6)his hatband,
where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed
hom(227,6)loading(137,10)thumb-end(659,6)hardly had he ignit(905,6)
match across(817,6)ough sandpaper of(188,7)nd, when Tashtego, his
harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward(225,6)two fixed
stars, suddenly droppe(39,7)ligh(324,11)erect attitude to his seat,
crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down all(339,6)give
way!—th(570,7)y are!”

To a landsman, no(711,6), nor any sign of a herring, would(964,6)been
visible at(671,6)moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
water(515,6)thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over(567,8)
suffusingly blowing off to leeward,(412,7)he confused scud(876,6)(133,6)rolling billow(984,7)air around(456,10)vibrated(176,6)ingled, as it
were(109,11)air(171,7)ntensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this
atmospheric waving and curling(812,6)partially b(59,7)a(317,6)layer of(342,9)lso, the(478,6)s were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
indications(72,6)(405,15)they spouted, seemed their forerunning
couriers and detached fl(733,8)riders.

All four boat(175,7)now in keen pursu(584,6)that one spo(17,6)(617,7)(595,6) and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as
a mas(424,6)nterblend(728,6)bbles borne(884,7) rapid stream(988,6)the
hills.

“Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest pos(869,6)but
(586,7)st concent(652,6)whisper to his men; whil(757,6)sharp fixed glance
from his eyes darted straight ahead(354,6)e bow, almost(479,8)as two(1022,9)needles in two unerr(844,6)nnacle compasses. He did not say much
(182,7)crew, though, nor did(26,9) say anything(233,6)m. Only the
sile(704,7)(181,6)at was at(443,6)vals startlingly pierced by one of his
peculiar(338,8)s, now harsh with command(24,6)soft(23,6)entreaty.

How different(458,7)ud little King-Post. “S(765,7) and say something,
my hearties. Roa(719,6)(575,9)thunderbolts! Beach me, b(10,7) on
(902,6)black backs, boys; only do(833,6)for me, and I’ll sign ov(591,6)you
my Martha’s Vineyard plantation(86,8)including wife and children,
boys. Lay(156,6)—l(10,8)! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring
mad! See! see(192,6)white water!” And so shouting, he pulle(586,6)hat(764,10)head(248,6)stamped up and(977,6)on it; then picking it up,
flirted it far off upo(950,6)sea; and finally fell to rearing and
plunging(1003,8)boat’s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.

“Look at(453,6)chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who,(714,6)his
unlighted short pipe, mechan(64,7)retained between his teeth, at a
(58,6)distance, followed after—“He’s got fits,(629,6)Flask has. Fits?
yes, give him fits—that’s the very word—pitch fits into ’em. Merrily,
m(9,7)(827,6)s-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;—merry(105,7)word.
Pull, babes—(882,6)suckling(16,8)all. But wha(996,6)devil are you
hurrying about? Softly, s(8,7)(629,6)eadily, my men. Only(995,7)and

knives in two(339,8)all. Take it easy—why don’t ye t(26,11), I
sa(178,7)burst(117,10)livers and lungs!”

(276,9)it was(931,6)inscrutable Ahab said to(961,6)tiger-yellow crew of
his—these wer(408,6)s best omitted here; for you live under(849,6)lessed

Meanwhile, all(231,6)oats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of
(889,6)to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he
declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow(284,6)its
tail(476,7)(155,12) his(493,6)at times so vivid(611,6)ife-like, that
they would cause some one or two(83,8)men to snatch a fearful look

I(916,6)a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells(837,7)
omnipotent sea;(317,6)urging, hollow roar(195,7)ade, as(209,6)rolled
along(914,6)ight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless

a wild hen after her screaming brood(240,8)(1014,7)thrilling.

Not the raw recruit, marching from(615,7)som of his wife(478,9) fever
heat(32,8)first battle; n(98,7)dead man’s ghost encount(323,6)the
(56,6)unknown phantom(1010,7)(446,6) world;—neither(949,7)se can feel
strang(1001,7)stronger emotions than(738,6)man does, who for(205,6)irst
time finds himself pulling(247,10)charmed, churned circl(853,8)

The dancing white water made by(88,8)se was now becoming more and
more visible, ow(916,7)the increasing darknes(719,9)dun cloud-shadows
flung(619,6)the sea. The jets of vapor no l(323,6)blended, but tilted
everywhere to right and left(989,6)whales seemed separat(496,7)ir wakes.
The(748,8)ere pulled(243,7)part; Starbuck giving(294,7)to thre(103,8)

rising wind, we rushed along(211,6)boat go(38,6)th such madness through
th(476,7),(622,6)the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to
escape be(487,6)rn(915,10)row-locks.

Soon we(319,6)(262,8)(140,7) a suffu(216,7)de veil of mist; (844,7)

“Give way, men,” whispered(409,9), drawing(328,6) further aft the
sheet of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before(672,6)quall
comes. There’s(837,13)again!—close to! Spring!”(287,7)af(399,6)wo cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted

with a lightning-like hurtling(347,8)(754,10)said: “Stand up!” and
Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.

Though not one of(203,6)arsmen was then fac(926,7) life and death peril

the erected crests of enraged serpents.

“That’s his hump. _There_, _t(9,7)give it(518,6)m!(947,11)

A short rush(285,10)leaped out(400,12); i(245,6)the darted iron of(654,9). Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
astern, (362,6)forward(370,10)seemed striking on a ledg(510,6) sail
collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;
something roll(73,7)tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole
crew were half suffocated (876,6)y(29,6)tossed helter-skelter in(864,6)
white curdling cream(957,8)squall. Squall, whale,(610,6)arpoon had all
blended together;(212,6)he(53,8)merely grazed by(954,6)ron, escaped.

Though completely swamped(745,6)(790,9)nearly unharmed. Swimm(337,6)und
it we picked up the floating oars(197,6)la(661,6)them acros(636,6)gunwale,

The wind increased to a howl(761,6)waves dashed their bucklers(499,10)(234,6)hol(570,8) roared, forked(570,6)crackled around us(755,7) white

boat(534,7)at storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack(874,6)mist, grew
darker with(928,6)hado(222,6)night; no sign(961,9)hip could be seen.
The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out(889,9). The oars were
useless as propellers, performing now(615,6)ffice of life-preservers.
So, cutt(902,7)(914,9)(673,7)waterproof match keg, after many
failures Starbuck contriv(707,6)ignit(351,6)lamp(919,8)lantern; then
stretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the
standard-bearer(856,6)is forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up
that imbecile candle(171,8)heart(944,6)at almighty(97,8)ness(96,8)
(96,14)the(523,6)and symbol(681,6)man without faith, hopelessly

W(841,6)heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled

within a distance of not much more than its length.

Floating o(950,6)waves we saw the abandoned(587,6) as for one instant it

CHAPTER 49(869,6)Hyena.

There are certain queer tim(952,7)occasions in this strange mixed
affair we call life when a man takes(56,6)whole universe for a vast
practical joke, thoug(694,6)wit thereof he but (1006,6)discern(523,7)more
than suspects th(730,7)joke is at nobody’s expens(80,6)his own.
However, nothing dispirit(624,7)(23,8)seems worth while disputing. He
bolts down all events, all creed(703,7)belief(716,7)persu(361,6), all
hard things visible(873,6)n(14,7), never mind how knobby; as an ostrich
of potent digestion gobble(163,7)bullet(493,6)gun flints. And as for
small difficulti(539,7)worryings, pro(375,7)of sudden disaster, peril
of(542,6)and limb; all these(976,6)death itself, seem to him only sly,
good-natured h(411,9)jolly punche(682,7)e side bestowed by the unseen
and unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am
speaking of, comes over(758,7)only in (942,6)ime of extreme tribulation;
it(62,7)(180,7)very midst of his earnestness, so(728,6)what just before
might have seemed(315,8)a(581,6) most momentous, now(713,7)but a part
of the gener(910,7). There is(791,9)like the(472,6)s of whaling to
breed(1010,6)fre(693,6)easy(333,9)genial, desperado philosophy;(601,6)ith
it I now regard(84,8)whole voyage (176,7)Pequod(933,6)the great White
Whale its object.

“Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the
deck(966,6)I was still sh(532,6)myself in my jacket to fl(561,6)f the
water; (141,10) my fine friend, does(329,6)(648,8)(459,6)often
happen?” Without much emotion, though soaked through(563,6)like me, he
gave me to underst(325,6)at such(573,6)s did(119,6) (119,6).

“Mr. Stubb(327,11)turn(520,6)(680,7)orthy, who, buttoned up in his
oil-(289,6), was now calmly smoking his pipe(982,8)rain; (126,11) I
think I(768,6)heard you say(815,6)of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
mate, (217,6)arbuck, is by far the(839,6)careful and prudent. I suppose
then,(936,6)going plump on a flying(138,6) with your sail set in a foggy
squall is the heigh(202,6)(200,7)an’s discretion?”

“Certain. I’ve lowered for(252,6)s from a le(682,6)ship(116,6)gale off
Cape Horn.”(485,7)Flask(485,22)little King-Post, who(786,7)anding
close by; “you are experienced(470,7)se(618,7)(853,8)am not. Will you
tell me whether it is an unalterable law(551,6)is fishery(463,6)(195,6)
for an oarsman to break his own back pull(633,6)mself back-foremost into
death’s jaws(376,6)an’t you twist(833,7)maller?(799,7)Flask. “Yes(542,6)’(474,6)law. I
should(925,6)to see a boat’s crew backing water up to(524,8) face
(164,8). Ha, ha! the(619,8)ould give them squint for(11,7), mind
that!”

Here (713,6)from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement
of the entire case. Considering, therefore(818,7)(758,6)s and capsizings
(1021,7)(252,6)and consequent bivouacks o(38,6)deep, were matters of
common occurrence(555,9)kind of life; c(159,10)(965,6)at the
superlatively critical instant of(1006,7)on to(379,11)I must resign
my life in(37,7)hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow
who(152,6)at very moment is in his impetuousness up(284,7)point of
scuttl(229,6)e craft with(781,9)frantic stampings(283,18)
the particular disaster to our own(31,12)boat was chiefly to be
imputed to Starbuck’s driv(335,10)his(747,7)al(904,7) the teeth of a
(570,6),(542,9)(452,13)(89,8), notwithstanding, was famous for
his great heedfulness(111,8)fishery(549,19)I belonged to
this un(627,6)ly pruden(135,10)’s boat; and finally(633,13)in
what a devil’s chase I was implicated, touch(455,8)White Whale: taking
all things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make
a rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said I, “come along, you shall be
my lawyer, executor(437,6)legatee.”

It may seem strange(908,6)of all men sailors should be tink(952,6)(667,6)ir last wills and testaments, but there are no people(602,8)world
more fond of(878,6)diversion. This was(539,6)ourth time in my nautical
lif(191,7)I had done the same(412,6). After(908,6)eremony(811,6)oncluded
(963,10)resent occasion, I felt (490,6)e easier; a stone was rolled
away from my heart. Besides,(64,9)days I(345,8)now live w(360,8)as
good (250,7)days(870,6)Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a
supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks(109,8)case(683,6)
be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up(416,7)chest.
I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a
(199,6)conscience sitt(972,6)sid(497,6)bars of a snug family vault.

Now then,(918,10), un(83,6)ously rolling up(577,6)leeves(910,7)frock,
here goes for a cool, collected dive at(294,11)destruction(907,6)the
devil fetch the hindmost.


CHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.

“Who(573,7)have(221,9)it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if(810,7)but one leg
you(643,7)not catch (876,6)a boat, unless maybe to sto(295,6)plug-hole
with my timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”

“I don’t think it so strange,(742,7)all, on(998,6)account,” said(228,6).
“If his leg(656,6)off at(348,7)p, now, it(872,11) differen(124,6)g.
Tha(33,8)disable him; but he has one knee(458,6)good part of the other
left, you know.(230,12)know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”

Among whale-wise people it(150,6)ften been argued whether, considering
the paramount importance o(317,7)ife to(765,6)uccess(217,8)voyage, it
is right(769,7)whaling captain to jeopardize(435,6)life in the active
peril(94,9)chase. So Tamerlane’s soldier(223,8)(218,8)ith tears in
their eyes,(244,8)(551,6)invaluable(215,6)(227,7)(1018,6)to be carried
in(244,7)thickes(462,9)fight.

But(119,6)Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. C(378,10) that(799,6)two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
(461,11)(781,6)the pursuit of(545,6)s is always under great and
extraordinary difficulties;(862,6)every individual moment, indeed, then
comprises a peril;(106,7)these circumstanc(142,6)it wise(562,6)ny maimed
man to ente(586,8)e-boat(557,8)hunt? As a general(939,6), the
joint-own(548,6) the Pequod must have plainly th(507,6)not.

Ahab well kne(913,6) al(36,6) his friends at home would think(950,8)of
his(190,6)ing a (187,8)certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
(770,9), for(894,6)ake of being nea(23,7)cene of ac(638,6)nd giving
his orders in person, ye(935,6)C(925,7)(705,6)o(283,6)(177,7)actually
apportioned to him as a regular headsman(414,12)—above all for
(104,16)be suppli(953,8)five extra men, as(943,6)same boat’s
crew, he(417,16)such(520,6)ous conceits never(581,6)ed(567,6)eads
(965,7)(544,20). Therefore he had not solicited(460,7)(140,7) from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on(930,6)head.
Nevertheless(114,8)taken private measur(1007,6)his own touching all that
matter. Until Cabaco’s published discovery,(584,7)ilors had(695,7)
foreseen it,(790,7)(426,9)re when, after(638,7)a(753,8)while out of
port, all hand(98,6)conclud(390,7)customary business of fitting the
whaleboats for service; when some time(141,7)this(704,6)was now and then
found bestirring himself(681,8)(310,6) of mak(125,6)ole-pins(662,6)his
own(203,7)for what was(290,7)t(717,7)o(895,6)the spar(691,6)s, and even

observed in him(165,6)particularly his(756,8)ude in having an(932,6)

carpenter’s chisel gouged(635,6)(1018,8)here and straightened it a
(34,7)there;(641,7)ese things, I say, had awakened much interest and
curiosity(304,8)time. But almost everybody supposed(287,6)this
(726,10) preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be(1021,6)a view to
the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he(205,6)lready revealed his
intention to hunt(451,6)mortal monster in person(225,6)such a(215,7)ition
did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any(685,8)crew
being assigned to(592,10).

Now,(520,9) subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
away(277,6)in a(740,6)r(49,7)s(41,10). Besides, now and then such
unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
nook(59,6)ash-holes of the earth to man(670,7)floa(939,6)utlaws of
(191,6)s;(161,8) ships themselves(933,7)pick up(440,6)queer castaway

Beelzebub himself might climb up(505,6)id(986,8)ep down into the cabin
to chat(556,10)captain(116,6)it would not create any unsubduable
excitement in the forecastle.

But be all this as it may, certain it is(1008,6)whil(777,6)(692,11)

of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it(620,7)have been even

indifferent air concerning(393,9). He was(929,6)a(662,6)ure as

CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.

Days, weeks passed(767,6)under easy sail(203,6)ivory Pequod had slowly
swept across four several cruising-grounds;(856,6)of(722,6)Azores; off
the Cape de Verdes; o(953,6)Plate (so called), being(72,9)mouth o(69,6)Rio de la Plata;(477,9)Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery
locality, southerly from St. Helena.

It was while gli(504,6)hrough(858,7)latter(87,6)s(245,7)ne serene and
moonlight night(816,7)all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;
and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made(701,6)seemed a(68,7)y
silence, not a solitude; on such(43,6)en(170,7)(58,10) je(266,6)seen
far in advance(862,8)white bubbles at the bow. Lit up(189,7) moon, it
looked celestial;(177,8)some plum(909,6) glittering god uprising from
the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For(173,7)s(135,6)light
nights, i(493,6)his wont to mou(9,6)the main-mast hea(830,7)stand a
look-out there,(1012,10)same precision as if it had been day. And yet,
though herds of whales were seen by(582,8)no(618,6)whaleman in a
hundred would venture a low(322,6)for them. You may think(178,6)what
emotions, then,(199,6)eamen behel(339,7)old Oriental perched aloft at
such unusual hours; his turban(938,9)(525,6)companions in(831,6)ky. But
when, after spending his uniform interval(378,6) for several successive(484,7) without u(592,8)a single sound; (111,12)(930,6)is(788,6)ce,
(120,6)earthly voice(563,6)eard announcing that(886,8), moon-lit jet,
every reclining mariner started to his feet(559,7)some winged spirit
had lighted in the rigging(664,6)haile(355,8)rtal crew. “There she
blows!” Ha(395,6)trump of judgment blow(512,6)y could not have quivered
more; yet still(45,6)felt no terror; rather pleasure(906,6)(747,7)(886,6)
a most unwonted hour,(88,6)o impr(457,6) was the cry(898,7)o deliriously
exciting,(388,6)almost (372,6)soul on board instinctively desire(971,6)(810,6).

Walk(463,6)e dec(805,7)quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab command(385,6)
t’gallant sails and royals to be set(438,6)(167,7)tunsail spread. The
best (998,7)the ship must take the helm. Then,(974,6)(618,6)mast-head
manned(977,6)piled-up craft rolled down befor(83,6)win(128,6) strange,
upheaving, lifting tendency of(586,6)affrail breeze fill(327,8)hollows
of so many(278,6), mad(200,6)buoyant, hov(934,6)deck to feel like air
beneath the feet; while(649,7)she rushed along,(845,7)two antagonistic
influences were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heave(800,6)
other to drive yawingly to(958,6)horizontal goal. And had you watched
Ahab’s face(702,6)night,(36,6)ould(892,6)(825,6)t(737,6)in him also two
different thing(212,7)warring. While his one live leg(380,6)lively
echoes(309,6)(762,9),(668,9)roke of his dead limb sounded(413,7)
coffin-tap. On life and d(433,7)is old man walked. But(218,7)(736,9)
so swiftly sped(1009,6)(37,7)from(984,7)eye,(535,7)rrows(738,6)eager
glances shot, yet(830,6)ilvery jet was no more seen(379,11). Every
sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.

This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten(433,6), when,(566,6)days
after, lo! a(190,7)ame silent hour, i(199,6)again announced:(17,7)it
was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once(285,6)it
disappeared(847,7)i(213,6)never been(731,6)so it served us(714,6) after
(726,7)till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted
into the clear moonl(815,6)or star(14,7)as(38,6)ase might be;(201,10)ing(311,7)for one whole day, or two days(13,6)hree; and
somehow seeming at(802,7)distinct repetition to be advancing still
further and (12,8)in our van,(807,6)solita(683,7)seemed for ever
alluring us on.

Nor wit(835,6)immemorial supers(142,7)of their race(852,6)in accordance
(66,9)preternaturalness, as(473,6)emed, which in many(705,6)s invested
the Pequod, were there wanting(739,6)(141,6) seamen who(870,7)that
whe(601,6)and wherever(712,9); at however remote time(428,6)in(28,8)
far apart latitudes and long(15,6),(1013,6)unnearable (944,6)was cast by
one self-same whal(523,6)(59,6)whale, Moby Dick. For a time,(249,6)
reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread(999,6)is flitting apparition, as
(887,6)(338,6)reacher(795,6)beckon(529,9) and on, in order(230,6)the
monster(786,7)turn round upon us(535,6)rend us at last in the(364,7)st
and most savage seas.

These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a
wondrous potency from(1004,6)ontras(575,6)erenity(579,8)weather, in
which, beneath all its blue bland(717,6)some thought(669,7)lurked a
devilish charm, as for day(573,6)days we voyaged along, through seas so
wearily, lonesomely mild(626,7)all space, in repugnance to our vengeful
errand,(890,7) vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.

But,(458,8), when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began
howling a(554,7)(549,7)we rose and fell(579,6)the (274,7)roubled seas
(246,6)re(787,6);(136,7)he ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed(166,7)
b(193,6)and gored the dark waves in her ma(485,7)till, like showers of
silver chips(240,6)foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this
desolate vacu(650,7)life went away, but gave pla(471,6)sights more
dismal than(443,7).

Clos(513,9)bows, strange forms(903,8)water darted hither and t(12,6)
(524,7)us; while thick in our rear(232,6)the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
every morning, perched o(72,6)stays, rows(906,7)se birds were seen; and
spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clu(671,10)hemp,
as(946,7) they d(784,6)our ship(979,6)drifting, uninhabited craft; a
thing appoint(601,6)(459,7)ion(725,6)ther(843,6)fit roosting-(453,6)for
their homeless selve(304,6) heaved a(11,9), still unrestingly(37,7)
the black sea, as if its vast tide(327,7)a conscience;(163,8) great
mundane soul(373,6)in anguish and remorse for(921,9) sin and suffering
it had bred.

Cape of Good Hope, do(373,6)call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called
of yore; for(485,6)allured by the perfidious silences that(784,7) had
attended us, we found our(375,6) launched into this t(142,6)ed(345,6)where
guilty beings transform(57,10)ose fowls(517,8)se fish, seemed
condemn(565,6)swim on everla(474,8)without any haven in store, or beat
(225,6)lack air(51,14)orizon. But calm, snow-white, and
unvarying;(601,7)directing its fountain of feathers(836,8)sky(53,7)
beckoning us on from(373,7),(44,6)olitary jet would at times be
descried.

Duri(474,6)(381,6)blackness of the elements, Ahab,(962,8)assuming(850,8) time the almost continual command(81,8)dre(498,6)and dangerous
deck, manifeste(805,7)loomiest reserv(832,7)more seldom tha(455,6)
addressed his mates. In tempestuous(259,7)like(547,6), after everything
above and aloft has been secured, nothing(135,6)can be done but
passively to await the issue(340,8)gale. Then Capta(975,7)crew become
practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg insert(836,8)its
accustomed hol(636,6)(58,6)one hand firmly grasping a shroud(488,6) for
hour(847,6)(10,6)(585,6)stand gazing dead to windward, while an
occasional squall of sleet or snow(666,8)ll but congeal his very
eyelashes together. Meantim(744,7)crew drive(773,7)the forward part of
the ship by the perilous seas (976,6)urstingly broke over its bows,
stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist(678,6)the better to
guard agains(531,6)leaping waves, each man had slipped himself(474,6)a
sort of bowline(659,8) to the rail, in which he swung as(188,7)oosened
belt. Few or no words were spoken(194,10)silent ship, as if manned by
painted sailors in wax, day(857,7)day tore on through all(91,6)wift
madnes(616,6)gl(13,7)(809,7)demoniac(292,6). By nigh(851,6)same muteness
of humanity before(191,6)hriek(81,9)ocean prevailed; still in(232,6)ce
the men(314,7)(470,7)(368,7)s(48,8)wordless(812,6)(542,6)up(391,7)

seek(669,6)(30,7)in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forge(607,6)old
man’s aspect,(140,6)one(324,7)going down(607,6)the cabin to mark how(209,6)arometer(235,6), he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight(185,7)

CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.

South-eastward(694,9) Cape, of(789,6)distant Crozetts, a good cruising
ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead(572,6)Goney ((143,9))
by name. As she(853,10)ew nigh,(855,6)my lofty perch(428,7)
fore-mast-(99,6)I had(169,8)view(995,6)at sight so remarkable to a tyro
i(921,6)far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent(846,7)ome.

As i(721,6)waves had(912,6)fullers, this craft was bleached like the
skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her side(84,8)spectral
appearance(933,6)raced(612,6)long channels of reddened rust(744,8)all
her spars and her rigging were(174,9) thick branches of trees furred
over(735,6)hoar-frost. Only her lower sails(88,6)set. A wild(434,7)it
was to see(53,7)ng-bearded look-out(958,7)ose three (533,9)s. They
seemed clad(856,6)e skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment
that had survived nearly four years of(804,9). Stand(972,7)iron hoops
nailed to th(173,6), they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and
though, whe(209,7)hip(833,8)glided close under our stern, we six men(764,8)air came so nigh to each other(837,6)we might almost have leaped
from(205,9)(378,6) of on(151,7)to(416,7)o(801,6)other; yet,(441,6)
forlorn-looking(900,7)men, mildly eyeing us as(303,6)passed, said not
one word to our own(549,10)(738,8)the quarter-deck hail(912,6)eing
heard(985,6)below.

“Ship ahoy! Have ye se(376,7)White Whale?”

But(161,7)(960,6)ge captain, leani(471,8)the pallid bulwarks, was in
the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell(187,6)his
hand in(616,7)(570,8) the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to
make himself (286,6)without it. Meantime his(645,6)was still increasing
the distance between. Whil(116,7)rious silent way(324,7)eamen(568,7)
Pequod were evincing their observanc(613,7)is ominous incident at the
first mere mentio(96,8)(460,12)’s name to an(775,6)ship, Ahab for
a moment paused; i(796,9)seemed(681,6)ough he would(822,7)owered a
boat to boar(410,6)(565,7)r, had not the threatening(444,6)forbade. But
taking advantage of his windward positio(482,6)again seized(599,12),
and knowing by her aspect th(316,6)(159,9) vesse(824,6)a Nantucketer
and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is(486,11),(62,7)rou(693,8)orld! Tell them to address all future letters
(760,7)Pacific ocean!(770,7)is tim(344,6)e years, if I am not at(183,6)
t(110,20)(126,8)——”

A(287,7)(526,7)the two wakes(683,6)fairly crossed, (920,6)stantly, then,
in accordance with(730,7)singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,
that for some days before had been placidly swimm(493,7)our side,
darted away(135,6)wha(723,9)shuddering fins(204,6)ranged themselves
fore and aft(204,9)(732,9)’s flanks. T(800,6)in the cours(703,8)
continual voyagings(894,6)must often(220,10)ve noticed a similar
sight, yet,(969,6)y monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously
carry meanings.

“Swim(287,6)from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over in(657,7)water.
There(343,8)but little(267,8)words, bu(594,7)one conveyed more of
deep helpless sadn(670,6)a(335,6)insane old man had ever(529,8)evinced.
But turning (822,7)steersman, who thus far(581,10)holding(472,6)hip in
the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion
voice,—“Up helm! K(223,6)r off round(283,8)ld!”

R(19,15) (340,6)is muc(597,7)at s(58,6)o inspire proud feelings;
but whereto does all(980,6)circumnavigation conduct? Only through
numberless perils(327,8)very point whence we started,(116,6) those that
we left behind secure, were(148,7)e time(979,8)us.

W(69,6)is(281,6) an end(141,6)lain(932,6)by sailing eastward we could for
ever reach new distance(995,7)discover sights(642,6)sweet and(986,8)
than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomo(892,6)n there(227,6)promise
(771,7)voyage. B(556,6)pursuit of(307,7)far mysteries we dream of, or in
tormented chase(58,6)at demon phantom that, som(348,7)or other, swims
(814,7)all human hearts; while chasing such(1002,6)this(687,7)globe, they
either lead us on in barren maz(300,6)midway leave us whelmed.


CHAPTER 53. The Gam.

The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board(321,6)e whaler we had
spoken was this:(874,6)ind(480,6)ea betokened storms(409,6)even had this
not be(470,6) case, he woul(135,6)after all, perhaps, have(154,6)ed
her—judging by his subsequent(894,8) on similar occasions—if so it had
(133,7)at, by the process of h(777,6), he had obtained a negative answer
(968,7)question he put. For, as i(258,6)tually turned out, he cared not
to consort,(306,6)for five minutes, with any(844,8)r captain, except he
(943,6)contribute(695,6)(728,8)informa(169,8)so absorbingly sought. But
all(679,6)might remain inadequately estimated,(925,6)not something said
her(853,7)e peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each(872,6)
in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.

If two(310,9)s crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
eq(449,6)desolate Salisbury Pl(283,6) England; if cas(498,6)encountering
(212,10) in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, f(130,6) life of
them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation;(923,6)topping for a moment
to interchange the news; and(892,11)sitting dow(660,6)a while and
resting in concert: then, how much more natural(644,6)upon the
illim(249,7)(390,13)and(351,16)s(582,8)sea, two(572,8)
(572,8)descry(569,14) at the end(65,9)earth—off lone
Fanning’s Island(497,8) far away K(31,6)Mills;(217,22),
I say,(225,7)nder(477,6)circumstances(471,7)ships should not only
(396,12)hails, but come into still closer,(343,6)friendly and
sociable contact. A(805,14)would(980,6)seem to be a matter of
course, in the case of (926,8)owned in one seaport(907,6)whose
captains, officer(937,7)not a few(452,8)men are personally known to(802,11)(701,6)consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to
talk about.

F(835,8)ong absent ship, the outward-bounder(765,11)has letters on
board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her(174,6)some papers of a
date a year or two later tha(377,6)last one on her blurred and
thumb-worn files(487,6)in retur(931,6)that courtesy(228,19)
ship(528,7)receiv(1024,6)latest(858,8) intelligence from the
cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a(403,6)(958,8)utmost
importance to her(198,9)degree, all(683,6)will hold true concerning
(167,8)(671,8)cross(1024,14)’s track o(722,7)(188,14)
itself, even though they are equally(565,13)from home. For(420,6)f
them may(671,6)(338,7)d a transfer of(584,9)from(533,6)third(803,8)w
far remote(882,7)(769,6)some(825,6)ose(654,9)(361,7)(494,6)e peopl(140,8) ship she now meets. Besides,(224,6)(508,6)exchang(509,6)(502,8)news,
and(877,7)n agreeable chat(250,6)not onl(74,8)they meet with(446,7)e
sympathies of sailors, but likewise(49,13) peculiar
congenialities arising(646,6)a common pursuit and mut(431,6)shared
privations and perils.

Nor(762,7)difference of country make any very essential(46,11);
that is, so(542,7)s both parties speak one language, as is(646,6)ase
with America(164,7)English. Though, to be sure,(896,9) small number
of(54,8) whalers, such meetings do not(206,6)often occur(631,6)when
they do(24,6) there is too apt(133,7)a sort of shyness between them;
for your(197,8)man is rather reserve(749,7)your Yankee, he does not
fancy that(110,9)thing in anybody but himself(725,14)(319,8)
(265,7) sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the
(410,8)(343,8); regarding the long, lean Nantucketer,(767,6)his
nondescript provincialisms, as(336,12)ea-peasant. But where this
(155,12)in(230,12)(495,6)men(318,6)really consist, it(995,7)be
hard to say, see(195,6)at the(391,7)s in one day, collectively, kill
more(610,6)s than(945,9)(692,7)(53,16)in ten years(214,6)this
is a harmless little foible(224,21)-hunters, which the
(367,11)(570,9) take much to heart; probably, because he knows(961,6)he has a few(133,7)s(603,9)

So, then, we see(664,6)of all ships separately sail(540,8)sea, the(650,9)have most reason(985,8)ociable—and they are so. Whereas, some
merchant(118,7)crossing each other’s wak(324,9)mid-Atlantic, will
often(782,6)pass on without so(314,6)(662,6)ingle word of recognition,
mutu(615,6)utt(129,14) o(670,6)high seas, like a brace of dandies
in Broadway; and(587,9)time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism
upon(258,14)rig. As for Men-of-War, when(351,6)chance to meet at
(427,8)y first go through such a string of silly bowings and
scrapings,(46,8)duck(47,7)ensigns,(876,9)re(688,10)seem(518,6)
much right-down(702,6)y good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As
touching Slave-(674,6)meeting, why(233,7)are in(223,8)prodigious hurry,
they run away from(488,12)as soon as possible. And a(377,6)Pirates,
(374,20)cross(695,14)cross-bones, the(392,7)hail
is—“How many skulls?”—the same way(916,6)(871,10)il(50,10)
barrels?” And(958,6)question once answered, p(182,6) straightway steer
apart, for(318,12)fernal villains on both sides, and don’t(773,6)to
see overmuch of(955,14)villanous likenesses.

But look (575,6) godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
free-and-easy(298,7)! What(653,6)the(320,7) do(811,6)she meets another
(33,7)in any sort of decent weather? She has a “_Gam_,” a thing so
utterly unknown to all(598,7)(685,6)(809,8)y never heard of the name
even; and if b(977,10)hey should hear of it(985,7)only grin at it,
and repeat gamesome stuff(855,7)“spouters” and “blubber-boilers,”(1020,6)uch(479,6)pretty exclamations. Why it i(214,7)all Merchant-seamen, and
als(265,6)(825,7) and Man-of-War’s (43,8)(984,11) sailors, cherish(142,6)a scornful feeling towards Whal(60,6)s; this is a(784,10)it
would be hard to(799,7). Because, in the case of(821,8), say, I(385,7)
(755,7) know whether(936,6)profession(469,7)irs(562,6)ny peculiar glory
(395,6)it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but(501,6)at

But what(506,6)_Gam?_ You might wear out your index-finger running up

Certainly, it needs a defini(667,6)and(799,7) be incorpor(625,7)to the
Lexicon. With(817,6)view, let me learnedly(90,6)e it.

There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten
here. All professions have their own(91,8)peculiaritie(774,6)etail; so

CHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho’s Story.

(_As told at the Golden Inn._)

The Cape of Good Hope(797,6)all(726,6)atery region round about(399,6), is
much(161,6)some noted four corners of a great highway(371,8)you meet
more travellers than in any other part.

It was not(571,7)ong after speaking(236,7)ney that another
homeward-bound whaleman, t(319,10),* was encountered. She was manned
almost wholly by Polynesians. In(930,6)hort gam(131,6)ensued she gave us
strong news of Moby Dick. To(330,6)the (881,7) interest i(96,6)White

“‘(39,7)!—(21,7)! Pray, what is(73,10)(990,6)where is (68,7)?’
said Don Sebastian, rising in(694,6)winging mat of grass.

“On the eastern sho(686,6)our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your

though an(108,7)er, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born(1013,6)(21,10)
nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner(305,7). And for Radney(132,9)in his infancy he ma(246,7)laid him down on the lone Nantucket
beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; (107,10)after life he had long
followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was
he quite as veng(560,6)n(439,6) of social quarrel as(665,6)ackwoods
seaman, fresh from(243,6)atitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet
was this(296,10)er a man(552,6)some good-hearted traits; (813,6)is

had proved so(105,6)far; but(724,7) was doomed and made mad, and(136,10)—but(910,12) you shall hear.

“I(901,6)not more than a day or two at the furthest(729,7)pointing her
prow for her island haven,(372,6)the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again
increasing, but(442,6)so as to require an hour or(171,6)(153,7)pumps
every day. You must know(501,6)in a settl(305,7)civilized ocean like our

whole way across it;(718,8)of a still, sleepy night, should the
officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in(729,6)respect, the
probability would be(768,6)he and his shipmates(35,7)never(403,7)remember it, on account of all hands(602,6)y subsiding to the bottom.
Nor(159,6)e solitary and savage seas far from you(64,8)westward,

several of(200,6)ompany; especially by Radney the mate. He comman(383,7)

the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.
He did not lov(168,11)(984,6)(413,10)knew it.

“Espying (131,8) drawing near as he was toiling at the pump(456,6)the
rest, the Lakeman affecte(141,6)to notice(345,6)but unawed, went on with
his gay banterings.

“‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,

“‘Damn your eyes! what’s that(978,6)stopping for?’ roared Radney,
pretending(983,8)have hear(530,6)sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’(978,14)sir,’ said Steelkilt,(997,7)as a cricket. ‘Lively(773,7)

utmost energies.

“Qui(826,6)(209,9)at last,(237,8)(590,14)band, the Lakeman went
forward all panting(994,6)sat himself down on(985,6)indlass; his face
fiery red, his eyes bloodsho(291,7)wip(172,9)rofuse sweat from his
brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen,(665,7)ossess(648,9)
to meddle(946,6)such a man in(716,6)corporeally exasperated (984,9)know

stood betwee(798,6)two men.

“But(503,7)was more than this: the order abo(42,6) shovel was al(422,6)s
plainly meant to sting and insult(430,10), as though Radney had spat
in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will

fully comprehended wh(310,7)mate uttered(438,8)mand(913,6)as he sat

Lakeman paused o(825,6)hatches and thus spoke to the officer:

“‘Mr.(722,7), I will not obey you. Take(473,7)(744,6)away, or look to
yourself.’ Bu(813,6)predestin(382,7)te coming(961,6) clos(282,6)(935,6)here

the lower jaw o(1024,6)mate was stove in(816,6)ead; he fell(804,13)
spouting blood like a whale.

harbours, but never he(688,7)your(115,11) Pardon: who and what a(972,6)y?’(147,13), Don, a(338,7)boatmen belonging to our grand Erie(221,6).

“‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts(903,6)is dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary

most thriving villages(61,10)long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and

there howl(921,6)pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;
under the long-flung shadow, a(57,6) snug patronising lee of churches.
For by some curious fatality, as it is(237,7)noted of(224,6)metropolitan
freebooters that they(199,6)encamp arou(151,7)halls of justice, so
sinner(949,14)most abound in (698,6)t vicinities.

“‘I(115,7)a friar passing?’ said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the
crowded plazza, with humorous concern.

“‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in
Lima,’ laughe(162,6)Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’

“‘A moment! Pardon!’ cried another(831,6)e company. ‘In the name of all
us Limeese, I but desire to express(609,7), sir sailor,(466,6)we have by
no means overlooked(756,6)delicacy in not substituting present Lima for
distant Venice in(825,6)(870,8)comparison. Oh! do not bow and look
surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast—“C(968,8)s Lima.”

“Freely depicte(915,6)is own vocation(959,13)the Canaller would
make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is
he. Like Mark Antony, for days and(9,7)long his green-turfed, flowery
Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked
Cleopatra, ripeni(109,7)apricot thigh upo(905,6)sunny deck. But ashore,
all(669,6)effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which(352,13)
so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his
grand features. A terror to(194,6)miling innocence(651,8)villages
through(160,7)he(335,7)(139,7)wart visage and bold swagger are not
unshunn(607,6)cities. Once a vagabond o(634,10)canal,(822,8)received
good turns from on(174,8)s(661,10)s; I thank him heartily;(685,7)fain be not ungrateful; but it is often(92,11) prime redeeming
qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm
to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In
sum(928,13)what the wildness(464,6)is(341,6) life is, is
emphatically evinced by this;(196,6)our wild whale-fishery contains so
many of its most finished graduates, and(277,6)scarce any race of
mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrust(165,6)our whaling
captains. Nor does it at all diminis(859,6)curious(281,13)matter,

recklessly ploughing(533,6)ater(531,7)e(430,6)barbaric seas.

“‘I see! (7,6)’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha
up(975,7)silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one Lima. I
had thought, now(857,10)your temperate Nort(481,6)generations were

were lowered(977,6)mate’s go(80,6)start; and none howled more fiercely
with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a
stiff pull, their (842,10) got fast, and, spear in hand,(328,7)
sprang to(434,8). He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.
And now his banda(855,6)y was, to beach him o(712,6)whale’s topmost back.
Nothing loath,(79,6)(580,7)hauled him up and up, through a blinding
foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudd(536,7)boat

and went down.

“Meantime, at the first tap(347,8)boat’s bottom, the Lake(743,6)d

war-canoe(783,8)(238,6)s(326,6)setting sail for(537,6)other harbor.

CHAPTER 55. O(850,6)Monstrous Pictures of Whales.

I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
something lik(155,6)true form(982,8)whale as he actually appears (517,6)
eye(47,13)man when in his own absolute body(90,11)is moored
alongsid(292,6)whale-ship so(575,6)h(198,6)be fairly stepped upon there.
I(959,6)be worth while,(30,6)fore, previously to advert(202,6)ose curious
imaginary portraits of him which even down(262,7) present day
confidently challeng(508,6)fai(508,6)the landsman. It is time to set the
world right i(661,7)matter, by proving such p(547,11)(441,11)ll
wrong.
(283,11)that(180,7)imal source of all(265,7)pictorial delusions will
be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptia(972,7)Grecian sculptures. For
ever(789,9)ose inventive but unscrupulou(281,6)s(596,6)(491,6) marble
panelling(248,6)emples,(400,6)edestals of statues(146,6)on shields,
medallions, cup(34,7)coin(71,7)dolphin was drawn in scales of
chain-armor(838,6)Saladin’(108,7)a helmeted head(36,7)t. George’s; ever
(265,8)en has (923,10)(904,7)same sort of license prevailed, not
only in most popular(536,22), but in many scientific
(709,7)ation(753,8).

Now, by all odd(354,7)most ancient extant(814,9) anyways purporting
to(637,6)(1020,7)’s, is (22,6)(595,6)i(477,6)famous cavern-pagoda of
Elephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain(739,6)(79,7)almost endless
(649,10)(904,6)at immem(750,6)(110,6),(778,7)e trades and pursuits,
every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of
them actually came into being. No wonder then,(212,9)so(524,9)ur
noble profess(129,7)whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The
(957,6)(543,6) referred to, occurs in a separate department(601,9)all,
depicting the incarn(280,9)Vishnu(486,9)orm of leviathan, learnedly
known as the Matse Avatar. But though this (464,9) is half man and
hal(268,6)e, so as only to giv(650,6)tail(868,8)latter, yet(576,6)small
sec(473,8)him is all wrong. It looks more(990,6)(87,6)pering(96,9)an
anaconda, tha(745,6)broad palm(928,9)tru(800,9) majestic flukes.

But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian
painter’s(937,10)of(327,6)fish; for he succeeds no better(181,9)
antediluvian (567,6). It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing
Andromeda from the sea-monster or(644,6). Where did(87,6) get the model
of such a strange creature(566,6)at? Nor does Hogarth, in pain(673,8)
same scene in his own “(181,8)Descending,” make out one whit(282,7).
The huge corpulence(790,6)at(123,8)ian (227,8)undulates o(338,6)surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on
its back(522,6)its distended tusked mouth into which(647,6)illows are
rolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading(460,10)Thames
by(176,6)(107,6)the Tower. Then, there ar(901,6)Prodromus(941,6)s of old
Scotch Sibbald(736,6)Jonah’(42,7), as depicted i(853,6)print(68,9)Bibles and the cu(27,9) primers. What shall be said(910,7)se? As for
the book-binder(130,8) winding(1019,6)a vine-stalk rou(117,7)stock of a
d(594,9) anchor—as stamped and gilded(538,7) back(189,7)itle-pages of
many books both ol(63,6)new—that is a very(909,8)sque but purely
fabulous(824,9), imitated, I take it,(934,10)like figures on
antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless
call this(352,15)fish an attempt at a(545,6); because it was so
in(745,7)whe(520,6)device was first introduced. I(57,6)(19,10) by an
old Italian publisher somew(691,6)bout the 15th century, during the
Revival of Learning;(913,6)n those days(932,6)even down to a
comparatively late period,(318,8)s were popularly supposed to be a
speci(836,6)the Leviathan.

I(801,6)vignett(790,7)other embellishme(829,7)some ancient(618,7)you
will at times meet with(619,6)curious touches a(299,6)(940,7)(322,7)ll
manner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot spring(952,6)cold, Saratoga and
Baden-Baden, come bubbling up(691,6)his unexhausted brain. (260,6)
(847,10)(297,8)original edition(321,8)“Advancement(468,12)”(271,10)find(304,6)(257,8)whales.

But quitting (745,6)ese unprofessional(739,8)s, let us glance(320,6)ose
(964,8) of l(466,8) purporting(510,7)sober, scientific delineations,
by(642,7)who know. In old Harris’s collec(257,8)voyages t(765,6)re some
plat(611,6)(233,6) extracted(380,6)a Dutch book(71,11), A.D. 1671,
entitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen(824,6)e ship Jonas(18,7)
W(600,6)Peter(6,6)s(440,6)Friesland, master.” In on(494,7)ose (196,7)the
(430,6), like great raf(775,6)logs, are represented lying among
ice-isles,(778,6)white bears running over their living backs. In another(341,6), the prodigious blunder is made of(137,10)ing(864,10) with
perpendicular flukes.

Then again,(460,7)is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain
Colnett, a Post(24,8)(411,8)English navy, (474,12)(466,7)round
Cape Horn into the South Seas, for(254,6)urpose of extend(232,7)
Spermaceti Whale Fisheries(480,6)this(628,6)(222,6)outlin(81,7)(808,8)

one killed o(671,6)coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoist(50,6)deck.”
I doubt not(69,6)(344,7)had(206,6)veracious p(177,7)taken(300,8)
benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say
that it has an eye which applied, accor(393,6)(441,6)accompanying(281,6),
to a full grown sperm(326,8)would make the ey(908,7)at(704,7)a
bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant(301,8), why did ye not
give us Jonah looking out(113,9)eye!

Nor ar(143,6)most conscientious compilations of Natural History(387,20)the young and tender, fre(566,6) the same heinousness of
mistake. Look at(279,6)popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated(148,6)e.” In
the abridged London edition of 1807(1021,8)are plates of an alleged
“whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this
unsightly(472,7)looks much like an amputated sow; and, as(725,9)(119,8), one glimpse (675,6)is enough to amaze one,(585,6)in(131,6)nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon
any intelligent public of schoolboys.

Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great
n(602,6)ist,(101,6)shed a (653,7)fic systemized(814,7)book, wherein are
several pictur(475,6)the different speci(25,10)Leviathan. All these
are not only incorrec(479,9)e(94,8)(750,8)Mysticetus or Greenland
(979,6)((406,6)s to say, the Righ(1012,7)), even Scoresby, a long
experienced man as touching(962,6)(203,7), declares not to have its
counterpart in n(810,6)

B(201,8)lacing(951,8)cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
reserv(565,7)the(427,12)Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous
Baron. In 1836, he(509,13)N(533,6) History of Whales, in which he
gives what he calls a(422,16)Sperm(63,6). Before show(335,8)
(470,8)to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary
retreat from(64,10). In a word,(281,17)’s(153,12) is
not a(174,12)(632,6)a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of
a whaling voyage (such men seldom have)(726,6)whence he derived(275,13), who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his(941,12)predecessor
in(544,6)ame field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions;(417,6)is,(347,6)a Chinese drawing. And(513,6)sort of lively lads with the
pencil those(68,9)are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.

As(751,10)ign-painters’(973,6)s seen (241,8)treets hanging over the
shops of oil-dealers,(192,7)hall be said(921,7)m? They are generally
Richard III.(126,7),(235,6)dromedary humps, and very savage;
breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is(225,6)boats full of
mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue
paint.

But these manifold mistakes in depict(939,6)e(363,6) are not so very
surprising after all. Consider! Most(337,7)(681,12)(579,7)s have
been taken(966,6)(455,7)anded fish; and(171,7)are about as correct as a
(664,7) of a wrecked ship(418,7)broken back, would(64,8)ly represent
the noble animal itself in all its undashed prid(837,6)ull(704,6)pars.
Though elephant(233,6) stood(716,8)ir full-lengths, the living
Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The
(76,6)(804,6), in hi(582,7)majesty(881,6)ignificance, is only to be seen
at sea in unfathomable waters(410,6)afloat the vast bulk of him is out
of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship(496,6)ou(571,7)at element
it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily
into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.
And, not to speak(746,8)highly presu(302,6)difference of contour
between a young suck(435,9)(346,6)(548,6)grown Platonian (544,9);
yet, even in the case of one(890,6)ose(96,20)s(280,6)ed to a
ship’s deck, such is the(85,6)outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying
shap(785,6)im,(443,6)his precise expressio(171,6)devil(710,9)could not
catch.

But it may be fancied(87,7)from the naked skeleton(387,8)stranded
(767,7)accurate hints(83,8)derived touching his true form. Not at
all. For (639,6)(346,9)e more curious(661,6)s about this(424,10),
(268,9)(170,9)gives very little idea(824,6)s general shape. Though
Jeremy Bentham’(78,10), which hangs for candelabra(538,8)library of
(541,7)his executors, correctly conveys th(150,10)a burly-browed
utilitarian old gentleman, with all (175,6)’s other leading personal
characteristics; yet no(990,6)of(325,6)kind(541,7)be inferred(513,6)any
l(781,8)’s articulated bones. In fact, a(207,6)great Hunter says, the
mere(582,17)(905,6)bear(267,6)same relation to the fully
invested and padded animal(121,8)insect does(59,8)chrysalis(811,6)so
roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strik(45,7)vinced(491,7)
head, as in some part(338,9)book will(337,6)cidentally shown. It is
also(672,6)(738,7)ly display(106,9) side fin, the(372,6) of(654,6)
almost exactly answer(312,8)(44,9)the human hand, minus only the
thumb(257,7)fin has four regular bone-finger(461,6) index, middle, ring,
and(873,8)(45,6). But all these are permanently lodg(339,9)ir fleshy
covering(594,9)(188,6)(129,7) in an artificial (48,8). “However
reckless(226,6)(615,7)may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one
day, “he can never be truly(52,6)to handle us without mittens.”

For(255,11)reason(783,6)n, any way you may look at it,(20,6)ust needs
conclude(710,6)(869,10)L(922,8) (738,8)one creature(578,8)world
which(85,6)remain unpainted(873,8)last. True, one portrait may hit(968,6)ark much nearer than another, but non(308,6)hit it with any very
considerable degree of(708,6)ness. So there is no earthl(301,6)of finding
out precisely w(282,8)(492,6)reall(340,6)s like. And the(760,6)mode in(278,7)you can derive even a tol(166,7)idea of his living contour, is by
going a whaling yourself; but by so doing(476,6)run no small risk of
being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you
had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this
(594,9).


CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, a(360,7)True
(33,16)ing Scenes.

In connexion(549,6)the monstrous p(94,11)w(94,7)I am strongly
tempted here to enter upon those still mor(88,12)stori(181,6)them(795,7)a(67,6)be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass
that matter by.

I know of(694,6)four published outlin(201,9) great Sperm(398,6);
Colnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick(138,7)’(439,7)Beale’s. In the previous
chapter (79,7) and(197,7) have been referred to.(110,10) is far
better than theirs; but, by(185,7)odds,(132,8) is the best. All
(25,8)drawing(447,7)is(1010,7)are good, except(723,6)e middle figure in
the(602,8)(514,6)ree(607,7) in various attitudes, capping his second(273,8). His frontispiece, boats attacking(400,12)s, though no
doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is
admirably correc(666,6)life-like in its general effect. Som(255,7)e
(562,11)(350,10)in J. Ross Brown(354,6)prett(107,10)in contour;
but they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault(274,7).

O(710,6)Right(704,6),(515,9)(748,8)(442,8)s are in Scoresby; (128,8)
ar(199,6)n on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has
but o(115,10) of whaling scene(821,7)this is a sad deficiency,
because it is by such(194,10)only, when at all well done, that you
can derive anything like a truthful idea(461,7) living(789,8)s seen by
his(28,8)hunters.

But, taken for all in all, by far the finest(700,9)in(649,6)details
not(874,6)ost(645,8), presentations(316,8)es and(327,15) to be
anywhere found, are two large French(589,7)ings,(302,6)executed, and
(203,7)rom paintings by one Garnery. Respectively,(691,6)re(175,7)
(952,6)s on the(957,7)and(663,12). I(30,6)first(148,10) a nobl(849,14)is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath
the boat(207,6)the profundities(495,8)ocean(649,6)bearing hi(421,6)the

monster’s spine; and standing(177,6)at prow, for(771,6)one single
incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
incensed boi(974,6)pout(832,8)whale(210,7)(516,6)act of leaping, as if
from a precipice(305,6)action(76,10)ole (948,6)is wonderfully good(691,6)ru(60,7)half-emptied line-tub float(656,9)whitened sea;(176,6)ooden

of affright; whi(46,6)the black stormy distance(636,6)hip is(708,8)
down(570,9) scene. Serious fault(826,6) be found with(431,6)natomical
detail(812,7)is(476,8)but let(624,7)ass; since(631,8)e life of me, I
could not draw so(446,7) one.

I(165,7)econd engraving,(243,6)(822,7)(588,14)drawing alongside(1006,6)arnacled flank of a large running Right W(676,6)that rolls his
(350,6)weedy bulk(704,8)sea like some mossy rock-slide from the
Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full(1010,6)(463,6)(91,7)ot; so
that(83,6)so abou(990,6)a smok(521,9)chimney(952,6)would think there
must be a brave supper cooking(920,8)great bowels below. Sea fowls are
pecking a(698,6)small crabs, shell-fish(1005,6)other sea candies and
maccaroni, whic(610,6)(389,11) sometimes carries on his pestilent
back. And all(966,8)l(760,6)thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through
the deep, leaving ton(1010,6)umultuous white curds i(136,6)wake, and
caus(82,6)e sl(830,6)oat to roc(559,10)wells(562,6)a skiff caught ni(137,7)paddle-whee(863,6)an ocean steamer. Thus(771,6)foreground is all
raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the
glassy level(811,6)sea becalmed(894,6)drooping unstarched sai(180,6)the
powerless ship(727,6)the inert mas(222,6) dead w(887,6)a conquered
fortress, wit(542,6)flag of capture lazily hanging(879,9)(78,6)-pole
inserted into his spout-hole.

Who Garnery (382,6)inter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he
was either practically conversant(195,6)his subject, or else
marvellously tutored by some experience(291,7)man. The French are the
lads for(193,6)ing action. Go and gaze upon(810,9)(42,8)s of Europe,
and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing
(631,9) on canvas, as(768,6)at triumphal hall at Versailles;(121,7)the
beholder fights(878,7)y, pell-mell,(958,8) the consecutive great
battles of France(95,8)every sword seems a flash(696,7) Northern
Lights(697,10)successive armed kings and Emperors dash by,(996,7)
charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy(877,6)place(308,8)
(372,7),(492,8)se(910,6)attle-piec(231,6)(711,7).

The natural aptitude(222,8)(568,7)for seizing(760,6)icturesqueness of
things(292,7)to be peculiarly evinced in what(590,11)and engravings
they hav(130,8)ir whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s
(774,10)(585,6)e fish(276,6)nd not the thousandth part(464,6)a(8,7)e
Americans, (148,10)nevertheless furnished both nations(956,6)the only
fi(36,7)sketches at all capabl(492,6)onvey(348,8)real spiri(140,9)whale hunt. For the most part, the English and (187,8) whale
draughtsmen seem entirely content(179,6)present(483,8)mechanical
outlin(532,7)ings,(993,7)s the vacant profi(209,6)the(124,6); which, so
far as(571,19) effect is concerned, is about tantamount to
(327,6)(648,9)(116,10)a pyramid. Even Scoresby(287,6)justly renowned
Right(288,6)man, after giving us a stiff full leng(613,6)the Greenland(407,6)(1009,8)ree or four delicate miniatur(883,6)narwhales and
porpoises, treats us to a seri(933,6)classical(803,11) of boat hooks,
chopping knives(741,6)grapnels; and(659,10)microscopic diligenc(318,6)
Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection(361,6)shivering world ninety-six
fac-simil(242,6)magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement
(121,7)excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so
important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to(997,6)procured
for every(178,8) a sworn affidavit taken before a(541,10) Justice of
the Peace.

In addition(351,6)ose fine(482,12)from Garner(704,6)re are two other
French(534,12)worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself
“H. Durand.” O(993,8)em, though not precisely adapted to our present
purpose, nevertheless deserves men(570,6)n(187,6) accounts. It is a quiet
noon-scene amo(993,7)is(586,7)the Pacific; a (256,7)whaler anchored,
inshore, in a calm(928,6)lazily taking water on board; the loosened

both drooping together(42,9)reez(298,6)air. The effect is very fine,
when considere(971,7)reference to its(396,8)i(310,7)hardy fishermen

CHAPTER 57. Of(684,6)s in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in
Stone; in Mountains(39,6)tars.

On Tower-hill, as you go down(735,8)London docks, you may have seen a
crippled beggar (or _kedger_, as(970,6)ailors say) holding a painted
board before him, represen(654,9)tragic(810,7)in which he lost his
leg. There are(738,7)(814,7)and(755,7)boat(486,7)o(884,6)(570,6)ats
(presumed to conta(870,7)missing leg in all its original integrity) is
being crunched by the jaw(681,9)foremost(973,6). Any time these ten
years, they tell me, has that man held up(17,6)picture, and exhibited
that stump to an incredulous world. But(846,6)ime of his justification
has now come. His(349,15)re as good(368,9)s were ever
published in Wapping, at any rate(885,6)his(171,7)as unquestionable a
(26,9)any you will find (421,7)western clearings. But, though for
ever mounted on(332,6)stump, never a(302,6)-speech doe(705,6)poor(589,6)man
make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own
amputation.

Througho(396,7)Pacific(463,6)also in Nantucket(486,6)New Bedford(503,6)Sag
Harbor(938,6)will come across lively sketches of(800,11)
whaling-scenes, graven(703,8)fishermen themselves on Sperm
Whale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrought out(881,8)Right (55,6)bon(697,6)

jack-knives alon(876,6)(695,7)that almost omnipotent tool(424,8)sailor,
they(883,6)turn you out anything you please(306,8) way of a mariner’s
fancy.

Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man
to(962,6)condi(44,7) which God placed him, _i.e._ what is called
savagery. Your tru(603,7)-hunter is as much a (46,6) as an Iroquois. I
myself am(37,9), owning no allegiance but to the King(781,7)
Cannibals; and ready at any mom(404,6) rebel against him.

Now, on(640,8) peculiar characteristics(463,10)vage in his domestic
hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian
war-club or spear-paddl(526,6)its full multiplicity and(906,9)ion of
carving,(376,7)great a trophy of human perseveranc(399,6) Latin lexicon.
For(739,7)but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that
miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved(450,6)it has
cost steady years of(16,8)application.

As(949,9)(340,9)(587,9)so(29,10)whit(918,8)-(703,6). W(1008,7)
same marvellous(448,9), and(98,10)same single(254,16)of
his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you(346,11)one sculpture, not
quite as workmanlike,(401,6)s close packed(547,8)maziness of design, as
the Greek(860,9)Achilles’s shiel(374,7)full of barbaric spirit and
suggestiveness, as(816,6)rint(798,7)at fine old Dutch(112,10)lbert
Durer.

W(517,6)whales, or(11,7) cut in profile out(888,9)mall dark slabs of
the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met(721,6)in the
forecastles of America(149,7)rs. Some(1014,7)m are done(788,6)much
accuracy.

At som(249,6)gable-roofed country houses you(513,6)see brass(249,8)hung
by the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When(389,6)orter is
sleepy, the anvil-headed(364,6) would be best. But these(107,6)ing(404,7)
are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. O(131,6)spir(330,6)some
old-fashioned church(257,16)sheet-iro(522,8) placed there for
weather-cocks; b(176,6)y are so elevated(926,6)besides(649,6)are to all
intents and purposes so labelle(983,7)“_Hands off!_” you cannot examine
them(887,6)ly enough to decide upon their merit.

In bony, ribby region(812,7)e earth, where at the base of high broken
cliffs mass(683,6)rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings(145,9) plain,
(637,9)often discover images a(153,9)petrified form(176,8)
Leviathan par(850,6)rged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against(325,6)in a surf of green surges.

Then,(47,6), in mountainous(847,7)ies(310,7)the travell(767,6)continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; (380,6)n(627,9)rom

high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicle(32,6).

Nor when expandingly lift(689,6)your subject, can you fail to trace out
great(614,8)i(1007,6)starry heavens, and boats in pursuit(1003,7)m; as
when long filled with(239,7)t(711,6)ar the Eastern n(424,7)saw armies
locked in battle am(748,8)clouds. Thus at the North have I chased
Leviathan round and(10,7)the Pole(154,8)e revolu(558,13)bright

With a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for

see whethe(539,6)fabled(630,8)(579,6)all their countless tents really

CHAPTER 58. Brit.

Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in(729,6)vast meadows
of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon whic(638,6)Right Whale
largely feeds. For league(388,6)(12,8)it undulate(726,8)us, so that
we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of rip(423,6)golden
wheat.

On(634,6)econd day, numbers of(188,12)s were seen, who, secure from
the attack of a Sperm(245,6)r like(919,6)equod,(922,6)open jaws sluggishly
swam(200,9)(937,7)t,(334,6), adh(457,6)to(584,6)ringing fibr(701,6)(289,6)ondrous Venetian blind in(611,7)mouths, was(21,6)at manner separated

As morning mowers, who side by(8,6)slowly and seethingly advance(761,6)
scythes(256,13)long wet grass of marshy meads; even(537,6)ese

Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatur(643,6)the

CHAPTER 59. Squid.

Slowly wading throug(816,6)meadows of brit(638,6)Pequod still held on her
way north-eastward towar(343,7)island of Java; a(540,7) air impelling
her keel, so that(383,9)(421,7)ing serenity her three tall tapering
masts mildly waved(665,6)at languid breeze(930,7)ree mild palms on a
plain. An(237,7), at wide intervals(539,9)ilvery nigh(295,7)lonely,
alluring jet would be seen.

But one transparent blue morning, when a(366,6)ness almost pr(942,6)tural
spread ov(842,6) sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when
(182,7)g burnished sun-glade o(772,6)waters seemed a golden finger laid
across them, enjoining some secrecy(113,6)(1001,6)lippered waves whispered
togethe(950,7)ey softly ran on;(918,6)is profound hush(832,8)visible
sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo(839,8)e main-mast-head.

I(642,6)distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
(11,6)(30,6)disentangling itsel(969,9)e azure, at last gleamed before
our prow like a snow-slide, new slid(206,10)hills. Thus glistening
for a moment, as slowly it subsided(200,6)sank. Then once more arose,
and silently(166,8). It(545,8)not a whale; and yet is(441,6)Moby Dick?
thought(394,7). Aga(1014,7)phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
more,(740,7) stiletto-like cry(1022,6)startled every man(504,6)his nod,
the negro yelled out—“There! t(590,6)gain(13,8)she breaches! right
ahead! The White Whale, t(17,14)!”

Upo(712,6)(30,6)seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
bees rush(52,8)boughs. Bare-headed(818,6)e sultry sun, Ahab stood on
(57,6)wsprit(709,6)with one hand p(151,6)far behind in readiness to wave
his orders(194,8)helmsman, cast his eager glance(154,8)direction
indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of(575,8)

Whether the flitting attendance of(79,6)ne still(745,6)olitary jet had
gradually worked upon Ahab, so(592,6)he was now prepar(439,6)connect the
ideas of mildness and repose(686,6)the first sight(159,8)particular
whale he pursued; however(843,6)was, or w(248,7)(353,9)ness betrayed
him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly
perceive the white mass, than(892,8)quick intensity he instantly gave
(543,7)for lowering.

The four boats were soon o(698,6)water; Ahab’s in advance(684,6)all
swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down(747,7)hile, with
oars suspended, we(141,6)awaiting its reappear(130,6)lo!(865,9)ame spot
where it sank, once mo(19,7)lowly rose. Almost forge(686,6)for the
moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous
phenomenon(510,6)(166,6)ecret seas(509,6)hitherto reveal(713,6)mankind. A
vast pulpy(499,7)furlongs in length and breadth, of a(994,6)ing
cream-colour, lay floating(479,13), innumerable long arms
radi(46,6)from its centr(509,7)curling and twisting like a nest of
anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.
No perceptible face or front did i(846,6); no conceivable token of
either sensation or in(868,6); but undulated there(769,8)billows, an
unearthly, formless, chance-(249,6)ppari(96,6)f life.

As(933,8)low sucking sound(661,11)dis(732,6)ed again, Starbuck still
gazing(623,8)agitated(930,6)s (760,9)had sunk(856,6) a wild voice
exclaimed—“(767,7)rather had I seen(743,10) and fought him, than to
have(44,6)thee, thou white ghost!”

“What was it, Sir?” said Flask.

“The great live squid,(813,6), they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,
and return(827,6)their ports to tell of it.”

But Ahab(136,6)nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back(88,7) vessel;
the rest as silently following.

Whatever superstitions the sperm(207,6)men in general have connected
with(50,6)ight of thi(797,8), certain it is, that a glimpse(242,6)
be(615,6) very unusual(44,7)circumstance has gone far to invest i(901,6)
portentousness. So rarely is it(396,8)(133,6)though one and a(384,6)them

disgorge what are suppos(990,6)(564,7)detached arms(607,7) squid; some(547,9)thus exhibited exc(314,6) twenty and thirty feet in length. They

There seems some ground to imagine(236,10)great Kraken of Bishop
Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in
(316,9)(85,7) describes it, as altern(87,7)ising and sinking, with
som(282,7) particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But
much abatement is necessary(350,6)respect(1022,8)incredible bulk he

general by no means adds(714,8)rope’s durability or strength, however
much it may give it compactness and gloss.

Of late yea(373,7)Manilla(381,6)h(524,10)American(625,9)almost

so(217,6)le as(702,7)it is strong(550,8)far(590,6)soft and elastic; and
I will add (since there is an æsthetics in all things), is(514,6)more
handsome and becom(496,7)the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark
fellow, a sort of Indian(537,6)(358,8)is(296,6)golden-haired Circassian
to behold.

T(662,14)is(730,6)two-thirds of an inch(963,6)ickness. At first
sight, you(786,7)not think it so(366,7) as it really is. By experiment

twenty pounds; so that(894,7)ol(754,6)(465,6)bear a strain nearly equal
to three tons. In l(786,7)the common sperm(980,12)measures

bedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric (176,6)izations, without any
hollow bu(397,6)“heart(76,6)minute vertical tube formed (444,7)axis of

running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,
the utmost precaution is used in stowing(161,6)ine in its tub. Some
harpooneer(739,7)consume almost an(119,8)morning(895,7)s business,
carry(103,13)high aloft and then reeving it down(631,8)rough a
block t(655,11)tub,(557,7)(621,7)act(491,6)(335,6)to free it from all
possible wrinkles(129,6)wists.

I(694,6)English boats two tubs are(315,8)stead(986,7);(798,6)am(325,6)
being continuous(794,10)in both tubs. There is some advantage in
this; because these twin-tubs (97,6)so small they fit more readily into
(938,8), and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,
nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a
rather bulky freight for a craft whose plank(357,6)but one half-inch(276,7)ckness; for (219,6)ttom of the whale-boat is like cri(941,6)ice, which
will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a
concentrated one. Whe(976,6)painted canvas cover is clapped on the
(360,9)line-tub(383,6)boat looks as if it were pulling off with a
prodigious great wedding-cake to present to(291,10)s.

Both ends(317,8)line are exposed(725,6)lower end terminat(995,7)an
eye-splice or loop coming up(881,6)(419,11)against(810,6)ide(436,7)
tub(668,6)hanging (300,6)ts edge completely disengaged(974,6)everything.
This arrangement(213,9)(191,9)is necessary on two accounts. First:
In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional(320,6)from a
neighboring(894,7)in ca(970,6) stricken(688,6) should sound so deep as to
threaten to carry of(747,6)entir(437,7)originally attached(495,7)
harpoon. In these instance(1003,7)(131,6)of course is shifted(832,6)a mug
of ale, as(652,8),(481,10)on(691,7)(611,7)other; though(316,6)irst
boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This
(478,12)is indispensable for common safety’s sake; for(829,6)the
(718,10)(757,12)in any wa(320,17)(445,7)and(68,10)(437,6)th(406,6)ru(1010,6)(393,6)u(872,9)end almost in a single, smoking
minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop th(372,6)or the doomed(338,6)(42,6)infallibly be dragged down after him in(419,7)profundity of
the sea; and in that(686,6)no town-crier(148,7)ever find her(983,6).

Befor(880,7)ing(317,9)(179,9)chase(628,6)upp(390,20)s

rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to
(960,6)onnexion(884,6)(105,10) goes through sundry mystifications too
ted(81,7) detail.

Thus the whale-line fold(21,8)ol(1014,7)in its complicated coils,
twi(877,6)and writhing a(983,6)it in almost(873,7)direction. All the
oarsmen are involved(114,8)perilous contortions;(931,9)(810,7)timid
eye(767,8)landsma(300,6)y seem as Indian jugglers,(380,10)deadliest
snakes sportively(713,8)ing their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal
woman, fo(870,6)first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,
and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him(282,6)at any
unknown instan(49,6)(616,7) may be darted(921,6)a(402,6)se horrible

King Edward,(47,9)men compos(768,7) crew pull in(896,7)jaws of
death(854,7)a halter around(1022,7)neck, as you may say.

Perhaps a(507,6)little thought will now enable you to account(871,7)ose
repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of
this man o(667,9)n being taken out(402,8)boat by the line(841,6)lost.
For(423,9)(30,6) is darting out, to be s(183,6)then i(46,6)(484,6)is

Again: as the profound calm(754,7)only apparently precedes and
prophesies(730,8)storm, is p(927,7)more awful tha(726,6)storm itself;
for, indeed, the(127,6)is b(396,7)wrapper and envelope(113,13); and

CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.

If to Starbuck the(991,6)ition(967,8)Squid wa(614,10)of portents, to
Queequeg it was quite a different object.

“When you see him ’quid,” sai(868,6)savage, honing his(227,8)(524,7)
bow of(26,6)oisted (388,6)“t(94,8)quick(100,10)parm(671,6).”

The next day was exceedingly still and sultry(1021,6)with no(870,6)special
to engage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resis(998,6)spell of
sleep induced by such a vacant sea. For(926,6)par(939,7)e Indian Ocean
through(1023,7)we then were voyaging is not what(937,6)men call a lively
ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses(515,7)poises, dolphins,
flying-fish(676,6)other vivacious denizens of(782,6)stirring waters(788,6)
those of(643,6)Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore (186,6) off Peru.

I(651,6)my turn to stand a(385,6)foremast-head;(483,10)my shoulders
leaning again(442,8)lackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed
in(373,6)seemed an enchanted air. No resolution(563,7)with(177,6)it; in
that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of
my body; though (16,7)(758,7)continued to sway as a pendulum will,
long afte(389,6)power(635,7)first moved it is withdrawn.

Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed(657,6)the
seamen(453,8)main and mizzen-(465,9)s(764,6)already drowsy. So that
(289,8)all three of us lifelessly swung from(944,7)ars(721,6)for every
swing(813,6)we made there was a nod(65,6)below(76,11)lumbering
helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests(687,6)across the
wide trance o(818,6)sea, east(74,9)o west(917,6)the sun(367,6)all.

Suddenly bubbles(687,8)bursting benea(802,6)closed eyes; like vices my
hands grasp(191,6)(801,8); some invisible, gracious agency preserved
me;(910,6)a shock I(542,6)back to life. And lo!(142,6) under our lee, not
forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like
the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian
hue, glisten(106,11)sun’s rays(332,6)a mirror. But lazily undulating
(161,7)trough(496,13)and ever(544,6)non tranquilly spouting his
vapory jet,(238,6)(263,6)ooked(134,8)portly burgher smok(63,7) pipe of
a warm afternoon(179,6)that pipe, poor(93,6), was thy last. As if struck
by(542,6)enchanter’s wand(157,6)sleepy ship(227,9)y(22,6)er in it all
at once started into wakefulnes(824,7)more than a score of voices from
all parts(844,8)vessel, simultaneously(674,6)the three not(66,10)oft, shouted for(42,7)accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and
regular(443,8)(847,8)parkling brine(229,6)the air.

“Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab(831,6)obey(468,8)own order, he
dash(961,7)helm down bef(317,6)(21,6)sman could handl(26,6)spokes.

The sudden exclamation(342,9)crew must have alarm(228,7)whale; and
e(112,7)boats were down, majestically turning, he swam(256,7)o the
leeward, but(437,6)such a steady(804,10)ity(836,6)making so few ripples
as(95,8),(739,6)thinking(768,6) all he might not as yet b(221,9),
Ahab gave(363,6)s(812,6)not an oar should be used(979,6)no man(300,6)speak
but in whispers. So seat(957,8)Ontario Indians on(616,6)unwale(729,8)
boats, we swif(1005,6)t silently paddled along;(437,6)alm(220,6)dmitting of
the noiseless sails being set. Presentl(753,6)we thus glided in chase,
the monster perpendic(770,7)flitted his tail forty feet(770,13),
and then sank out of sight(283,6)a tower swallowed up.

“There go flukes!” w(926,7)(938,6)n announcement immediately fo(74,7)by
Stubb’s produc(860,8)match and ignit(883,8)pipe, for now a respite
was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the
whale rose again(732,6)(408,6)now in advance(915,8)smoker’s boat, and
much nearer to it than to any(971,8)others, Stubb counted up(631,6)
honor(1015,9)apture. It was obvious, now(856,9)e (189,6)had at length
become aware(255,8)pursuers. All(699,6)(208,6)cautiousness(459,8)refore
no longer of use. Paddles were dropp(892,8)oars came loudly(622,6)play.
And still puffing at(472,11)(270,7)heered on his crew (688,6)
assault.

Yes, a mighty chang(253,6)come ov(513,8)ish(233,6)alive to his jeopardy,
he was going “head out”;(344,6)part obliquely projecting from the mad
yeast which he brewed.*

*It will be seen in som(512,7) pla(587,6)what a very light substance the
entire(714,6)i(538,10)sperm(505,6)’s enormous head consists. Though
apparently(184,6)ost massive, it is by fa(826,6)most buoyan(263,7)about
him. So(631,6)with ease he elevates it in the air(835,6)invariably does
so when(375,7)(516,7)utmost speed. Besides, such is t(346,6)adth(894,7)

formation(980,8)low(86,7)(862,7)by(516,11)(231,6)ing(99,11)he
thereby may be said to transform himself(569,6)a bluff-bowed sluggish
galliot(818,6)a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.

“Start her, s(11,10)my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of
time—but(67,10);(78,10) like thunder-claps(280,6)’s all,” cried
Stubb, splutt(357,6)out(680,6)moke as he spoke. (185,12)now; give ’em
(387,6)ng(441,6)trong stroke, Tashtego. (248,11)Tash, my boy—start
her, all; but keep cool,(11,10)—cucumbers(604,8)word—easy,
easy—only(262,16)grim death and grinning devils(748,6)rais(950,6)buried dead perpendicular ou(690,8)ir graves, boys—(345,10)(228,7)

“Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old
war-whoop to(411,6)kies; as every oarsman(962,8)strained boat
involuntarily bounced forward wit(869,6)one tremendous leadi(453,9)
whi(909,7)eager Indian gave.

But his wild(225,7)s were answered by others quite a(46,6). “Kee-hee!
(9,8)” yelled Daggoo,(208,7)ing(182,8)s and back(14,6)on his seat,
like a pacing tig(349,6)his cage.

“Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a
mouthful of Grenadier’s steak. And thus(350,6)oar(177,6)yell(695,6)keels
c(874,8)ea. Meanwhile, Stubb ret(246,7)his place(481,8)van, still
encouraged his men(549,8)onset, all(810,6)hile puffing(993,11)from
his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and(16,6)(611,8), ti(97,6)
welcome cry was heard—“Stand up(1011,6)tego!—give it to him!” The harpoon
was hurled. “Stern all(37,7)oarsmen backed water;(788,6)ame moment

The boat now flew(517,9)the boiling(995,6)(379,6)a shark all fins.

business truly in(686,6)rocking commotion.

*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may(149,6)be
stated, that,(108,6)e old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the

From the vibrat(160,9)extending the entire leng(985,6)the upper part

would have thou(42,6)e craft had two keels—one clea(893,6)he(621,6), the

once. A continual cascade played (811,7)bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy
in her wake; and,(57,8)slightest (680,6)(309,6)within, even but of a
little fing(231,7)(433,10), cra(756,7)raft canted over her spasmodic
gunwale into(132,6)ea. Thus they rushed; each man(679,6)might and main
clinging to his seat, to prevent(496,7)tos(770,7)the foam; and the tall
form of Tashtego(280,9)teering oar crouching almost double, in order
to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics
seemed passed (561,6)y shot(554,6)eir way, till at(776,8)the whale
somewhat slackened his flight.

“Haul in—h(8,6)!” cried Stubb(292,8)bowsman!(550,6)facing round

The red tide now poured(934,6)all sides(122,8)monster like brooks down

bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind(385,7)ir wake. The s(422,8)sun

his long sharp(386,7)(246,9)fish(1010,6)kept it there, carefully
churning and(86,6)ing, as if cautiously seeking to feel(685,7)some gold

impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, s(148,7)the imperilled craft,
instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from

“He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.

“Yes; both pipes smok(425,6)!”(975,6)ithdrawing his own(432,6)(155,6)uth,
Stubb scattered(555,6)ead ashes over(534,6)ate(255,6), for a moment, stood
thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he(738,6)ade.


CHAPTER 62. The Dart.

A word concern(570,6) incident i(444,6)last chapter.

According (767,7)invariable usage(774,8)fishe(746,13)-boat pushes
off(722,6)the ship(663,7)the headsman or(58,7)killer as temporary
steersman, an(335,6)harpooneer(59,10)fastener pu(588,6)the foremost
oar(908,6)one known as(76,15)-oar. Now it needs a strong,
nervous arm to strike(257,7)rst iron(738,11)ish; for often, in what
is called a long dart(316,6)heavy implement has to be flu(392,9)
distanc(384,6)wenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting
the chase(126,7)(339,10)is expected to pull(749,6)ar meanwhile(143,8)uttermost; indeed, he(67,16)set an example of superhuman
activity(617,8)rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated
lou(226,6)intrepid exclamations;(957,6)hat it is to keep shouting at the
top of one’s compass, (241,6)all(578,6)ther muscles are strain(355,7)half
started—what that is n(636,8) but those who have tried it. For one, I
cannot bawl very heartily(208,6)ork(23,6)recklessly at one(810,9)same
time. In this(174,7)(326,6)awling stat(520,6)n(927,7)his back(630,8)fish, all(97,6)c(763,6)(591,7)ed(914,12)hear(859,6)exciting

crotch(130,6)with(532,6)little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it
somehow(1009,10)whale. No wonder, taking(29,7)ole fleet of(44,6)men
in a body,(548,6)out of fifty fair chances for a dar(794,7)five are
successful; n(125,8)(626,6)so many haples(269,9)eer(694,6)madly cursed

make(702,6)voyage(686,6)if you tak(761,6)breath(433,8)his body how can
you expect to find it there when most wanted!

Again, if the dart be (475,10)(922,6) at(979,6)econd critical instant,
that is,(99,6)(662,9) starts to run,(411,9)header an(958,12)

headsma(178,7)chief officer(653,7)(953,8)cr(147,6)akes his proper
station(656,10)ws(58,8)boat.

Now, I care not who maintain(544,6)contrary,(590,6)ll this is both
foolish and unnecessary. The (194,8) should stay(141,13)from
first to last; he(47,8)both(526,6)(681,11)(287,8) lanc(670,7)no

obvious to any fisherman. I know(887,7)his w(210,6)ometimes involve a
slight loss of speed(387,8)chase; but long experience in various
whalemen of more than one n(465,6)has convinced me(152,6)(487,7)vast

CHAPTER 63(720,6)Crotch.

O(70,6)the trunk(931,6)branches grow;(107,8)them(963,6)twigs. So, in
productive subjects, grow(553,8)pters.

The crotch alluded to on a pre(689,6)page deserves independent mention.
It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two(311,6)in length,
which is perpendicularly inserted in(372,6) starboard gunwale near the
bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest(37,9)wooden extrem(725,6)
(517,11), whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects(524,6)the
prow. Thereby(735,6)eapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who
snatches it up as readily(624,6)its(204,6)as a backwoodsman swings his
rifle(149,9) wall. (433,6)customary to hav(410,6)(852,7)s reposing in
t(553,9), respectively call(878,6) first and second irons.

But thes(96,14), each by its own cord, are both connected with
the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one
(376,11)fte(552,6)(476,6)(607,10)ame whale; so that if, in the
coming drag, one should draw out(944,6)(560,6)may still retain a hold. It
is a doubling(1010,8)chances. But it very often happens(144,6)owing to
the(588,8)aneous, violent, convulsive runn(103,11)whale upon
receiv(325,6)(451,8)iron, it becomes im(326,8)(861,9)(800,7)eer,
however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch(967,6)(549,10) into
him. Nevertheless, as(43,18)s already(545,15) the
line, an(658,6)line is(255,8), hence(467,6)(908,7)must, at all events,
be anticipat(990,6)tossed out(427,8)boat, somehow(758,6)omewhere; else
the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled(654,9)

(428,8) saddest and(296,6)fatal casualties.

Furthermore: you must know(454,7)hen(547,20)thrown

Nor, in general, is it (925,9)to secure it again until(1013,11)is

calm; so, form(891,6)tandem of three(716,6), we commence(385,6)slow

Darkness came on(107,8)ree lights up and down (466,7)(645,6)’s

dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly
eye(812,8)heaving(968,7)for a moment, he issu(882,7)usual orders for

Though, in overse(230,9)pursuit(753,6)is(238,6), Captain Ahab had
evinced his customary activity, to(723,8) so; yet now(979,6)the
creatur(879,6)dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or
despair,(1015,8)working in him;(674,7)the sigh(209,7)at dead body
reminded him(153,6)Moby Dick was yet to be slain;(428,7)ough a thousand
other(534,6)s were brought to his ship, all(254,6)woul(425,6)one jot
advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you(70,7)have(147,7)t

lin(181,6)e vast corpse itself, not(483,6)hip, is(432,7)moored. Tied by

reclines while the (721,6)remains standing.*

*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most

If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known
on deck, Stubb, h(430,6)ond mate, flush(540,8)conquest, betrayed an
unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was
he in(964,6)the staid Starbuck(154,6)official superior, quietly resigned
to him for(361,6)im(657,6)sole(618,12)of affairs. On(423,7), helping
cause of all(867,6)liveliness in(304,8)was soon(677,6)strangely
manifest.(345,6) was a high liver; he(61,7)mewhat intemperately fond of
(693,9) as a flavorish thing to his palate.

“A steak, a(9,8)ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut
me one from(530,6)mall!”

Here be it(576,6),(432,8)ough these wild fishermen do not,(192,6)general

About midnight(853,6)steak was cut(491,6)ooked; and ligh(116,7)two
lanterns of sperm oil,(717,7)stoutly stood up(647,8)spermaceti supper
(972,7)capstan-head, as if(1001,6)(25,7) were a sideboard. Nor was(872,6)
the only banqueter on(793,6)’s flesh(650,6)night. Mingl(486,7)ir
mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on(13,12)f sharks,
swarming rou(537,6) dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.

(858,7)you heard them) wallowing(218,7) sullen, black waters, and
turn(116,9)o(264,9)acks as they scooped out huge glob(841,6)ieces of
the(532,6)(782,9)igness of a human head. This(909,12)fea(909,8)
shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable
surface,(191,6)contrive to gouge ou(68,7)symmetrical mouthfuls, remains
a par(157,8) universal problem of all things. The mark(310,6)thus leave
(344,6)(820,6), may best be likened to(565,6)ollow made by a carpenter in
countersinking for a screw.

Though amid(149,7)e smoking horror and diabolis(189,6) sea-fight,(874,7)
will be seen long(850,6)gazing up(171,8)ship’s decks, like hungry dogs

But, as yet, Stubb heeded no(972,6)mumblings of the banquet that was
going on so nigh him, no(332,6)than(941,6)(849,6)(95,7)the sma(929,6)of
his own epicurean lips.

“Cook, cook!—where’s(124,6)old Fleece?” he c(788,6)t length, widening his
legs still further, as if to form a(509,6)secure base for his supper;
and, a(390,6)sam(643,7)dart(103,7) fork into(359,6)ish(103,8)stabbing
with his lance; “cook, you(230,7)sail this way(251,7)”

The old black, not in any very high glee at having been prev(853,6)
roused from (96,6)rm hammock at a(904,6)unseasonable hour, came
sha(525,6) along(72,10)galley, for, like many(174,10)s,(962,7)was

both hands folded before(988,6)and re(284,6)on(273,6)wo-legged cane, he
bowed his arched back(900,14) over(851,19)sideways
incli(965,8) head, so as to br(887,8)best ear(891,6)play.

“Cook,” said(240,6), rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
mouth, “don’t you think(926,6)steak is(67,8)overdone? You’ve been
beat(749,6)(51,9)too much(988,6); it’s too tender. Don’t I always say
that to be good, a whale-(134,6)must be tough? There are those sharks

“No(77,6); go o(948,6)on.”

“Well, den, Belubed f(557,15)”—

“Right!” exclaim(335,11)pprovingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,” and

mouthful(637,8)last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation(405,6)e

CHAPTER 65. The(267,6) as a Dish.

That mortal man should feed upo(709,6)creature(801,6)feeds his lamp, and,
like Stubb,(306,8) by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
outlandish a thing(914,6)one must needs go a little into the history and
philosophy of it.

It is(209,6)record,(1005,6)(741,6)centuries ag(79,6)tongue (861,7)Right

prices there. Also(136,7)in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook(144,7)
court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be
eaten(603,6)barbacued porpoises,(624,6), you remember, are a species of

meat is mad(471,7)(946,6)about the size of billiard(33,6)(361,6)being
well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-(101,6)or veal(115,6).
T(904,8)onks of Dunfermline were very fond(547,7)m. They ha(533,9)

The fact is(654,7)among(964,6)unters at least, the w(642,6)ould by all
hands be(348,12)a noble dish,(176,6)there not so much of him; but
when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men

old vintages of prim(536,6)train oil. Zogranda, one(928,7)ir(226,6)famous
doctors, recommends strips of blubber(947,7)fants, as(722,6) exceedingly
juicy and nourishing. And(865,6)reminds me(589,6)certain Englishmen, who
long ago(713,6)accidentally left in Greenlan(614,6) whaling vessel—that
these men actu(62,6)ived for several months on(502,7)uldy scraps of

the Dutch(799,6)men (157,6)(105,7)are called “fritters”;(118,6), indeed,
they(952,6)ly resemble,(390,7)brown and crisp(553,6)smelling something(703,6)old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.
They(645,6)such an eatable look(475,6)(836,9)self-denying stranger can
hardly keep his hands off.

But what further depreciates the(864,6) as a civilized dish, is his
(664,9) richness. He i(64,6)great prize ox(790,7) sea, too fat to be
delicately good. Look at(179,6)ump,(542,7)would be as fine eating as the

is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the
third(832,6) of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
butter. Nevertheless, many(813,10)have a method of absorbing it into
some other(97,6)ance(773,6)then partaking(171,6). I(1009,6)long try watches

tell a calf’s head from(55,10) heads;(261,6), indeed, requires
un(766,7)discrimination. And(251,6)is the reason why a(266,6) buck with

CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.

When(849,8)Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale(395,8)long and
weary toil, is brought alongside late at n(743,6)it is not, as a general

him in. For(838,6)(37,9)is an exceedingly laborious one;(152,7) very
soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefor(897,6)
common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a’lee(113,6)then send

two for an hour, each coupl(243,6) crew in rotation(83,7)mount the deck
to see(753,6)all goes well.

But sometimes, especially upo(827,6)Line(699,8)Pacific, this plan will
not answer (101,6); because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather

stretch, little more tha(893,6)skeleton would be visible by morning. In
most other par(177,6)the ocean, however, where these fish do not so
largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be (552,7)s considerably
diminished, by vigorously stirring them up(652,6)sharp whaling-spades, a
procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to
tickle(111,6)into still greater activity. But it wa(998,6)thus(578,7)

creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic(565,6)ity(233,8)to lurk in

It was a Saturday nigh(497,7)such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio

One(935,8)attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon

CHAPTER 68(730,6)B(794,6).

I have given no small attention t(917,7)not unvexed subjec(896,7)skin
of(705,10). (84,7)had controversies about it with experienced
wha(300,6)afloat(927,6)learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion
remains unchanged; b(112,6)is only an(45,8).

The question is, what(974,7)ere i(857,6)skin (225,12)? Already you
know(58,6)his(514,8) is. That(17,11) something(78,8)consistence
of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compac(308,6)
ranges from eight or te(457,6)welv(725,6)fifteen inches in thickness.

Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any
creature’s(316,6)as be(247,9)at sort of(256,12) and(131,10), yet
in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;
because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer(322,6)the(667,6)’s body(394,6)hat sam(1008,9);(190,7)e outermost(80,17)
(285,6) animal, if reasonably(132,6)(641,7)can(883,6)be(111,7)(869,6)?
True,(153,9) unmarred dead(159,6)(904,12), you may scrape off with
your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat
resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass,(886,6)(897,6)almost as
flexibl(650,6)soft as satin;(545,6)is, previous to(575,7)dried, when it
not(981,6)contracts(581,10)ens(822,6)becomes rather hard and brittle. I
have several(580,6)dried bits, which I use for marks in my(359,6)-books.
It is(317,12), as I said before(552,6)(780,6)laid upon the printed
page, I (148,6)ometimes pleased mysel(453,6) fancying it exerted a
magnif(24,6)nfluence. At any rate,(398,7)pleasant to read about(570,6)s
through their own spectacles, as(603,10)ay. B(57,6)t I am driving at
here is this. T(824,9)(628,17)(562,9)(626,12)which, I
admit, invests the entire(757,20)is not so much(574,6)
regarded a(63,6)skin(813,8)creature,(29,20)skin, so to
speak; for it were simply ridicul(686,7)say,(962,6)(475,6)oper(114,8)
the tremendous(938,6)(291,7)nner and more tender tha(547,6)(179,8)a
new-born child(383,6)no(54,6)of(365,6)

Assum(933,8)blubber(844,6)(258,17)whale; then(863,7)this(252,6)
as i(677,6)case of a very large Sperm W(380,6)will yield(118,6)ulk of one
hundred barrels of oil; an(979,10) is considered that, in quantity,
or(970,8)weight(360,7)oil, in its expressed st(752,6)s only three
fourths, and no(420,6)(590,7)(636,9)(539,9)oat; some idea may hence
be had(635,8)enormousness(655,6)at animated mass, a mere part of whose
mere integument(316,6)s such a lake of liqui(700,7)at. Reckoning ten
(338,8)to the ton, you have ten tons for the net(316,7)(410,6)(281,9)quarter(192,7)e stuff(860,13)’(531,6).

In life, the visible surfa(316,10)(537,11)(916,8)the least among
the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably(546,7)all over
obliquely crossed and re-(15,8)with numberless straight marks in
thick array, something like those(764,8)finest Italian line
engravings(900,6)these(92,7)do not seem(885,7)im(664,8)upon the
isinglass(634,11)above mentioned, bu(71,13)seen through it, as
if they were (150,6)(103,11) body itself. Nor is(993,6)all. In some
in(764,6)s,(586,8)quick, observant eye,(279,7)linear(329,6), as in a
veritabl(134,8)ing(193,6)afford the ground for far other delineations.
These are hieroglyphical;(1006,6)is, if you call(425,7)mysterious cyphers
(256,7)walls of pyramids(87,13)s, then(91,8) the proper word to
u(520,10)(671,7) connexion. By my retentive memory(839,7)
(107,13)(507,6)on(798,15)n particular, I was much struck
with a plate re(803,7)ing the old Indian characters chiselled (621,7)famou(251,14) palisades(37,7) banks(1013,8)Upper Mississippi.
L(793,10)mystic rocks, too, th(23,8)-marked whale remains
undecipherable. T(645,7)usion(630,8)(203,7)rocks reminds me of another
thing. Besides (516,6)e(587,7)phenomena which the exterior(218,8)Sperm
(382,6)(466,7)s, he(948,7)ldom display(529,6)back, and more especially
his flanks, effaced in great part(334,8)regular(826,8)appearance, by
reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether(268,6) ir(84,7), random
aspect. I should say(820,6)(950,6)New England(353,7)(803,7)sea-coast,
(310,6)Agassiz imagines to bear(484,6)ar(550,6)violent scraping contact(690,6)vast floating icebergs—(157,12),(158,12)(499,6)must not a
little resemble(443,10)(825,10)this(830,11). It also seems to me
that such(335,10)(976,8)(673,6)are probably made by hostile(212,14)(612,6)whales; for I have most re(760,7)them(99,8)large,
full-grown bull(870,9)species.

A word or two(617,6)concern(1003,6)is matt(512,6)the skin or blubb(23,9)
whale. It has already been said(372,7)it is stript from him in long
pieces, called blanket-(23,6). Lik(243,7)sea-terms,(396,6)one is very
happy and significant. Fo(583,6)(380,6)is indeed wrapt up in his(215,8)
as in a real(138,8) or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho
slipt over his head(980,6)skirting his extremity. It is by (926,9)
this cosy(275,8)ing of(176,6)od(721,10)(223,11)enabled to keep
himself comfortab(715,6)all weathers,(17,8)seas, times(172,6)tides.
What would become of a Greenland(729,6),(868,6)in(1024,7)shuddering, icy
sea(648,9)North, if unsupplied with (243,9)surtout? True,(780,6)
fish are found exceedingly brisk(126,10)Hyperborean waters; but
these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose(623,6)bellies are refrigerators; creatures(765,7)warm themselves under the
le(331,6)n iceberg, as a traveller in winter(384,8)ask before an inn
fire; whereas, like man,(759,11)has lungs and(144,6)blood. Freeze his
bloo(676,7)he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after
explanation—(658,7)is great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as
indispensable as it is to man; h(137,13)that he sh(661,7)(528,7)at
home, immers(775,6)his lips for life(675,10)Arctic(544,7)!(324,6), when
seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes(651,6), months(274,6)wards,

proved by experiment(670,7)the(525,6)(981,6)Polar(567,7)is warmer than

CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.

“Haul(1020,6)e chains! Le(770,6)carcase go astern!”

Slowly it floats mo(765,9)re away,(756,6)ater round it torn and

murderous din. For hour(63,6)(10,6)(154,9)almost stationary ship that
hideous sigh(511,6)een. Beneath the unclouded(501,6)ild azure sky, upon
the fair face(708,7) pleasant sea, waft(516,10)joyous breezes,(140,6)great mass of death(628,8)on and on, till(706,6)in infinite
perspectives.

There’s a most doleful(694,7)st mocking f(1004,6)! The sea-vultures all
in pious mourning(745,6)air-(429,8)ll punctiliously in black or
speckled. In life but few(999,7)m would have helpe(776,6)whale, I ween,
if peradventure he had needed it; but upo(724,6)banquet of his(227,8)
they(270,6)p(171,7)do pounce. Oh, horrible (260,7)ism of earth! from
which not the mightiest(839,6) is free.

Nor is this the end. Desecrated a(23,6)body is, a vengeful ghost
survive(719,8)vers over it to scare. Espi(596,6)some timid man-of-war

log—_shoals, rocks(149,6)breakers hereabouts: beware!_ And for years
afterwards, perhaps, ships shu(650,6)place; leaping(449,9)as silly

Thus, while in life the grea(906,7)’s(859,6)may have been a real terror

(741,7)contrary, where his head and(667,6)seem to join,(968,6), in that
very place, i(893,6)thickest part of him. Remember, also,(190,9)
(270,7) must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening
between him and his subject(960,6)that(18,8) almost hidden in a
discoloured, rolling(1018,6)oftentimes tumultuous(285,6)ursting sea. Bear
in mind, to(227,8)un(428,6)ese untoward circumstances h(445,6)to cut

full grown leviathan this is impossible; for(422,7)(270,9)’s head
embraces nearly one third(1009,6)s entire bulk(899,6)completely to suspend
such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a(411,6)r, this

A short space elapse(500,7)up into(320,6)(84,9)ness came Ahab alone
from his cabin. Tak(941,6)few turns (118,7)quarter-deck, he paused to

“Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice(410,11)ain-mast-head.

“Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,(86,8)Ahab, suddenly erecting
himself, (378,6)whole thunder-clouds swept asid(139,7)his brow. “That

CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam’s Story.

Hand in hand,(888,6)(380,6)eeze blew on; but the(24,8)came faster than

By(481,6)y, thr(902,6)he glass(531,7)ranger’s boa(912,9)nned (808,9)s
proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and
shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the

Here be it said,(695,6)like the vessels of military marines,(860,6)hips
of the American Whale Fleet have each a privat(170,8); all which

commanders are enabled(371,6)cognis(208,7)(429,6)up(652,7)ocean, even at
considerable distance(617,6)with no small facility.

her own;(348,6) (710,7)(835,8) to b(479,6)(944,8) of Nantucket.
Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under(912,11)’s lee,
and lowered a boat; it(958,6)drew nigh; but, a(921,7)ide-ladder was
(528,6)rigged by Starbuck’s order to accommodat(693,7)isiting(506,8),
(1011,12) in question waved his hand from his boat’s stern in token(743,6)at proceeding(688,7)entirely unnecessary. It turned out(857,6)the
(373,9)had a malignant epidemic on board, and(914,6)Mayhew, her
(215,8) was fearful of infecting(395,14)company. For, though
himself and(237,8)crew remained untainte(133,9)ough his(580,6)was
half a rifle-shot off(180,6)an incorruptible sea(25,6)ir rolling and

But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserv(221,6)

blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback;(621,7), indeed, at times
(207,7)sudden onset of a large(546,9)wave(272,6)boat would be pushed
some way ahead; bu(36,11)soon skilfully brought to her proper
bearings again. Subject(617,6)is(897,6)other(609,6)ike inte(729,6)ons now

sort.

Pu(868,8) oar i(118,6)(598,10) boat, was a ma(76,7)singular
appearance, even(65,6)at wild whaling life where individual
notabilities make up all tota(23,6). He(124,7)small, short, youngish
man, sprinkled all over his face(632,6)freckle(424,7)w(461,6) redundant
yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coa(648,7)faded walnut
tinge enveloped him;(911,6)verlapping sleeves of which wer(714,6)ed up on
his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.

So(726,6)as(918,6)figure had been first descried, Stubb had
exclaimed—“That’s he! t(11,9)—the(287,6)togged scaramouch the
Town-Ho’s company told us of!”(105,8)ere alluded to a strange story
told of(650,13)(866,6)a certain man among her crew, some time
previous wh(840,7)Pequod spoke the (170,7). According(973,8) account
and what(927,7)bsequently learned, it seemed(758,6)the(274,12)in

apostolic whim(271,10)ized him,(353,8)left(390,10) for Nantucket,
where,(104,6)that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,

a freshet. He(550,8)(199,14)the archangel Gabriel(245,6)commanded
the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto(806,7)by he
set(321,9)forth(128,8)deliverer(683,8)isles(696,10)a and
vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness(640,6)which
he declared these things;—the dark, daring pl(875,6)his sleepless,
excited imagination(549,6)all the preternatural terrors of real
delirium, unit(811,6)invest this(387,8) i(514,6)mind(267,9)majority of

were afraid(233,6)m. As such a man, howev(991,8)not of much practical
use(174,8)ship, especially as he refus(235,6)work except when he
pleased,(508,6)ncredulous(628,9)would fain have been r(181,9); but
apprised that that individual’s intention was to land him(363,8)first

disciples amo(140,7)(556,6)that at last in a body they went to the

broken out, he(549,9)a higher hand than ever; declar(670,6)(155,6)

stayed but according to his good pleasure(307,6)sailors, mostly poor
devils, cringed,(246,6)ome of them fawned b(567,6)him; in obedience to
(823,6)structions, sometimes rendering him personal homag(255,6)to a god.
Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous,(838,6)are true.
Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respec(902,9)m(312,6)less self-deception(279,7)(78,8) himself(456,6)is (58,11)
power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to
return(153,7) Pequod.

“I fear not thy(671,9), man,” said Ahab from the bulwarks, to C(752,6)
Mayhew, who stood in(46,6)oat’s stern; “come on board.”

But now(955,9)started(640,8)feet.

“Think, think(316,9)evers, yellow(276,6)ilious! Bewar(637,8) horribl(814,8)!”

“(113,7)!(122,8)!” cried(211,8) (211,6); “thou must either—” But that
instant a headlong wave shot(256,9) far ahea(792,7)its see(674,6)
drowned all speech.

“Hast thou see(331,6)White Whale?” demande(414,6), wh(38,7)boat drifted

“I tell thee again,(450,8), that(292,7)aga(520,11) tore(265,6) as if

success(847,7)riotous waves rolled by, which by on(530,7)ose occasional

W(549,6)is interlude was over,(761,15) began a dark story
concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent(107,6)ruptions from
(555,9)whenever his nam(143,6)mentione(815,7)the crazy sea that(221,7)
leagued(296,6)him.

I(29,8)(41,6)the Jeroboam had not long left home(828,7)upon speaking

Shaker God incarnated; the (27,6)s receiv(92,8)Bible. But when, some
year or two afterwards,(656,10) was fairly sighted from the
mast-heads, Macey,(606,6)hief mate, burn(595,8)ardour to encounter him;
(663,9)(819,7)himself(244,7)not unwilling to let him have the
opportu(341,6)despite all the(971,10)’s denuncia(829,6)and
forewarning(197,8) succeeded in persuading five men to ma(471,6)boat.
With them he pushed off; and,(345,6) much weary pulling(912,6)many
perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last(157,14)getting one iron

speedy doom(114,8)sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while

at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip(226,10)at was
harmed, nor a hair of any(247,6)an’s head; bu(108,6)mat(427,6)ever sank.

It is well to parenthesize here, tha(351,9)fatal accidents i(552,6)Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
Sometimes, nothing is injured(196,11)n who is thus annihilated;

specifically fore-announced it, instead of only mak(295,6)general
prophecy,(669,7)any one might have done, and so(18,6)chanced to hit one

Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions(158,6)m,

Ahab answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, (669,8)once(950,6)started to
his feet, glaring upo(959,6)old man(428,6)vehemently exclaimed(876,6)
downward pointed finger—“Think, think o(787,6)blasphemer—dead(521,6)down
there!—beware(47,18)’s end!”
(248,6)stolidly turned aside; then said to (497,6), “C(417,6), I(643,6)just
bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a(23,7) for on(155,7)y

Every(1001,6)-ship takes out a goodly number of(150,7)s for various
ships, whose delivery (752,7)pers(690,7)whom they may be addressed,
depends(497,10)mer(909,8) of encountering them(904,8)four oceans.
Thus, most(169,9)never reach their mark; and(982,6)are only received
after attaining an ag(518,6)wo or three years or more.

(629,6), Death himself might well(691,6)bee(918,6)post-boy.

“Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but
a dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he(306,6)tudying it out,(375,10)took a
long cutting-spade pole(994,6)with his knife slightly split the end, to
inser(19,6)(888,7)ther(71,7)in that way, hand it(758,8)boat, without

Meantime, Ahab hold(747,7)(1011,7), muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, (13,7)ry—(a
woman’s pinny hand,—the (22,6)wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—(65,9) Macey,

“Poor fellow! p(13,12)and from hi(127,7)” sighed Mayhew; “but let

“Nay, keep it thyself,(596,8)Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going

caught it(580,6)e slit(916,8)(680,10)reached it over towards the
boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desiste(396,7)rowing;

magic(123,6)(806,7)suddenly ranged along(888,6)(440,7)’s eager hand. He

CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.

I(740,6)tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a(165,7)

are wanted her(870,7)then again(930,6) (38,11)there. T(127,8)no

to be don(26,7)w(105,6)It(229,9)(63,9)with him who endeavors the
description (470,7)scene. We must now retrace our way(996,9). It was
mentioned(677,6)upon first breaking grou(712,8)(571,7)’s back, the
blubber-hook was inser(576,6)(877,7)original hole(346,6) cut by the
spades(199,8)mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that
same hook get fix(706,6)that hole?(244,7)(160,10)(603,6)by my
particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to
descend(883,10)monster(300,7) fo(1021,6)special purpose(866,6)red to.
But in very(926,6)cases, circumstances require(435,6)the(139,11) shall

concluded(987,6)(913,6) be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,
excepti(920,7)immediate parts(113,7)e(312,6). So down(894,6), some ten
feet below the level(760,8)de(651,7) poor(269,12)flounders about,
half(278,14)and half(736,9)ater,(597,6)e vast(614,6)revolves like
a tread-mill benea(937,6). O(807,6)occasion in question,(595,9) figured
(853,7)Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at
least, he appea(585,6) uncommon advantage; and no one had a better
chance to(468,8) him, as will presently be seen.

Be(463,8)savage’s bowsman,(880,6)is(401,7)erson who pull(884,6) bow-oar
in his boat (the second one from forward),(888,7) my cheerful(912,6)to

whale(941,7). You hav(242,6) Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by
a long cord. Just so,(207,6)the ship’s steep side, did I hold(545,9)
(773,10)(665,8)sea, by w(352,6) technically called(707,8)fishery a
monkey-rope, attach(544,6)a strong(1018,6) of canvas belted round his
waist.

I(385,6)a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we
proceed further, it must be said(573,6)the (186,11) was fast at both
ends;(19,6)to(853,9)’s broad(203,12), and(42,9)my narrow
leather one. So(693,6)for(788,7) or for worse, we two, for the time,
were wedded(861,6)should poor(1002,10)sink to rise no more, then(204,6)usage and honor demanded(841,8)nstead of cutt(887,8)cord, it(116,7)
drag me down (855,7)wake. So(110,6), an elongated Siamese ligature
united us.(188,10)(882,7)(84,6)separable twin brother; nor could I
any way get rid of(864,6)angerous liabilities which the hempen bond
entailed.

So(678,7)ly and metaphys(757,7)(823,6)conceive of my situati(985,6)n,
that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to
per(97,6)that(271,10)dividuality was now merg(903,6)a joint stock
company of two;(74,9)free will had received a mortal woun(604,7)that
another’s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited
disaster and death. Therefore, I saw(907,6)her(896,6)a sort of
interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity neve(552,8)have
so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—(459,6)I jerked
him now(291,7)en from between the whal(864,6)ship,(630,7)would threaten
to jam him—(121,23)(278,6)y(285,13)this(625,11)of
min(303,6)the precise(34,13) every(480,8)that breathes; only, in
most cases, he, one way or other, has(127,6)(968,8)connexion with a
plur(670,6)of(54,6)(598,7)s. If your banker breaks, you snap; i(33,6)
apothecary by(629,9)sends you poison in(80,6)pill(72,7)die. True,
you may say that, by exceeding caution(127,6)may possibly escape these
(482,7) multitudinous(217,7)evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s
monkey-rope heedfully as I(533,6), sometimes he(616,7) it so,(953,6)I
came very near sliding overboard. No(749,8)I(208,10)forget(260,7)do
what(119,10)I only ha(232,7)anagement of one end of it.*

*The (204,12)is found in all(760,6)rs; but it was(97,6)i(792,6)Pequod
(713,7)(76,8) and his holder were ever tied together. This
improv(165,6)upo(881,6)original usag(782,6)introduced by no less a man
than Stubb, in order to affor(499,6)imperilled harpooneer the strongest
(565,7)e guarantee fo(37,6)faithfulness and vigilance of hi(532,15)older.

I have hinted(506,7)(547,6) often jerk poor(607,9) from between the
whale (700,8)ship—where he(76,8)ccasionally fall,(70,6)the incessant
rolling and swaying of both(745,6)this was no(464,6)only jamming jeopardy

night,(213,7)arks now freshl(581,6)more keenly allur(96,10)before
pent blood which began to flow(262,10)carcass—the rabid creatures
swarmed r(763,6)t like bees in a beehive.

And right in among thos(192,9)was(456,9); who(486,7)pushed them
aside with his floundering feet. A thing al(810,8) incredible(845,6)it
(419,6)at attract(791,6)such prey as a dead(965,6)(359,6)otherwise
miscellaneously carnivorous(397,6) will seldom touch(876,6).

Nevertheless, it may well be believ(749,8)since they(777,6)such a
ravenous finger i(1014,6)pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to
them. Accordingly, besides(639,6)(910,10),(365,6)(543,6)I now(844,8)n

Daggoo continually flourish(79,8)his head a couple of keen
whale-spades, wherewith(449,6)slaughtered as many(952,8)as(484,6)could
reach. This procedur(181,8)irs, to be sure, was very disinterested and
benevolent(242,7)m. They meant(873,9)’s best happiness, I admit; but

water, those indiscreet (369,6)(290,10) would come nearer amputating a
leg than a tail. But(704,6)(276,8), I suppose, straining and gasping
there(795,6)that great iron hook—(80,26)only prayed
to his Yojo(325,6)gave up his life in(820,7)hands of his gods.

Well, well, my dear comrad(364,7)win-broth(313,7)ught I, as I drew in
(975,8) slacked of(802,6)rope to every swell(829,9)ea—what matters
it, after all? Are you not the pre(977,6)image of each and a(86,6)us men(623,6)is whaling world? That unsou(984,6)cean you gasp in, is Life;(544,6)

and(608,8)you are in a sad pickl(725,6)peril,(581,6)lad.

But courage! (557,6)is good cheer in store for you,(914,9). For now,
as(611,6)blue lips and(791,7)shot eyes the exhausted savage at last
climbs up(924,6)hain(70,6)stands all dripp(738,8)involuntarily
trembling over(958,6)ide;(968,6)teward advances(708,6)with a benevolent,
consolatory glanc(720,8)him—what? Some hot Cognac? No!(37,10), ye
gods(20,11) a cup of tepid ginger(459,6)ater!

“Ginger? Do I smell(39,7)?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.
“Yes,(661,6)must be(106,7),” peering(934,10)as yet untasted cup. Then
standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the
astonished(380,9)slowly saying, (242,9)(231,7)(402,7)ll you have
the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where li(610,7)virtue of

“T(1004,8)some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this
business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just
come from forward. “W(515,8)look at(222,6)kannakin, sir:(801,7)of it,
if you please.” Then wat(123,6)the mate’s countenanc(703,6)(173,7)“The

“I trust not,” said(442,11)“it is poor stuff enough.”

“Aye, aye,(1007,8),” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a
harpooneer; none of your (270,10)’s medicine here; you want to poison
us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and(71,9)murder
us all, and pocke(975,6)proceed(100,9)”

“It was not me(242,9)Dough-Boy(308,6)was Aunt Charity(943,6)brought the

but only(1023,6)(83,6)-jub—so she called it.”

“G(32,9)! you(48,7)ly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to

“Oh, I(364,7)hurt when I hit, excep(19,12) a(963,6) or(240,11)of

sir?”

“O(460,8): go down(379,6)him(365,10)what th(780,7)est thyself.”

When(895,6) reappeared, he came(457,6)a dark flask in one hand(767,6)a
sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong(666,9) and
was handed to Queequeg; the second(808,17)’s gift(905,6)that
was freely given to the waves.

It must be borne in mi(143,7) all(877,6)time we h(70,6)Sperm(99,6)’s

it. F(836,7)present(451,6) matters pres(967,7)the best(87,8)do now for

Now, dur(187,7) past night and forenoon,(271,11) had gradually

boats, Stubb’s and Flask’s,(58,6)detached in pursuit. Pulling further
and(12,8) away, they at last became almost invisible(317,8)men at
the mast-head. But suddenly i(979,6)distance(96,7)saw a great heap of
tumultuous white water(578,6)soon after news came from aloft(840,6)one or

it seemed as if he meant it malice; b(375,12)going down in a
maelstrom, within three rod(898,8) planks, he wholly disappeared from

along(753,9), (740,7)(224,6)ed line, scraping beneath(445,9),
(933,9)rose to view(840,7)her bows, snapping and quivering;(382,6)o

Meantime(992,6) hauled more an(9,7)up(318,6)ir lines,(628,6)close

At last(608,7)out grew thick(700,6)with a frightful roll and vomit, he

W(815,9)two headsmen(771,6)engaged in making fast cords to his flukes(763,6)in other ways gett(716,8)mass in readiness for (749,6), some
conversation ensued between them.

“I wonder w(772,7) old man wants(640,6)this lump of foul lard,” said
Stubb, not without some disgust(440,8)thought of having to do(738,6)so
ignoble a leviathan.

“W(135,10)it?(115,6)(796,6), coiling(111,6)spare line in(766,6)oat’s bow,

“Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can(1007,10)do t(298,8)I(626,7)know, Flask, but(921,10) is a curious chap(574,6)a wicked

“Now, (294,7)mean(126,6)you say(931,6)have been saying all a(749,6)(140,10)Mean or not mean, here we are(405,9)hip.”

The boats were(42,6)hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,
where fluke chains and other necessarie(98,7)already prepared for
secur(404,6)m.

“Didn’t I te(381,7)so?” said(982,6); “yes, y(1023,6)soon see this right
whale’s head hoisted up opposite(705,6)parmacetti’s.”

In good time,(108,6)’s(367,8)proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply
leaned over towards(781,6)perm(335,6)(156,7), now(973,9)counterpoise of
both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained,(590,6)ay
well believe. So,(876,6)on one side you(296,6) in Lock(162,10)you go
(206,6)hat way; but(188,6)(536,7)(498,6)side,(73,10)Kant’(530,6)you come
back again(69,6)in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep
trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads ove(707,6),
and then you(1004,6)float light and(591,6).

In disposing of the body of a(629,6)(808,6)(348,7)brought(929,6)side the
ship(562,6)same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
case(119,6)(592,11); only,(36,7) latter instanc(678,7)head is cut
off whole,(389,8)the former(1000,6)ip(971,6)tongue are separately removed

what is called(778,6)rown-piece. But nothing lik(1001,6)(235,9)present
case, had been done. The carcases of both(897,6)s had dropped astern;(529,8) head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair
of(613,6)urdening panniers.

Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the(596,12)(907,9)and ever
and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to(468,7)nes in his own
hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand,(1011,6)the Parsee occupied his
shadow; while, i(793,6)(42,6)’s (31,6) wa(137,8)at all it seemed only
to blend with(230,6)lengthen Ahab’s. As(537,7)ew toiled on, Laplandish
speculations were bandied amo(341,6)m, concerning(674,8)se passing
things.


CHAPTER 74(581,6)Sperm W(398,7)Head—Contrasted View.

Here, now, are two grea(454,7)s, lay(479,7)ir heads together; let us
jo(1000,6)m(265,7)ay(36,9) our own.

O(362,6)grand order of folio leviathans(1016,6)(188,11)(978,6)he Right
(20,7)re by fa(1018,6)most noteworthy. They(209,6)he only(834,7)
regularly hunted by man. T(624,6)Nantucketer, they(941,8) the two
extrem(924,6)(399,7) known varieti(951,6)the(950,6)(520,9)external
difference betwee(317,6) is mainly observable (346,6)(380,8); and as a
head of each is this moment hang(866,13)Pequod’s side(69,9)we
may freely go(914,6)on(894,9)other, by merely stepping across the
deck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better(960,7) to
study practical cetology than here?

In the first place, you are struck by(615,6)eneral c(755,7)(363,8)
(831,6)heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a
certain mathema(180,6)symmetry(438,7)(899,15)which(715,16)’s sadly lacks. T(99,8)more character(82,22)head.
As you behold it(275,6)involuntarily yiel(839,6)immense superiority to
him, in point of pervading dignity. (382,7)(786,8)instance, too, this
(44,7) is heighten(869,6)the pepper and salt colour of hi(205,6) at the
summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he
is wh(84,6) fishermen technically call a “grey-headed(952,7)”

Let us now note(76,6)is least dissimila(414,8)(600,8)—namely, the two
most important organs(31,6)ey(201,6)the ear. Far back o(748,6)side of the
head,(248,6)ow down, near the angle of either(198,6)’s jaw, if you
narrowly search(829,6)will at last see a lashless eye,(697,7)you would
fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the
magnitu(222,9)(718,7)
Now, from this peculiar sideway position(55,8)(232,8)eyes, it is
plain that he can never(222,6)n object(913,7)is exactly a(353,6)no more
than(64,8)one(39,10)stern. In a word(490,6)(153,23)
eyes corresponds(257,6)a(289,6) man’s ears; and you may fancy, for
yourself, how it(391,6) fare with you, di(61,6)(296,7)s survey(237,7)s
through your ears. Y(467,8) find(304,6)you could only command some
thirty degrees of vision in(923,8)(461,8)straight side-line of sight;
and about (82,7)more behind it. If(167,6)bitterest foe were walking
(97,9)towards(261,6)with dagger uplifted in broad day(755,7)ould not
be able to see him, an(146,7)than if h(124,7)stealing upon you from
(185,6)(528,13)(101,10)have two backs, so to speak; but, at the
same time, also, two fronts (side(13,7)): for what(849,8)hat makes
th(39,7)(605,9)—what, indeed, but hi(814,6)?

Moreover, while in most other animals(841,6)I(840,6)ow think of(759,6)eyes
are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
produce one picture and not two(825,6)e brain;(884,6)eculiar(893,12)
(893,11) eyes, effectually divid(164,6)they are by many cubic feet of
solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating
two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly(62,8)e the
impressions(135,7)each independent organ imparts. T(257,8), therefore,
must se(351,6)distinct(360,9)on this side, and an(518,6)(43,8)
(43,13)a(987,6);(569,7)all(279,9)must be profound darkness and
nothingness to him. Man may, in(428,7), be said to look out(165,6)e
world from a sentry-box(1022,6)two joined sashes for his window. But with(553,10), thes(936,6)(53,7)are(391,9)ly inserted, making two
(325,9)(90,6)s(863,6)sadly impairing the view. This(691,9)ity of(208,6)(685,11) is a thing always to be born(929,6)ind in the fishery; and
(40,6)remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.

A curious and most puzzling question might be started concern(229,6)is
(983,7)matter(980,6)uch(260,8)Leviathan(386,6)I(552,9)conten(404,6) a
hint. So long as a man(287,8)are open(258,8)light, the act of seeing
is involuntary;(691,6)is, he cannot then help mechanica(894,6)eing
whatever object(531,6)before(694,6)Nevertheless, any one’s experience
will teach him,(824,6)though(136,7) take in an undiscriminating sweep of
things at one glance, it is quite impossible(752,7)m, attentively, and
completely, to examine any two(630,6)s—however large or (17,8)small—at
one and the same instant of time; never(683,7)f they lie side by side
and(546,6) each other(926,6)if you now come to(908,9)(938,10)
(408,7), and surround(76,6)by a circle of profound darkness; then, in
order(98,6)e one(917,7)m, in such(640,6)n(722,8) bring you(224,7)to
bear on i(650,7)other will be utterly excluded from(65,6)contemporary
consciousness. How is(84,8)n,(800,6)the whale? True, both hi(799,6), in
themselves,(868,6)simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more
comprehensive, combining(364,8)btle than(923,6)(729,7)(722,7)at the
same mome(536,10)(658,12)(638,9)two distinct prosp(470,6)one on
on(567,7)of(726,7)(633,7)(357,6)(826,6)exactly opposite direction? If he
can(328,6)(340,6) as marvellous a(764,6) in(826,7)s if(505,6) were able
(328,15)to go throug(409,6)demonstrations of(221,13)
problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any
incongruity in this comparison.

It may be but an idle whim,(494,6)t has always seemed to me(447,7)the
extraordinary vacill(206,10)movement displayed by som(660,7)s when
beset by three or four boat(890,6) timidity and liability to queer
frights, so common to(910,6)(105,6); I think(634,6)all(274,6)in(506,6)ly
proceeds(879,6)the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their
divided and diametrical(616,12)powers of vision(881,6)involve them.

But the ear of(963,10) is full as curious as(43,6)ye. If you are an
entire stranger to(167,6) race, you might hunt over thes(865,6)heads for
hours(968,6)never disc(46,7)at organ. T(175,7)has no external leaf
whatever; and in(138,6) hole itsel(184,6)can hardly insert a quill, so
wondr(841,6)minute(921,6). It is lodged a little behi(1017,7)eye. With
respect(267,10)ears,(522,7)mportant difference is to be observed
between the sperm(411,7)a(109,7)right. While(453,16)former has
an(292,10)opening(854,7)(497,7)latter is (456,6)l(764,6)evenly covered
over with a membrane, so a(185,8)quite imperceptible(737,6)without.

Is it not(597,8)(992,7)so vast a being(619,8)(651,6)should see the
world through so small an eye(574,6)hear(973,6)hunder(46,9)an ear
(842,6)is(59,6)(608,6)n a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad(773,8)lens
of Herschel’s great telescope(642,6)his ears capac(839,12)porches of
cathedrals; would(752,6)make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?
Subtilize it.

Let us now(500,6)(856,8) levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant(566,6)(705,15)’s head(645,7)it may lie bottom up; then, ascending
by a ladder(851,7) summit,(118,7) peep dow(816,6)mouth(387,6)were(630,7)
that the body i(225,6)completely separated(697,6)it,(755,8)lantern we
might descend in(144,7)(512,6)Kentucky Mammoth Cave o(589,6)stomach. But
l(355,6)hold on here by this tooth(716,6)look about us where we are. What
a really beautiful and chaste-looking(273,6)!(912,6)floor to ceiling,
lined, or rather papered(1009,8)glistening white membrane, glossy as
bridal satins.

But come out now(208,12)t(232,6)portentous lower jaw, (927,6)seems
like(882,6)ong narrow lid of an immense snuff-box(433,7)the hinge at one
end, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,
and expose its rows of teeth, it(181,6) a terrific portcullis(654,6)such,
alas! it proves to many a poor wight i(715,6)fishery, upon whom these
spikes fall(933,6)impaling force. But far more(146,6)ble is it to behold,
when fathoms(834,6)(122,7)sea, you see some sulky(966,6), floating there
suspended(820,7)his prodigious(474,6)some fifteen feet long, hanging
stra(862,6)own at right-angles(87,10)body, for all the world like a
ship’s jib-boom. This(182,6)(1012,6)t dead; he is only dispirited; out of
sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac(462,7)o supine, that(631,10)s(1011,7)
jaw have relaxed, leaving him(314,6)(489,6)at ungainly sort of plight, a
reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon
him.

In most cases(906,6)(895,9)—being easily unhinged by a practised
artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
the ivory(835,8)and furnishing a supply of(353,6)hard white(646,6)bone
with whic(1016,6)(817,6)men fashion all sorts of curious articles,
including canes, umbrella-stocks(151,6)handl(940,6)riding-whips.

With a(715,7)weary(263,6) the jaw is dragg(280,6)board, as if it were an
anchor(601,6)whe(1022,6)proper time comes—(836,6)ew days afte(354,6)other
work—Queequeg, Daggoo(344,6)Tashtego, (483,6)all accomplished dentists,
are set to drawing(417,6). (236,7)keen cutting-spade, (118,8) lances
the gums; t(206,8)(269,7)la(112,6)own(335,6)ngbolt(361,7)a tackle(167,6)
rigged from aloft, they drag out these(577,9)s Michigan oxen drag
stumps of old oaks(997,7) wild wood lands. There are generally
forty-two(679,6) in all; in old(650,6)s, much worn down, but undecayed;
nor filled(438,7)our artificial(686,8). T(567,10)afterwards sawn
into slab(661,7)piled away like joists for building houses.


CHAPTER 75(101,6)Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.

Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look a(764,6)Right
(96,8)head.

As in(349,8) shape the noble Sperm(147,9)head may be compared to a
Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly
rounded); so, at a(27,6) view,(189,10)(138,14)bears a rather
inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred
y(82,6)go a(588,6)Dutch voyager likened its(298,8)o that of a
shoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe,(59,7)ld woman of the
nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be
lodged, she(962,6)ll her progeny.

But as you come nearer(206,6)is great(494,6)it begins to assume different
aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on(323,6)ummit
and(679,12)se two F-shaped spoutholes, you would tak(680,6)whole
head for an enormous bass-viol(925,6)(92,6)spiracles(599,6)apertures in
its sounding-board. Then, again, i(198,6)fix(229,6)eye upo(482,8)trange,
crested, comb-like incrustation on the top(500,7) mass—(380,8)en,
barnacled thing, whic(521,6)Greenlanders call the “crown,”(235,8)
Southern fishers(38,6)bonnet”(120,8)(854,11); fixing(218,9)s
solely(175,6)i(383,22)(377,9)the trunk of some huge oak,
with a bird’s nest i(515,6)crotch. At any rate, when(491,6)atch those
live crabs(882,6)nestle here(161,8) (221,6), such an idea will be almost
sure to occur(686,7); unless, indeed,(707,6)fancy has been fixed by the
technical term(382,7)” also bestowed(539,6)it; in(448,7)case(710,6)ill
take(877,7)inter(281,7)thinking how(913,6)mighty monster is actually a
diademed king(593,8)sea, whose(594,6) crown(205,10)put together for
him(124,7)s marvellous manner. But if(744,6)whale be a king, he is a
very sulky looking fellow to grace a (175,6). L(1011,9)at hanging lower
lip! what a(582,6)sulk and pout is there! a(26,14), by
carpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five(19,6)deep; a
(114,14)that(585,6)yield you(740,6)500 gallons of oil and more.

A(477,7)pity, now,(700,6)this unfortunate(338,7)should be hare-lipped.
The fissur(359,6)bout a foot across. Probably the mother during an

earthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over(901,6)lip, as over a slippery
threshold, we now slide into(183,7)uth. Upon my word were I at
Mackinaw, I(297,8)take(1017,6)to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good
Lord!(579,6)(584,6) road(646,6)Jonah went? The roof(371,10)twel(551,7)

ridge-pole(718,6); whi(13,6)se ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us
with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of(969,6)bone,
say three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the
head or crown bone, form(164,7)Venetian blinds(90,7)have elsewhere
been cursorily mentioned. The edges(111,7)se bones are fringed with
(304,6)fibres, through(201,7)the Right W(888,6)train(525,6)water(474,6)in
whose intricacies he ret(47,9)small fish(814,6) openmouthed he goes

(329,6)as they st(160,6) their natural order,(622,7)are certain curious
marks, curves, hollows(712,7)idges, whereby some(545,6)men calculate the
creature’s ag(152,9) ag(889,8)oak by its circular rings. Th(268,8)
(159,7)ty(573,6)is criterion is far(618,6)demonstrable, yet it h(269,6)
savor(1008,6)alogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we
must grant a far greater age to(561,17)than at first glance
will seem reasonable.

In old tim(649,6)ere(38,6)to(760,6)prevailed the most(432,8) fancies
concerning(757,8)linds. One voyager in Purchas calls the(934,6)wondrous
“whiskers” inside(950,7)(488,6)’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a
third old gentleman in Hackluyt use(844,6)following elegant language:
“T(678,9)about two hundred and fifty fins gr(70,6)on each (186,8)his
upper _chop_,(992,7)arch over his tongue(61,20)(239,6).”

*This reminds us that(503,17)really has a sort of (339,7), or
rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the(210,7)pa(95,6)the outer end(431,8)lower jaw. Sometim(370,6)se tufts
impart a (146,7)brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
countenance.

As every one know(711,6)se same(546,16),” “fins,” (622,9),”
“(690,6),” or whatever you please, furnish(879,8)ladi(583,6)ir busks and
other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has
long been(372,7) decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time(532,10)bone was
in its glory(101,6)farthingale be(945,7)n all(31,7)shion. And as those
ancient dames moved(789,7)gaily, though(218,6)e jaws(953,13), as
you may say; even so, in a shower, with(576,6)ike(85,7)tlessness, do we
nowadays fly under th(492,7)jaws for protection; the umbrella(244,7)a
tent spread(906,6)(68,9)bone.

But now forget all(243,7)(553,6) and(859,8)(115,6)a moment, and,
standing(277,8)(936,11)’(985,7), look around you afresh. Se(167,6)ll
(822,6)colonnades of(480,6)so methodically rang(408,8), woul(84,6)not
think you were inside(958,8)great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its
thousand pipes? For a carpet(791,8)organ we have a rug(523,8)softest
Turkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were,(880,8)floor(598,7)
mouth. It is very fat and tender(192,6)ap(151,6)ear in pieces in hoisting
it on deck. T(916,14)(156,7) now before us; at a passing glance I
should say i(929,6)a six-barreler;(924,6)is, it will yie(417,7)(842,6)that
amount of oil.

Ere this, you must(344,6)plainly see(883,6)truth of what I started
with—that the Sperm(644,6)(301,6)(664,14)(436,7)lmost entirely
different heads. To sum up, then:(738,22)there is no
(610,6)well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible
of a lower jaw, like(215,16)’s. Nor(885,8)(241,13)re
(149,6)any(764,6)ose(975,8)(854,7); no huge(105,7)lip; and scarcely
anything of a(705,7). Again,(337,19)s two external
spout-holes(46,6)(403,12)only one.

Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded(410,6), while they yet
lie together; for one(638,6)soon sink, unrecorded,(458,8)sea;(974,6)ther
will not be(877,6)long in following.

Can you catch the expression(951,7)(425,14)(546,6)?(965,7)the same
he died with,(275,6)some(67,8)longer wrinkl(974,6)the forehead seem now
faded away. I think his broad brow to be fu(663,6)a prairie-like
placidity, born(495,6)speculative in(794,8)ce as to death. But mark the
other head’s(275,11). See that amazing(626,10), pressed by
accident agains(969,6)vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrac(797,6)jaw.
Does not this whole (303,10)to speak of an enormous practical
resolution in facing(238,6)? This(757,13)I take to have been a
Stoic(598,6)(944,11), a Platonian, who might(59,6)taken up Spinoza in
his latter years.


CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.

Ere quitting, for the nonce(902,17)’s head, I would(197,6)you,
as a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front
aspect, in all its compacted collectedness.(127,17)
investigate it now wit(875,6)sole view of forming to yourself some
unexaggerat(1005,6)telligent estimate of whatever b(327,9)ram power may
be lodged(963,6). Here is a vital point; for you must either
satisfactorily settle(663,6)m(470,6)with(185,9), or for ever remain an
infidel(888,7)one of the most appalling, but(761,7)e less true events,
perhaps anywhere to be found(422,8)recorded history.

You observ(963,7)in the ordinary swimming position(159,8)(763,12)
the(537,6) of hi(633,6) presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the
water; y(148,16)the lower part(288,6)at(113,7)slopes
considerably backwards, so(346,7)furnish more of a retreat(838,9)long
socket which receives the boom-lik(140,8)jaw(172,22)
mouth is entirely unde(939,6)(914,6)much(363,8)same way, indeed, as
thoug(573,6) own (83,6)were(85,16)your chin. Moreov(20,6)
(322,17)whale has no external nose; and(511,6)what nose he
has—his spout hole—is o(546,6)top(493,12)(439,19)his eyes
and ears are (464,7)sides(558,12), nearly one third(588,8)(326,6)
length from (624,9). Wherefore,(930,10)now have perceive(222,7)the
(679,9)(709,15)’(693,7)is a dead, blind wall, without a single
organ or tender prominenc(606,6)ny sor(337,6)soever. Furtherm(173,9)are
now to (704,8)(902,6)only(907,8)extreme,(771,6),(733,9) sloping part
(918,7)(222,13)(620,6)is there(621,6)lightest vestige of bon(516,6)
not till you get near twenty feet(383,11)orehead do you com(969,9)full cranial development. So(979,8)is whole enormous boneless mass is
as one wad. Finally, (794,6), as will soon be revealed, its contents
partly compris(261,6)most delicate oil; yet(403,9) (403,7)be apprised(351,8)nature(574,8)substance which so impregnably invests all that
apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I(705,6)described t(359,6)how
the blubber wraps the body(728,8)whale, a(26,6)rind(41,7)an orange.
Just so with(559,9); but(19,8)is difference: abou(957,6)head this
envelope(408,8) not so thick, is of a(475,10)toughness, inestimable
by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the
sharpest lance darted by(761,6)trongest human arm, impotently rebounds
from it. It is(323,6)oug(291,6)(757,9)(879,7)Sperm Whale were paved
with horses’ hoofs. I do not think(999,6)any sensation lurks in it.

Be(41,6)yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
chance to crowd and crush towards each (84,6)in the docks, what d(979,6)sailors do? They(206,8)suspend between them, a(552,6)point of coming
contact,(493,6)erely hard(842,10), like iron or wood. No, they hold
there a(240,8)round w(404,7)ow(225,6)ork, (669,8)d(216,8)thickest and
toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured take(874,6)jam(1010,6)
would(938,6)snapped(1006,7)eir oaken handspikes and(218,6)crow-bars. By
itself(880,6)suffici(660,6)illustrat(120,7)obvious fact I drive at. But
supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me,(654,7)s
ordinary fish possess(520,6)is called a swimming bladd(568,9)m,
capable, at will, of distensi(468,6)contraction; and(867,6)(844,13),
as far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, to(561,6)
otherwise inexplicable mann(749,6)which he now depresses his head
altogether beneath the surface,(191,6)non swims with it high elevated
out of the water(174,13) the unobstructed elasticity of its
(712,8)(57,20)ique interior of(188,9);(507,7)

honeycombs (897,6)may possibly(770,7)ome hitherto unknown and
unsuspected connexion(302,6)the outer air, so as to be susceptible to
atmospheric(594,12)(1007,6)(595,9). I(843,7)be so, fancy the
irresistibleness(405,6)at might, to(528,7)the most impalpable and
de(421,6)ive of all e(883,6)s(726,6)ibutes.

Now, mark. Unerringly impell(501,6)is dead, impregn(822,6)uninjurable
wall(610,6)this(145,6)buoyant thing within;(401,7)(643,6)behind it all a
ma(233,7)remendous life, only(361,7)adequately estimated as piled wood
is—by the cord(952,7)ll obedient to one volition,(982,8)smallest
insect. So(620,6)when I shall hereafter detail to you all the
specialities(498,8)centrations of potency everywhere lurking in this
expansive monster;(134,14)show you(714,6)(844,7)more
in(947,8)able braining feats; I trust you will(784,6)renounced all
ignorant incredulity(479,6)be ready to abide by this;(918,9)ugh the
Sperm Whale stove a passage thr(40,8) Isthmus of Darien(585,6)mixed
the Atlantic(901,10)Pacific,(197,6)ould not elevate one hair of your
eye-brow. For unless you own the whale(79,6)are but a provincial and
sentimentalist in Truth. But clear(17,6) is a(758,7)for salamander
giants(719,9)encounter; how(639,6)(696,6)hances for the(138,11)s
then? What befe(50,7)weakling youth lift(956,6)e dread goddess’s veil
at Lais?


CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.

Now come(812,6)Baling of the Case(265,6)to comprehe(987,7)right(427,6)must
know some(291,6)(66,7)curious internal structure(100,8)(47,7)perated
upon.

Regard(236,8)(628,11)’s head as a solid oblong(139,7)ay, on an
inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* where(254,7)lower
i(281,6)bony(189,10), form(395,8)cranium and jaws(852,6)the upper an
unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end(107,12)
expanded vertical apparent forehead(445,8)whale. At the middl(373,8)
(44,9)horizontally sub(284,7)this(189,7)quoi(956,7)then you have two
almost equal parts, which before were naturally(379,7)d by an(533,9)
wall of(864,6)ck tendinous substance.

*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to(865,6)ure nautical
mathematics. I know not that it has been defined(196,7). A(544,6) is a
(628,6)(229,6)differs(452,6)a wedge in having its sharp(455,9)(251,6)the
steep (676,6)ation of one side, inst(460,11)mutual taper(928,7)both
sides.

T(687,8)(452,10)d part, calle(654,6)junk, is one immense honeycomb of
oil(731,6)(169,9) crossing and re(15,8),(829,7)en thousand
infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout it(791,6)e
extent. T(832,9)(201,6)known a(911,6)Case, may be regarded(29,8)great
Heidelburgh Tun(791,8)Sperm W(797,7)n(53,7)at famous(61,6) tierce is
mystically carved in front, s(615,6)whale’s vast plaited(911,10)forms
innumerable strange devices for the embl(673,6)al adornment of his
wondrous tun. Moreover,(192,9)of (243,12)was always replenished
with(595,6)ost excell(101,7)the wines(630,8)Rhenish valleys(240,9)tun
(48,8)hale contains by fa(205,6)most precious of all his oily
vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,
limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this(140,10)substance found
unalloy(474,6)any oth(630,7)(896,8)creature. Though in life it remains
perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure t(561,6)air, after death, it soon
begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when
the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A larg(721,9)
case generally yields about five hundred gallons of(438,6), t(296,6)from
unavoidable circum(384,6)s, consid(792,7)of it is spilled, leaks, and
dribbles away, (473,6)otherwise irrevocably lost in(684,6)icklish
busines(164,6)ecuring what you can.

I know not with(31,6)fine and costly material the(882,13)Tun was
coated within, but in superlative richnes(953,7)coating could not
possibly have compar(82,7) the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like
the lining of a(200,6)pelisse,(509,9)the inner surface(1021,8)Sperm
W(522,6) case.

It will(152,6)been seen(199,6)(271,20)(76,12) Whale
embraces the entire length(877,8)(21,7)top(895,8)head; and since—as
has(129,6)elsewhere set(804,6)—(52,8) (109,9)one third(978,8)whole

for a good sized(831,6), you(449,6)more than twenty-six fe(175,6) the
dep(256,10)tun, when(782,7)(286,6)wise hoisted up and(142,7)gainst a
ship’s side.

As in decapit(610,6)(249,6)al(226,6) operator’s instrument is brought
close to(629,6)pot (362,6)an entrance is subsequently forced in(55,6)
spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest
a careless, untimely stroke should invade(801,6)anctuary and wastingly
let out its invaluable contents. It is this(314,10)ed en(569,8)
head, also, which is at last elevated out(618,9)ater, and retained in
that position by(784,7)ormous cu(636,7)ackles, whose hempen
combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes i(943,6)
quarter.

Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you,(526,6)at marvellous and—in
this particular instance—almost fatal(629,7)ion(588,6)(249,7)Sperm
Whale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.


CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.

Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft;(546,6)ithout altering his erect
posture, runs straigh(582,6)upon(841,6)verhanging mainyard-arm(302,7)e
par(828,8)it exactly projects over th(992,10)Tun. He has carried
with him a light(540,7) called a whip, consisting of only two parts,
travelling through a single-sheaved block. Secur(41,6)is(21,6), s(510,6)
it hangs down from the (249,10)he swings one(832,11) rope, till it
is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down
the other part, the Indian drops(238,9)the air(130,7)dexterously he
lands (469,7)summi(966,9)head. There—still high(1009,10)above the
res(1020,9)company, to whom he vivaci(116,6)cries—he seems some Turkish
Muezzin ca(432,8)e good people to prayers(384,10)top of a tower. A
short-handled sharp spade(1005,8)ent up to hi(440,6)diligently searches
fo(673,6)proper place to begin breaking in(753,6)(705,6)In(572,7)usiness

sound(274,8)walls to find(867,7)(298,6)ld is masoned in. By(293,6)ime
th(635,6)tious(232,7) i(907,6), a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like
a well-(30,8)has been attached to(770,16)whip; whil(561,6)(696,6)end,(404,8)tretched across the deck, is there(804,9)two or
three alert hands. These last now hoist the(202,7) within grasp(925,7)

Insert(686,6)is pole(532,10)(322,8)Tashtego downward guides the

(647,7)seamen a(249,6)whip, up com(111,6)(268,8)again, all bubbling(479,8)dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered(909,6)its height, the
full-freighted vessel (643,6)ght by an appointed hand, and quickly
emptied(867,6)a large tub. Then remounting aloft, i(215,7) goes through
the same round until(608,7)ep cistern will yield no more. Toward(422,6)end(456,11)has to ram his(528,10) harder and(11,7)(211,6)deeper
(11,10)(495,15)(149,6)some twenty feet(831,8)(90,7)ve gone
down.

Now,(31,6)eople(876,8)Pequod had(919,6)baling(92,7)ime in(683,6)way;
several tubs(52,10)filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once
a queer accident happened. Whether it was that(784,9),(15,6)wild(905,9)was so heedless and reck(13,6)s to let go for a moment his
one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspend(835,8)head; or
w(175,7)the place where he stood(160,8)treacherou(163,6)oozy(65,17)Evil One himself would(459,6)it to fall out so, without
stating his particular reasons; how(335,8)exactly, there is no telling
now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or nine(13,6)bucket came
suckingly up—my God! poor(778,9)—like the twin reciproc(192,6)(75,6)
in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down(795,8)is(442,7)Tun of
Heidelburgh(853,6)with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of
sight!

“Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid(573,6)eneral consternation first
came to his senses. “Sw(596,8)(330,7)(877,8)!” and putting one foot
into it, so(411,8)better to secure(98,6)lippery hand-(737,12)whip
itself,(718,6)oisters ran him high up to(428,6)op of(761,9), almost
before(927,9) c(687,10)(751,6)d its interior bottom. Meantime(647,7)
was a te(409,7)tumult. Looking ov(865,7)sid(52,6)y saw(251,7)fore
lifeless head throbbing and heaving just belo(58,6)surface(217,8)sea,
as if that moment seize(572,7)some(24,7)ous idea;(1007,6)as(865,8)only
the(759,6)Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggle(874,6)perilous
depth to which he had sunk.

A(555,7)instant, while(662,9)(492,7)summit(446,14)was clearing
(529,8)—(100,7)ad somehow got foul(508,8)(863,6)c(657,7)tackles—a
sharp cracking noise was heard; and(586,8)unspeakable horror of all,

vast vibr(890,6)the(75,10)mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship
reeled and shook (537,6)smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,
upon(443,7)(135,6)tire strain now depended, seemed every(466,8) to be
(949,7)point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent
motions(969,12).

“Come down, c(11,8)!” yelled(794,8)men to(604,9)but(786,6)one hand
holding on(490,8)heavy(549,8), so(855,6)i(649,10) should drop, he

sea! But hardly ha(904,6)blinding vapor(931,9)away, when a naked
figure(532,8)boarding-sword in(688,6)and(240,6)for one swift moment seen
hovering(333,10)bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced(1009,6)my
brave Queequeg had dived(339,8)rescue. One packed rush was made(379,7)
side(480,6)every eye counte(18,8)ripple, as(199,8)followed(215,7),
(543,6) sign of eith(552,7)sinker o(566,6)diver could be seen. Some hands
now jum(844,9)a boat along(169,10)pushed a little off(792,6)the
ship.

“Ha! ha!” cried (682,8)all at once,(845,6)his now quiet,(784,9) perch
overhead(846,6)looking further(122,13) (330,6)we saw an arm thrust
upright(44,10)blue waves; a sight strange to se(368,6)(70,14)forth(112,10)grass(947,6)a grave.

“Both! both!—it is(12,6)”—(264,12) again(715,8)joyful shout; and
soon after,(611,10)was seen boldly striking out(790,6)on(457,6), and
with the other clutching the long hair(928,7) Indian. Drawn(510,6)the
waiting boat, they were quickly brought(1012,8)deck; but Tashtego was
long in coming to(754,6)(830,9)did not look very brisk.

Now, how had t(556,6)bl(863,8) been accomplished? Why, diving(323,6)(871,6)lowly descending head(350,12)ith his keen sword had(940,6)side
lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then
dropping his(99,6),(216,7)rust his(408,6)arm far inwards and upwards(1004,6)so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first
(792,6)i(406,6)for him, a l(616,7)presented(461,6)well know(575,6)at that
was not as it (521,9)be(479,6)might occasion great trouble;—he had(138,7) back(665,6)eg(541,6)by a dexterous heave and toss(312,6)w(637,7)a
somerse(228,7)(720,10); so(253,6)(782,9)next trial, he came (986,6)in
the good old way—head foremost. As for(1023,7)eat head itself(358,7)was
doing as(313,6)as could be expected.

And thus, throug(941,6)courag(234,6)(306,6)skill in obstetrics of
(829,8),(889,7)liverance, or rather,(24,8)y of(915,9), was
successfully(835,13), i(323,6)teeth, too, of the most untoward and
apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means(559,6)
forgotten. Midwifery sh(309,8)taught(151,8)sam(295,6)se(950,6)fencing
and boxing, riding and rowing.

I know(704,8)is queer adventure(229,8)Gay-Header’s will be sure to
seem incredible to some landsmen, th(461,8)y themselves may have
either seen or heard of(71,6)one’s fall(925,6)to a cistern ashore; an
accident(351,7)not seldom happens(899,6)with much less reason too tha(751,6)(809,6)’s, consider(997,6)e exceeding slipperiness(523,8)curb(535,7)
Sperm Whale’(757,6).

But, per(352,9), it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We(328,7)t
the tissu(667,6)filtrated(892,6)(665,7)(130,11), was the lightest and
most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of
a far(1022,6)er specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at
all, but I(35,6)ye; for at(892,6)ime poor Tash fell in(1004,6)case had
been nearly emptied of its(251,7)r contents, leaving little but the
dense tendinous wall(1006,8)well—a double welded, hammered substance,
as(200,8)before said,(634,6)heavier(282,6)the sea water(676,6)a lump of
(716,6)sinks in it like lead almost. B(184,6) tendency to rapid sinking
in(990,6)(159,9) was i(124,6)present in(28,7)materially counteracted
by the other part(761,9)head remaining undetached from it, so that it
sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair
chance for performing his agile obstetrics o(355,6)run, as you may say.
Yes, it was a running delivery, so(30,7).

Now, had Tashtego perished(330,6)at head, it had been a(233,6)precious
(51,6)ing; smother(63,8)e(275,6)whi(928,8) daintiest of fragrant
spermaceti; coffined, hearsed(576,6)tomb(88,10)secret inner chamber
and sanctum(8,6)orum(742,9)hale. Only one sweeter end can readily be
recalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking(26,6)(675,6)e crotc(57,6) hollow tree, found such exceeding store(992,6), that
leaning too far over, it sucked him in(655,10)he died embalmed. How
many, think ye,(967,6)likewise fallen into Plato’s(223,6)(512,7)and
sweetly(547,10)there?


CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.

To sca(917,6)lines of his face, or feel the bump(730,9)head(906,6)is
Leviathan;(1011,6)is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has
as yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as
for Lavater to(326,6)scrutiniz(276,6) wrinkle(935,9)Rock of Gibraltar,
or for Gall(71,9)mounted a ladder and manipulat(92,7)Dome(723,7)
Pantheon. Still,(948,9)famous work(368,7),(181,9)not only treats of
the variou(408,6)s of men, but also attentively studies the(47,9)
horses, birds, serpents(956,6)fish;(1023,6)wells in detail up(498,6)
modifications of expression discernible(629,6)in. Nor(709,6)Gall and his
disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the
p(566,9)cal characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,
though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer(434,7)e appl(252,7)(401,7)se two semi-sciences(195,6)e whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all
things; I achieve what I can.

(819,11)cally regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
has no proper nose. And since the nose i(562,6)centra(433,6)most
conspicuous(729,7) f(94,6)s(564,6)(72,6)it perhaps most (560,6)es and
finally controls their combined(588,11); he(79,7)(1003,11)that
its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect
the countenanc(941,8)(437,6). For as in landscape gardening, a spire,
cupola, monument, or tower of(703,6)sort, is deemed almost indispensable
(563,7)comple(608,7) the scene; so no face can be p(535,16)in
keeping without the elevated open-work belfry(454,8)(522,6)Dash the
nose from Phidias’s marble Jove, and(673,6)a sorry remainder!
Nevertheless, Leviathan is(271,6) mighty a magnitude, all his
proportions are so stately, tha(207,6)same deficiency which(928,7)
sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is
an added grandeur. A(796,6)(985,12)(664,7)have been impertinent. As
on your(425,15) voyage you sail round his vast head i(59,6)
jolly-boat,(76,6)noble concep(297,6)of him are never insulted by the
reflection(325,6)he has a(210,9)be pulled. A pestilent(101,6)it,(354,6)
so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the(501,6)iest
royal beadle on his throne.

In(817,6)particulars, perhaps(72,6)ost imposing(344,17)iew to
be had(975,8)Sperm Whale, is(584,6)(1003,7)full front(326,6)s head. This
aspect is sublim(161,7)thought, a fine human brow is like the East(266,6)troubled wit(865,6)morning. In the repose(1008,8)pasture, the curled(95,6)(942,7)bull has
a touch(966,8)grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,
the elephant’s(201,9)majestic. Human or animal(152,6)mystical(249,8)

creatures, nay in man himself, very(708,7)the(436,9)but a mere strip
of alpine land lying alo(717,7)snow line. Few ar(498,6)foreheads(816,7)like Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,
that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless(487,10)lakes;
and all above them i(636,6)(182,8)’s wrinkles, you(97,6)to track the
antlered(771,8)s(174,8)(998,7)re to drink, a(945,6)Highland hunters

high and mighty god-like dignity inheren(73,9)(928,8)so immensely
amplified,(700,7)azing on it,(289,6)at full front view(286,6)feel the
Deity and(193,6)read powers more forcibly than in beholding any other
object in living nature. For(397,8) no one point precisely; not one
distinct f(773,6) is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;
he has none, proper; nothing but(998,6)one broad firmament of a
(773,8), pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering(30,6)the doom of boats,
and ships(791,6)men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous(980,6)diminish;
(682,6)(478,6)way viewed its grandeur(70,6)not domineer upon(772,6)o. In

depression(885,19)middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark
of genius.

But how? Genius(972,8)(808,11)? H(898,7)(829,11) ever written a
book, spoken a speech? No, his(893,7)(117,6) is declared in his doing

Champollion decipher(484,7)wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is
no (75,12)to(78,9) the Egypt of every man’s and(16,7)being’s

fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read(390,6)irty languages, could

meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope t(148,7)the awful Chaldee of

can.


CHAPTER 80. The Nut.

(306,6)(919,13)be p(397,9)ically a Sphinx,(794,7) phrenologist
his brain seems(151,6)geometrical circle which(988,7)impossible to
square.

I(803,6)full-grown creature(404,6)kull will measure at least twenty feet
in length. Unhing(63,6)lower jaw, an(486,8)de view of this(100,7)is as
(34,9)of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
base(827,6)in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this(94,16)is
angularly filled up(196,6)almost (321,6)d by the enormous superincumbent
mass(233,6)e junk and sperm. At the high e(286,8)kull forms a crater to
bed(637,6)part(81,8)mass; while (793,6)(372,6)ng floor(354,9)(72,6)—in
an(992,6)cavity seldom exceeding ten inches (467,9)(247,6)s many in
depth—reposes(137,6)ere handful(471,9)monster’(683,7)(773,6)(694,6)is at
(582,17) from his apparent forehead(457,8);(718,7)hidden away
behind its vast outworks, lik(711,6)innermost citadel within the
amplified fortifications of Quebec. So(77,6)a choice caske(857,6)t
secreted in him,(913,6)I(624,6)known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
tha(531,6)Sperm Whale has any (440,6)(1014,6)than(527,8)lpable semblance
of one form(672,10)cubic-yards of his(646,6) magazine. Lying in
strange folds, courses(962,6)convolutions, to their apprehens(24,6)it
seems more in keeping with(401,6)dea(137,8)general might to regar(752,6)
mystic(759,9)him a(629,6)sea(19,7)s intelligence.

It is plain, then(402,7)phrenologicall(954,6)head(809,9)Leviathan, in
the creature’s liv(290,6)tact state, is an entire delusion. As for his
tru(760,7), you can then see no ind(626,12)it, nor feel any. The
whale(721,7)all things(616,6)are(316,6)y, wears a false brow(421,7)
common world.

If you unload(528,6)kull(130,6)(541,7)y heaps and(178,6)take a rear view
(46,7)rear end, which i(418,6)high(23,6)you will be struck by its
re(698,9)(591,7) human(143,6), beheld (939,6) same situation(659,6)from
(29,9)point of view. Indeed, place(484,6)reversed(241,7)(scaled down
(130,13)magnitude) among a plate of men’(307,7)(794,7)you would
involuntarily confound it(767,9)m; and remarking the depress(520,6)n
one(758,9)its summit, in(711,14) phrase(128,10) say—This man
had no self-esteem(969,6)no venerat(688,6)nd by those neg(656,6),
considered alo(962,12)affirmative fac(907,9)prodigious bulk and
power(766,10)best form to yourself the truest, though not the most
exhilarating conception of wha(41,10) exalted potency is.

But if from the compar(191,6)dimen(377,7)(136,6)whale’s proper(958,11)
deem it incapable of being adequately charted,(1001,6)I have another idea
for you. (905,7)attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine(141,6)(851,15)(412,9)(853,12)(977,7)vertebræ to a strung
neckla(37,6)dwarf(790,8)s, all bearing rudimental(91,13)(944,6)
(840,6)(299,6). It is a German(425,6)it, t(420,8)(138,9)are absolutely
undevelop(133,9). Bu(513,6)curious extern(135,14), I take it the
(121,6)s were(578,9)first men to perceive. A foreign friend once
pointed it out to me, in the skelet(632,6)a foe he had slain(861,6)with
(236,13)of which he was inlaying, in a so(1001,6)basso-relievo, the
beaked prow(867,8)canoe. Now, I (931,8)(354,10)phrenologists have
omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations(823,9)
cerebellum throug(625,6)spinal canal. For I believe(505,6)much(306,6)man’s
character (708,8)found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel
your(785,6) than (16,6)kull, whoever(862,6)re. A thin joist(446,6)spine
n(39,6)et upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my(905,8)as in
(613,7)m audacious staff of(763,6)flag(516,7)I fling half(610,8)the
world.

Apply thi(1005,6)al bran(321,6)(476,9)y(895,7) Sperm Whale. His cranial
cavity is continuous wit(435,6)(786,6)neck-(914,7)a; and(744,6)at(936,8)a
the bottom(205,6)(495,14)(449,6)measure ten inches across, being
eight in height(808,6)of a triangular figure(164,10)base downwards. As
it passes(640,13)remaining(882,10)the(161,7)tapers in size, but
for a(827,9)able distanc(77,8)s of large capacity(883,7)of course,
t(911,7)al is fille(1022,6)(753,6)the same strangely fibrous sub(111,6)—the
(832,8)ord—as(252,6)rain(402,6)directly communicate(458,11)brain. And
what is still more, for many feet after emerging(985,9)(111,6)’s(565,7),(982,13)ord(277,12)an undecreasing girth, almost equal
to(1016,6)(561,7)(163,7)Under all these circum(375,6)s,(992,7)it be
unreasonable to survey and map(822,6)he whale’(808,6)e(797,10)ically?
For, viewe(728,7)is l(640,6)the wonderful comparative smallness of his
brain proper is more than compensated by(84,26)
magnitude(84,7)(348,12).

But leaving(1016,6)hint to operate as it may(961,10)(237,10)sts, I
(319,6)merely assume(942,12)theory (762,6)moment, in reference to the
Sperm W(346,7)hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one
(507,7)larger(920,9)(1017,6)is, therefore, in some sor(410,7)outer
convex mould of it. From its rel(432,7)ituation then, I should call(931,6)high hump(93,6)rgan of firm(489,6)r indomitableness(559,6)e Sperm
Whale. And(727,6)the great monst(535,6)(66,11), you will yet have
(720,6) to know.


CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.

The predestinated day arrived(339,6)we duly me(794,6)ship Jungfrau,
Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.

At one ti(569,7)greatest whaling people(283,8)world(841,6)Dutch and
Germans are now among(521,6)east; but here and(516,6) at very wide
intervals of lat(822,6)and longitud(350,7)still occasionally meet with
their flag(457,8)Pacific.

For(623,6)(402,6)(625,6)(298,8) seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
While yet(699,6)distance from(113,6)equod, she rounded to(768,6)dropping a
boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standin(223,8)
bows instead (891,7)stern.

“What has he in his h(383,9)?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something
wavingly held by the (496,6). “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”

“Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr.(147,9); he’s
coming off to make us our(57,7), is the Yarman; don’t(558,6)ee(955,6)big
tin can(639,8)longside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s all
right(116,15).”

“Go(85,6) with you,(356,8)Flask, “(240,7)(295,11) and an oil-can.
He’s out of oil(998,6)has come a-begging.”

However curious it may seem for(87,8)ship to be borrowing oil o(580,6)whale-ground(111,7)(89,7)much(86,8)invertedly contradict the old
proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle,(828,9)times such a (619,6)really happens; and(968,8)present case C(819,7)Derick De Deer did
indubitab(168,6)duct(369,16)s(399,6) did declare.

As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
heeding what he had(888,12); but(905,8)broken lingo,(851,11)
soon evinced his complete ignorance(1001,8)White Whale; immediately
turning the conversation to his(640,17)oil can(209,6) some
remarks touching(198,7)ving to turn in(80,7)hammock at night in
profound darkness—(122,6)st drop of Bremen oil being gone(753,6)not a
single flying-fish yet captured to supply(432,7)ficiency; concluding by
hint(272,6)at his ship was indeed(434,6)(618,7)Fishery is technically
called a _clean_ one (that is, an empty one), well deser(306,6)he name
of Jungfrau or the Virgin.

His necessities(219,6)ied,(744,8)departe(585,7)(609,7)not gain(558,6)

mast-heads of both vessel(915,7)so eager f(195,7)chase was(914,7), that

Now(859,6)game(701,8)risen to leew(108,8)an(1011,6)other thre(912,9)boats(570,6)soon followed him, had considerab(649,7)start(933,7)

harnes(206,6)y left a(121,6), wide wake, as though continually unrolling

Full(925,6)is rapid(95,8)nd(162,6)fathoms(962,8)rear, swam a huge,
humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as(974,6)as

not customary for such venerabl(850,11)s to be at all social.
Nevertheless(940,6)tuck(142,7)ir(510,7)(507,7)indeed(617,7)back water

muzzle was a dashed one, lik(67,6)(53,6)formed when two hostile
currents meet. His spout was short, slow(621,6)laborious; coming forth

“Who’s got(672,6)paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has(952,6)tomach-ache, I’m
afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of(64,13)! Adverse

As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast (596,7)deck
load of frightened horses, careens,(486,6)s, rolls(687,6)wallows on her
way; so did this old(218,7)heave his aged bulk(754,6)now and then partly
turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expo(967,7)(977,6)of his devious
wake i(253,6)unnatural stump(43,8)starboard fin. Whether he had lost
that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.

“Only wait a bit, old chap(1018,6)I’ll give ye a sl(1021,7) that wounded
arm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to(885,6)hale-line near him.

“Mind he don’t(101,7)thee(525,6)it(93,9)Starbuck. “Give way, or the

Derick’s boat still le(250,6)chase, though every moment(302,6)d by his
foreign(455,6)s. The(411,6)th(584,7)y feared, was,(699,6)from being
already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron
b(490,9)y could completely overtake and pass him. As for (259,6), he
seemed quite confident(874,6)this(137,10)the case(932,6)occasionally
with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at(614,11)boats.

“The ungracious and(15,6)teful dog!(912,16); “he mocks and
dares m(961,7)the very poor-box I fill(867,7)him not five minutes
ago!”—then in his old(963,6)se whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to

“I tell ye what it is, men”—(198,8)ubb(503,8)crew—“it’s against my

At this moment Derick was(743,8)act of pitching his lamp-feeder(692,6)e
adv(581,7)boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of
retard(104,8)rivals’ way(81,7)t(717,6)ame time economically

for the honor of old Gayhead?(115,14)?”

“I say,(754,6)like god-dam,”—(257,6)the Indian.

Fiercely, but evenly incited(384,8)taunt(373,9)German, the Pequod’s
(777,6)boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
(483,8)ily neared him. In(980,6)fine, loose, chivalrous attitude(530,7)
headsman when drawing near t(719,6)prey(189,6)(957,6)mates stood up
proudly, occasionally backing(853,6)fter oar(104,6)ith an exhila(704,6)
cry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah (474,8)white-ash breeze! Down
(872,9)(1020,6)! Sail over him!”

But so decided an original start had Derick had,(332,6)spite of all
their gallantry, he would have prov(563,7)victor in this race, had not
a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the
bla(456,6)his midship(359,8). While(122,6)clumsy lubber was striving to
free his(342,10), and while, in consequence,(286,7)’s boat was nigh
to capsizing(64,6)he thundering away at(172,6)en(216,6)mighty rage;—that
was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb(158,6)Flask. With a shout, they took
a mort(471,9)forwards(218,6)slantingly ranged up on(941,11)’s
quarter. An instant more(285,6)all four(962,7)were diagonically(502,6)e
whale’s immediate wake,(349,6) stretching from them, on both s(769,6)was
the foaming swell(997,6)he made.

I(395,6)a terrific, most pitiabl(182,7)maddening sight. The whale was
now going head out(304,7)ending his spout before(673,11)ontinual
tormented jet;(232,7)his one poor fin be(523,7)side in an agony of

(451,6) sea, or sideways rolled towards(36,6)ky(229,9)beating fin. So
have I seen a bird with clipped wing making af(253,6)ed(155,6)n circles(141,8)air, vainly(965,12) escape the piratical hawks. But the bird
has a voic(714,7)with plaintive cries will make known her fear; b(77,6)
fear of(414,6)vast dumb brute(24,6)(314,7)was chain(871,6)and enchanted
in him; he had no(154,8)save(740,6)choking res(218,6)on through his
spirac(738,8)this mad(267,6)sight of him unspeakably(791,9)(673,7)
still,(586,8)amazing bulk, portcullis jaw(1023,6)omnipotent tail, there
was enough to appal(579,6)toutest man who so pitied.

Seeing(732,6)hat but a very few moments more would giv(491,6)Pequod’s
boat(650,6)advantag(1010,7)rather than be thus foiled(279,6)s game, Derick
chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long
dart, er(653,6)last chanc(189,8)for ever(691,7).

But no sooner did (1010,6)rpooneer stand up for(336,7)(952,6)than all
three tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively spra(831,6)their
feet(789,6)standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed(67,7)barbs; and darted ove(181,6)head(794,8)German(228,11),(131,6) three
Nantucket irons enter(100,6) whale. Bli(162,6)vapors of foam and
white-fire! The(85,6) boats, in the first fury(942,8)whale’s headlong
rush, bump(123,7)(182,6)’s aside with such forc(399,6)t both(591,7) and
his baffled(468,12)were spilled ou(376,8)a(667,6)ver by t(189,8)
flying keels.

“Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing
glance upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all
right—I saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve
distressed travellers. Hurrah! this i(986,6)way to sail now. Every keel
a sunbeam!(59,8)—Here we go lik(517,8)tin kettles at(353,6)ail of a

whale carri(269,7)everl(661,7)mail!”

Bu(402,6)monster’s run was a brief one. Giv(715,6)sudden gasp, he
tumultuously sounded. With a grating (982,6)(858,9) lines flew round
the loggerheads(999,11)a(1001,6) as to gouge deep grooves i(843,6);
while so fearful(1007,6)the harpooneers(482,6)this rapid(179,6)ing would
soon exhaus(682,6)lines,(537,6)using all their dexterous might, they
caught repeated smoking turn(218,7)the rope to hold on; till at
last—ow(751,7)the perpendicular strain from(162,6)ead-(519,6)chocks of
the boat(747,7)c(265,6)(912,6)ropes went(76,6)ght(602,6)in(113,7)blue—the
gunwales of(25,6)ows(344,6)almost even(212,10)water, (394,6)(495,9)
sterns tilted high(438,7) air. A(875,6) (689,6)soon ceas(1008,7)sound, for
some time they remained(515,6)at attitude,(515,9)of expe(482,6)more

(28,6)called;(662,6)ho(558,6)up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from(494,6)ack(68,7)(115,8)at often torments the Leviatha(496,7)soon rising
again to mee(767,6)(125,6)lance(125,8)foes. Yet not to speak(546,7)
peril(559,8)thing,(259,8)o be doubted whether(907,6)course is always(703,6)est; for(323,7)but reasonable to presume(926,7)the longer the
stricken(599,8)tays under(679,8)the more he is(1014,8)ed. Because,
(903,13)enormous surfa(273,8)m—in a full grown sperm(718,6)
something less than 2000 square feet—the pressure(874,8)water is
immense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we
ourselves stand up(261,6);(955,6)here, above-gr(875,6)(924,10); how
vast, then(308,6)burden of a(948,6), bear(729,6) his back a column of two
hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal(263,6)(201,6)of fifty
(229,9)es. One(478,6)man has estimated it (531,7)(66,10)twenty
line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and store(12,7)men on
board.

A(849,6)three boats lay there on(898,6)gently rolling sea, gazing down
into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any
sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;
what landsman would have thought(874,7)benea(303,9)at silence and
placidity(865,6)utmost monster(734,8)seas was wri(799,6)and wrenching in
agony! Not (717,6)inches of perpendicular rope were visible(506,8)bows.
Seems it credible(196,7)y(440,7)such thin thread(468,6)great Leviathan
was suspended like(779,6)ig(876,8)to an(171,7)day clock. S(53,8)? and
to what? To(568,8)its of (597,6) Is thi(601,6)creature of whom it was
once so triumphantly said—“Canst thou fill his skin(736,6)barbed irons?
or his head(767,6)fish-spears? The sword of him(718,6)layeth at him
cannot hold(494,6)spear(505,6)dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron
as straw; the arrow (91,7)make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;
he laugh(162,7)the shaking of a(158,6)!” T(353,16)?(372,6)he? Oh!
that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For(351,6)the strength of
a thousand thighs in his tail,(606,10) had ru(28,6)head under the
mountains(827,11), to hid(282,7)rom the Pequod’s(456,12)!

In(933,7)loping afternoon sunli(983,7)e shadows(995,6)the(672,8)oats
sent down(1021,9)the surface, must have been long enough and broad
(17,7)to shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the
wounded whale(120,16)such huge phantoms flitting ove(752,10)!

“Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, a(911,6)(944,6)lines suddenly
vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards(204,7)m, as by
magnetic wires(842,6)life and d(366,7)rob(516,9)whale, so(917,6)every
oarsman felt them(622,8)seat. The next moment, reliev(186,6)great part
(591,9)downward strain(850,8)bow(163,7)boats gave a(273,7) bounce
(233,7), as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
scared(739,6)it in(518,6) sea.

“Haul in! (9,8)(444,16) again; “he’s rising.”

Th(457,7),(118,7)ch, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth
could(759,11)gained, were now i(779,7)quick coils flung back all
dripping(220,10)boats, and soo(598,7)hale brok(610,7) within two

His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land
animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many(686,7)ir veins,
whereby(507,6)(969,7)(587,7)lood is in some degree at least(402,8)ly
shut off in(135,9)directions. Not so with(812,10); one(609,6)ose
peculiarities it is to(458,6)an entire non-valvular structure(900,7)
blood-vessels(908,10)when pierced even by so(772,7)a point as a
harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upo(970,6)whole arterial
system; and(847,6)this is heightened by the extraordinary press(204,6)
(591,6)at a great dista(125,6)low(879,6)urface, his life may be said to
pour(934,6)him in incessant streams. Yet so vas(368,6)he quantity of(336,6) in him(766,8)(140,7)t and numerous its interior fountains, that
he will keep thus bleeding and(13,10)for a considerable period; even
as in a drought a river(93,6)flow,(588,6) source(700,7)the well-springs
of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even n(82,6)e(1008,6)boats pulled

lances were darted into(367,6)they(27,6)follow(569,6)steady jets(477,6)the
new made(961,6), which kept continually playing, while the natural
spout-hole(495,6)s head was only at(479,6)vals, however rapid, sending
its affrighted moisture(212,6)the air. F(182,6)is last vent no (620,6)yet
came, because no vital part of him had(585,6)far been struck. H(782,7),
as(323,6)significantly call it, was untouched.

A(767,6)(486,6)now more closely surrounded(413,9)(1018,7)upper(157,8)
his form, with much of it that is (1009,7)ily submerged(142,6)plainly
revealed(205,6)eyes, or rather the places where h(37,7) had been, were
beheld. As strange misgrown masses g(83,6)(805,7)kno(515,6)s of(600,6)oblest oaks(777,6)prostrate, so(641,9) points(632,7)(284,6)ale’(190,6)
had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.
But pity there was none. For all his old ag(914,7)his one arm(17,9)
(110,6)(344,6)he must di(784,6)death and be murdered, in order to light
the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men(1011,6)also to illuminate
the solemn churches(554,6)preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to
all. Still rolling(968,8)blood, at(879,6)he partially disclosed a
(548,7)(22,7)oloured bunch or protuberance(767,6)size of a bushel, low
down o(593,6)flank.

“A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him(482,7)once.”

“Avast!(59,8)Starbuck, “there’s no need(697,6)at!”

But humane(49,9) was too late. At the instant(757,7) dart an
ulcerous jet shot(751,8)is cruel wound(617,6)goaded by it into more
than sufferable anguish(321,6)whale now spouting thick(435,8)with swift

crews all over(97,7)howers of gore, capsizing(419,6)’s boat and marring
the bows. It was his(827,7)strok(915,6), by(303,6)time, so spen(50,7)e
by loss of(677,8)that he helplessly rolled away(384,8)e wreck he had
made; lay panting o(762,6)side, impotently flapped(345,6)his stumped fin,
then(280,6)and(289,6)slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the
white secrets of(900,6)elly(164,6)(67,7)log(569,6)died(327,9)most

Soon, while(736,7)ews were awai(807,7)e arrival(950,8)ship(855,6)body
showed symptoms of sinking(855,6)all its treasures unrifled.
Immediately, by Starbuck’s orders, line(149,7)secured to it at
different points, so(730,6)ere(255,6)every(855,6)was a buoy;(344,6)unken

It so chanced(831,6)almost upon first cutting into him(757,6)(723,6)ade,
the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his
flesh, o(360,6)lower par(747,9)bunch before described. But as the
stumps of(111,8)s are frequentl(954,6)d i(460,6)dead bodies of captured(583,6)s,(228,10)flesh perfectly healed around them(482,6)no prominence

been some other unknown reason(201,8)present case fully to account for
the ulceration alluded to(320,6)still more curious(719,6)he fact of a

when? It might have been(54,8)by(312,6)Nor’ West Indian long(583,7)

However, Starbuck, w(424,7)the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to

“Hold on, h(9,8)won’t ye?” cried Stubb(112,8)body, “don’t be in

Now, this occasional inevitabl(733,10)of(141,7)cently killed Sperm

broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished(781,6)ll(38,6)

this(446,9)is caused by an uncommon specific gravity i(659,6)fish so
(511,7), consequent upon(563,6)absence of (382,6)t matter in him(787,6)it

Be it said, however,(578,8)e(710,13)is far less liable to this
accident than any other(434,6)es. Where one(924,6)at sort go down, twenty

It was not long(571,11)(186,7)(906,6)(128,7)that a cry was heard from

now in valiant chase(936,9)unnea(267,6)brute. The Virgin crowding all

have shed distinction upon it, I am transport(199,8)the reflection
that I myself(1015,7), though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a
fraternity(432,7)gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman(318,6)to

rarely achiev(561,6)the best(125,9)ers of the present day; inasmuch as

boldly up to(590,8).

Let not the modern painting(374,7)is scene mislead us(646,6)though the
creature (308,12)by(909,6)valiant(705,6)man of old is vaguely
represented of a griffin-like shape(617,6)(116,10)(354,7) is depicted

of those times, when the true form(773,9)hale was unknown to artists;
and(108,15)at as in(464,8)’ case,(635,11)’(968,7) might have
crawled up out(866,11) o(152,6)beach; (112,21)the animal

CHAPTER 83.(118,6) Historically Regarded.

Reference was made(345,8)h(50,9) story of(76,7)an(349,6)whale in
the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrus(395,6)
(109,39). B(850,6)n(721,6)(622,6)some
scep(681,6)Greeks and Roman(870,6), sta(582,6)out from the orthodox pagans
(679,6)ir times, equally doubt(598,8)(272,8)(476,8)(275,14),
and Arion(300,9)dolphin; and yet(101,7)doubt(952,6)ose traditions did
not make(30,18)one whi(865,6)less facts, for all that.

One old Sag-Harbor(577,13)hief reason for question(146,6)e Hebrew
(512,6)was this:—He had one(982,6)ose quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
embellished with curious, unscientific plates;(89,8)which represented
Jonah’s(634,7)with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only tru(52,6)
respect to a species(202,6)e Leviathan (the Right Whale(954,6)the
variet(53,9)at order), concerning(190,7)the fishermen have(753,6)saying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small.
But,(944,6)is, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not
necessary, hints the(75,7),(221,6)we consider(917,8)s tombed in the
whale’s belly, but as temporarily lodg(48,6)some part of his mouth. And
this seems(663,7)able enough(108,7) good(236,7). For truly, (431,9)
W(142,7)mouth(341,7)accommodate a coupl(613,8)st-tables, and
comfortably seat(848,7)e players. Possibly, too,(276,7)might have
ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts(200,17) is(51,6)less.

Another(951,8)(805,6)(992,11)(he went by(668,6)name) urged for his
want of fait(345,7)is matter(778,8)prophet, was something obscurely in
reference to his incarcerated body(821,8)(948,6)’s gastric juices. But(503,6)objection likewise falls(737,6)e ground, because a German exegetist
supposes(917,6)(408,7)us(407,6) taken refuge(589,8)floating(172,6)of a
_dead_(176,6)—even a(789,6)French soldiers(656,8)Russian campaign turned
their dead horses into tent(618,6) crawled(24,7)hem. Besides, it has
been divined by (508,6)continental commentators(945,8)hen(938,7)was
thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his
escape to a(638,7)vessel near by,(981,6)(21,7)with a(497,6) for a
figure-head; and, I(920,8)dd, p(849,7) called “The Whale,” (638,7)
craft are nowadays christene(611,6)“Shark,”(13,6)Gull(12,8)Eagle.” Nor
(524,6)here been wanting learned(591,10)s who(571,6)opi(101,6)at the
(220,6)mentioned(590,8)book of(634,8)erely meant a life-preserver—an
infl(809,6)ag of wind—(977,6)the endangered(908,8) swam to(575,6)so was
save(468,7)a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor,(246,6)fore, seems worsted all
round. But he had still(499,9)reason for his want of faith. It(620,7)is, if I remember right:(657,10) swallow(722,6)the(555,7)(915,6)
Mediterranean Sea(813,6)after three days he was vomited up somewhere
within(46,11)’ journey of Nineveh, a city o(969,6)Tigris, very much
more tha(74,22)across(846,10)nearest poi(283,6)(206,18)coast. How is that?

But was(660,7)no(997,7)way for(289,11)to lan(748,6)(530,8)(234,6)
that short distance(234,11)? Yes. He might(724,6)carried him round by
the way(190,7) Cape of Good Hope(544,6)not to speak(43,8)passage
throug(706,6)whole length(83,8)(479,13)(475,7)(610,7)(67,7) up
the Persian Gulf and Red(528,6)such a supposition would invol(991,6)
complete circumnavigation of all Africa(956,6)(598,8),(220,16)
(538,10)(861,6)s, nea(407,6)sit(359,12), being too shallow for any
(450,9)swim in. Besides, this idea of(806,6)’s weathering(393,12)
(393,9) at so early a day(259,7)wrest the honor(458,8)discovery(212,6)at great headland(711,6)Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed(68,9)er, and
so make modern history a liar.(729,6)all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
(53,8)pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing(800,6)he had but little learning except w(39,11)picked up(994,9)
sun (897,8)sea. I say it(185,6)shows his(236,8), impious(192,6)(310,6)abominable, devilish rebellion again(450,7)reverend clergy. For by a
Portuguese Catholic priest(592,7)very(597,17)go(671,6)(689,8)
via(1000,22) was advanced as a signal magnific(843,9)the
general miracle. And so it was(748,12)o(751,6)day,(677,6)ighly
enlightened Turks devoutly believe(936,6)e(614,7)ical (623,6)(821,8).

Voyages,(1024,6)s of a Turkish Mosque built in(865,10)Jonah, in which

CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.

T(878,7)them run easily and swiftl(339,7)axles of carriages are
anointed; and for much(716,6)ame purpose,(323,6)whalers perform an
analogous oper(512,6)upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it
to be doubted(270,6)as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly
be of no contemptible(691,6)tage; considering(372,6)oil and water are
hostile;(32,10)is a slid(54,6)ing,(1010,7)a(915,6)object in view is to
(408,8) boat slide bravely. Queequeg(713,8)d strongly in (406,6)ing
his boat(113,6)one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau
disappeared, took more than customary pains(846,6)at occupation;
crawling under its(447,7), where it hung ov(135,7)side(289,6)rubbing in
the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair
from the craft’s bald keel. He seemed (590,6)work(126,6) obedience to
some particular presentiment(660,6)did it remain unwarranted by the
event.

Towards noon(798,6)s were raised; but so soon(242,6)e(415,6)sailed down to
them,(807,6)turned(911,6)led with(971,6) precipitancy; a disordered
flight, as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.

Nevertheless,(677,9)s pursued(735,6)Stubb’s was foremost. B(970,6)t
exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron(278,6)the
stricke(315,7), without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal(254,9)with added fleetness. Such unintermitt(877,6)ainings upon the
pl(483,6)iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became
imperative to lance the flying(230,8)or be content to lose him. But to
haul(406,9) up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and
furious. What then(718,7)ed?

Of al(98,6)wondrous devices and dexteritie(542,7)sleights(904,6)nd and
countless subtle(47,7)o which the vetera(795,7)man is so often forced,
none exceed that fine manœuvre(769,6)the(336,7)called pitchpoling. Small
sword(351,6)road (16,7)in all its exercises boasts nothing like(460,7)
is only indispensabl(134,7)an in(212,6)te runn(471,9); its grand fact
and feature i(1018,6)wonderful dist(542,6)(302,12)long(566,7)is

headway. Steel and wood included(1024,6)entire spear(422,6)me ten or
twelve feet in length;(537,6)taff is much slighter than(460,6)of the
harpoon, and also of a (48,8)material—pine. It is furnished(984,7)
small rop(518,9)a warp, of considerable(163,7), by(653,7)it can be
hauled back to the(722,7)fter darting.

But before going further, it i(898,6)rta(962,6)mention here,(709,6)though
(96,6)rpoon may be(699,9)ed in(863,6)ame way(748,15), yet(111,6)
seldom done;(452,6)hen done, is still less frequ(544,6)successful, on
accoun(404,8) greater weight and inferior(484,7)(42,8)(193,8)as
compar(404,8)(171,11)(360,7)n effect become serious drawbacks. As a
general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a(876,6),(409,7)
any(334,9)ing comes into play.

Look now at Stubb; a man who(848,6)his humorous, delib(991,6)coolness and
equanimity(436,8)direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel
in(176,12). Look at him; (847,6)nds upright(543,8)tossed bow(847,8)fly(1007,8); wrapt in fleecy foam(981,6)towing(309,6) is forty feet
ahead. Handling(629,6)ong(634,6)(921,6)ly, glancing twice or thrice along
its(556,8)to see if it be exactly straight,(385,6) whistlingly gathers
up the coil(670,8)warp in on(929,6), so as(103,6)cure its free end in
his grasp, leav(214,8)rest unobstructed. Then hold(250,9)ance full
(1012,7)his waistband’s middle, he levels it at(171,6)hale; when,
covering him(976,6)it,(476,6)eadily depresses the butt-(194,6)(652,6)and,
thereby elevat(417,8)point till(291,6)eapon(565,8)fairly balanced upo(276,6)palm, fifteen fee(601,9)air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,
(85,6)ing a(550,6)staff o(179,6)chin. Next moment(248,6)a rapid, nameless
impulse, in a superb lofty arch(272,6)(763,6)steel span(295,6)foaming
distance, and quivers(916,8)life spot(581,9)hale. Instead of
sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.

“That drove the spigot out of him!” cried(729,6). “’Tis July’s immortal
Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old
Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,

Again and aga(198,6)such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeate(888,6) spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful
leash. The agonized(648,6) goes into his flurry; the tow-line is

CHAPTER 85(171,6)F(666,7).

That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages
before—the great(909,6)s shoul(638,7)been(891,6)ing all over(878,6)ea(204,6)sprin(947,6)and mistifying the garde(118,6)(476,6)ep, as with so many(67,12)or(66,12)pots;(359,7)(245,8)ome centuries back,
(262,8)s of hunter(201,19)close by the(1003,9)(154,7)
whale,(403,6)(189,7)se (221,10)s and(268,9)s—that all thi(309,8)
b(802,7)yet,(802,6)dow(947,7)is blessed minute (fiftee(791,7) quarter
(30,6)s past one o’clock P.M.(329,6)is sixteenth day of December, A.D.
1851), it(465,8)still remain a problem, wheth(469,6)se(225,10) are,
after all, real(692,6)er, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a
noteworthy thing.

Let us, then, look at(325,6)matter, along(546,8)me interesting items
contingent. Every(754,11)that(485,8)peculiar cunning(647,7)ir
gill(134,6) finny tribes in general breathe the air which (502,8)imes
is combined(722,6)the element in(51,7)they swim; hence, a herr(752,7)a
cod might live a(736,7)y(589,6)never once raise its head above the
surface. But owing to (341,6)rked(324,6)nal structure(208,7)gives him
regular lungs, like a human being’(305,7)whale can only(180,6)by
inhal(1016,8)disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefor(198,6)necessity for his periodical visits(844,6)e upper world(245,6)he cannot
in any degree(454,11)rough(276,6)outh, for, in his ordinary attitude,
the Sperm Whale’(56,7) is buried at least eight feet benea(522,6)(406,8); and what is(904,7)more, his windpipe has no connexion(770,6)his
mouth. No, h(210,9)s(211,13)spiracle alon(114,7)(911,8)on the
top of hi(574,6).

If I say,(821,6)(313,7)creatur(315,8)ing(69,6)ly a function
indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from(847,9)a
certain(817,8),(866,7)being subsequently brought into contac(88,6) the
blood impar(545,10)(21,7)ts vivifying principle, I do not think I
shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.
Assume it(957,6)it follows(356,7)f all(162,12)n a man could be
aerated(511,6)on(707,8), he might then seal up his nostrils and not
fetch another for a consider(433,6)ime. T(660,7)to(519,6)he would then
live without(525,10). Anomalous(481,7)may seem,(626,9)precisely the
cas(72,6) the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals(803,6)full
hour and more (when at(492,6)ottom)(172,9)drawing a singl(322,10)or
so (668,9)(752,6)way inhal(51,6)particle of air; for, remember, he has
no gills. How is this? Between his rib(402,6)on each side(899,8)spine
he is suppli(499,8)a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of
vermicelli-like vessels(841,8)(15,11)en he quits the surface, are
completely distend(638,9)xygenated(848,6). So(712,6)for an hour or
more, a thousand fathoms in(112,6)ea, he carries a surplus stock of
vitality in him, just a(176,6)camel crossing(584,6)aterless desert
(92,19)upply of drink for future use in its four
supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of(745,6)(396,10)is
indisputable; and(1008,6)(365,6)pposition founded upon it is reasonable
and true, seem(427,6)more cogent to me(464,7)I(977,9) the otherwise
inexplicable obstinacy(182,6)at leviathan in _having(658,7)outings out_,
(379,7)fishermen phrase it. T(1001,7)what I mean. If unmolested, upon
ri(433,6)o(631,14)the Sperm Whale will continue there(611,6) period
of time exactly uniform(818,7)ll his(260,6)(132,11) (126,6)s. Say he
stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times,(745,6)is, respire(33,9)
breaths; then whenever he rises again, h(217,7)be sure to have his
(108,8)(75,7) over(56,8)to a(159,7). Now, if aft(99,6)fetches a few(139,8) you alarm(829,6)s(936,7)he sounds(142,13)always dodging up
again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those(211,17)are told,(479,6)he finally go down to stay out his full
term below. Remark, however(404,8)n different individuals these rates
are(38,10); but in any one they are alik(358,8)why should the whale
thus insist(950,6)(819,24), unless it be to replenish
(332,6)servoir(324,7), ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,
that this necessity for(174,10)’s(756,7) exposes him to all(974,6)atal
hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net c(276,7)is vast
leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the
sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great
(253,8)ies(933,6)strike the victory to thee!

In man,(874,7)ing is incessantly going on—one(912,7) only serv(409,7)
two or three pulsations;(874,9)whatever other business he has to
attend to, waking or sleeping(160,8)e he must, or die(952,8). But the
Sperm Whale(168,6)(58,7)s about one (908,6)h or Sunday of his time.

It has be(436,6)d(857,6)(758,9)(88,15)through(756,10)-hole;
if i(542,9)ruthfully be adde(85,7)(809,9)s are mixed with water,
then I opine we(899,8)be furnish(48,8)the reason why(898,6)ense of
smell seems obliterated in him;(807,9)only (519,6)(302,6)him(581,6)at

of smelling(504,6)owing(725,7) mystery(959,8)spout—whether it be(347,6)
or (23,14)vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at
on(1019,6)head. Sure it is, nevertheless,(579,10)(673,12)has no
proper olfactories(720,6)what does he want(213,7)m? No roses, no
violets, no Cologne-water in(261,6)ea.

Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens in(333,7)tube(797,8)spouting
canal, and a(508,7)long canal—lik(429,6)grand Erie Canal—is(692,10)
with a sort of locks (that open and shut)(669,9)downward retention of
air (702,7)upward exclus(31,6)(838,7) therefor(583,6)(966,6)(381,6) voice;
unless you insul(764,6)by saying(449,7)when he so strangely rumbles, he
talks through(804,9)(679,6)then again,(475,6)has(144,11)to say?
Seldom(757,6)I known any profou(847,9)t(66,6)d any(947,6)(65,6)(776,6)is

living. Oh! happy(710,10)world is such an excellent listener!

Now,(902,10)i(548,8)(924,8)(779,11), chiefly intended as(842,6)
(513,8)conveyance of air(644,6)for several feet laid along,

in a city on(81,9) of a street(553,9) question returns whether
this(92,10)is also a(746,6)-pipe; in other words,(60,8)(395,10)

discharged(823,9)(562,6)iracle. It is certain(642,10)mouth
indirectly communicates(124,6)(634,18); but it cannot be
proved(730,8)is is (626,8)purpose of (167,8)ing(212,8)(174,10)
(174,10)Because the greatest necessity(685,6)o doing would seem to be,
wh(295,6)feeding he accide(706,6) takes in(494,6)(558,10)(842,11)’s

rhyme between(409,6)eriods(946,8)jets(213,8) ordinary(37,11)

But why pester one(684,6)all(989,6)reasoning o(112,6)subject? Speak out!
You have seen him(859,6); then declare w(688,8)(352,6)is; can you not
tell(804,7)from air? My dear sir, in(663,6)world it is not so easy to
settle these pl(807,6)ings. I(163,6)ever found your(37,13) the
knottiest of all. And a(779,8)is whal(847,7)(462,6)might almost stand
in it(607,6)yet be undecided as to(271,6)(197,6)precisely.

The central body of(235,7)hidd(788,6)the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
it; and how(359,9)certainly (365,6)hether any(377,8)alls(383,6)it(900,6), always,(677,6)you are(748,6) en(1016,6)o a(278,7)to get a(33,7)view
(667,7)(305,7)he is in a prodigious commotion, the(520,7)cascading all
around him(403,6)if at such times you should think(860,6)(938,6)ally
perceived drops of moisture(343,9)(165,7)ow do you know(934,6)they are
not merely condensed(310,8)s vapor; or(70,35)those identical(152,7)superficially lodged(161,13)-hole
fissure, which is countersunk into(946,7)mmit of(346,6)hale’s head? For
even(477,6)tranquilly swimming thr(484,6)he mid-day sea(449,6)calm, with
his elevated hump sun-dri(753,6)a dromedary’s(708,8)desert; even then,
(163,9)(631,7) carries a small basin of(690,7)on hi(206,6), as under a
blazing su(763,6)will some(555,6)see a cavity(652,6)rock filled up(212,6)rain.

Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touch(327,6)e
(999,7) nature(401,13)(797,6). It(170,6)not do for him(90,7)peering
into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to
this fountain and fill(90,9)bring it away. For(425,6)when coming into
slight contact(108,6)the outer,(784,6)y shreds(647,8)jet(696,8)will
often happen,(170,6)skin(440,6)feverishly smart,(877,6)the acridness of
the thing so(379,10)it. And I(971,6)one, who(195,12) still closer
(201,17)spout, whether(333,6)some scientific object in view, or
otherwise, I(396,8)say,(968,6)kin peeled off(210,6)his cheek and arm.
Wherefore, among(961,6)men(71,7)pout is deemed poisonous; they try to
evade(266,7)other(296,6); I have heard it said(601,6)I do not much doubt
it, that i(454,9) is fairly(708,6)ed(338,6)your eyes, i(725,7)blind
you. The wisest(433,7)the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is
to let this dead(128,8) alone.

Still, we can hypothesize,(711,6)if(28,7)not prove and establish. My
(55,9)s is this:(257,6)(380,13)no(630,6)but mis(624,7)besides(519,6) reasons, to(181,6)conclusion I am impelled, by considerations
(716,9)the great inherent dignity and sublimity(871,8)Sperm Whale; I
account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed
fact(519,6)he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other
whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound(970,8)am
convinced(658,6)from the heads of all(70,11)(66,8)(229,6)s, s(226,6)
Plato, Pyrrho(924,6)Devil, Jupiter, Dante(790,6)so o(891,6)re always goes
up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act(419,6)inking deep
thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the
curiosity to place a mirror before me;(745,6)re long saw reflected
there, a curious involved worming and undulation(210,9)tmosphere over
my head(1003,6)invariable moisture of my hair(284,8)plunged in(272,13), after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an
August noon;(888,6)seems an additional argument for(416,6)bove
supposition.

And how nobly it raises our concei(468,7)e mighty, misty monster, to
behold him solemnly sail(989,6)rough a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
contemp(457,6)s(737,6)that(65,6)—as you will(937,11)see it—glorified
by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his (755,9)

vapor. And so,(340,10)ll the thick mists(429,8)dim doubts(591,6)

heavenly ray(143,6)(604,6)is I thank God; for all have(135,7); many deny;

CHAPTER 86. The Tail.

Other poets(299,6)warbled the p(906,8)(894,6)soft eye(910,8)antelope,
(446,7) lovely plumag(40,9)bir(768,7)never alights; less celestial,
I celebrate a t(162,6)Reckon(968,6)e largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at(884,6)point
(660,7)trunk where it tapers to abou(776,6)girth of(352,6), it comprises
upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.
The compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat
palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to(361,6)than an inch in
thickness. A(251,6)crotch or junction, these(100,7) slightly overlap,
(948,6)ideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy
between. In no liv(498,6)ing are(606,6)in(653,6)beauty more exquisitely
defined(234,6)in(212,7)escentic border(719,8)(214,9). At(468,6)tmost
expansio(67,9)full grown whale,(587,6)ail will considerably exceed
twenty feet across.

The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
into it, and you fin(863,7)three distinct strata compose it:—upper,
middle(67,6)lower. The fibres(314,8)(739,6)(35,9) layers, are long
and horizontal; thos(1013,9)(99,6) one, very shor(182,7)running
crosswise (511,7) the outside(112,7). This triune structure, as much as
any(554,6)else, imparts power to(431,9). T(13,6)student of old Roman
walls(476,6)(189,7)layer(484,6)furnish a curious parallel(97,9)hin
cour(260,7)iles always alternating with(133,7)one(679,6)ose wonderful
relic(679,8) antiqu(429,7)which undoubtedly contribute so(274,6)(242,6)
great strength(408,9)asonry.

But as if this vast local(313,7)(833,7)tendinous(754,7)ere not enough,
the whole bulk(511,8)levia(904,6)s knit over(253,6)a warp(208,6)oof of
muscular(643,8)and filaments,(247,7)passing on either side(111,6)oins
(604,11) down in(510,7)(1002,6), insensibly blend(398,9)m, and
large(342,14)(576,6)ir might; so(877,6)(287,8)ail the confluent
measureless forc(788,9)(295,6)whale(1018,7)concentrated to a point.
Could annihilation occur to matter,(439,6)wer(259,6)(770,6)to do it.

Nor does this—its amazing(532,9), at all tend to crippl(339,6)graceful
flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a
Titanism of(923,6). O(1010,6)contrary,(779,7)(99,7) derive(383,8)ost
appalling beauty from it. Real(749,10)never impairs(44,8)or
harmony, but it often bestows it; and in every(339,6)imposingly
beautiful,(856,10)has(887,9)do(991,10)magic. Take away(845,6)ied
tendons(583,6)all(795,6)seem bursting(216,6)(944,6)rble(909,8)carved
Hercules,(175,6)ts charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the
linen sheet(111,10)naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelme(827,6)
(234,6)ssive chest(748,8)man,(809,6)seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.
When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what
robustness is there. And whatever they may reveal(913,8)divine love in
the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which
his idea has been most successfully embodied; these(71,11)so
destitute as(187,6)are of all brawniness, hint no(1019,6)of any(859,6), but(413,6)ere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance,(204,6) on
all hands it is conceded, for(677,6)peculiar prac(288,6)virtues of his
teachings.

Such(425,7) subtle elasticity(576,8)organ I treat of(589,7)whether
wielded in sport, or in earnes(15,9)anger,(520,10)be(924,6)ood it
be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein
no fairy’s arm can transcend it.

Five great mot(103,9)(311,9)to it. First, when us(820,8)fin for
progression; Second(44,17)mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;
Fourth, in lobtailing; Fif(22,7)peaking flukes.

First: Being horizontal in its positi(824,8)Leviathan’s tail acts in a
different manner fro(577,6)tails(738,8)other sea creatures. It never
wriggles. In man or fish, (26,6)ing is a sign of inferiority. To the
whale, hi(164,7)(654,8)ole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled
forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards,(844,6)
this(874,7)gives(741,6)singular darting, leaping(574,7) to(711,7)nster
when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.

(589,6): It(314,6)little significant(894,9)ile one sperm whale only
fights an(446,7)(32,11)with his head and jaw,(463,6)theless, in his
conflicts(54,6)man, he chiefly and contemptu(238,6)uses(457,9). In
striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his(743,7)(652,6)it(445,9)
blow i(311,7)i(151,6)ed by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed
air, especially if it descend(1019,6)s mark(832,6)stroke(658,7)n simply
irresistible. No ribs of(770,8)boat can withstand it. Your(416,6)salvation lies in eluding it; but(152,7)come(565,6)ways through the
opposing water,(738,6)partly owing(664,8)light buoyancy of(884,10)-(399,6)(801,7) elasticity of(265,7)terials, a cracked rib or a
dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch(390,8)side, is generally the
most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received
(490,7)fishery(800,7)they are accounted mere child’s play. Some one
strips off a frock(282,10)hole is stopped.

Third: I cannot demonstrate it,(452,6)t seems to me(950,7)(661,7)whale
the sense of touch is concentrated(709,8)tail; for(726,6)is respect
there is a delicacy in it(812,6)equall(811,10)daintiness(523,8)elephant’s trunk. This(77,11)s(1010,9)evinc(149,10)action of
sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness(249,10) with a certain soft
slowness moves his immense flukes from(525,6)to(533,6)upo(607,7)urface of(341,7)a; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe(812,6)at(30,7),
(29,7)s and all. What tender(204,8)(375,6)in(623,6)preliminary(459,6)!
Had(428,6)tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of
Darmonodes’ (429,8)(175,7)o frequente(964,6)flower-marke(987,7)with low
salutations pres(54,6)nosegays to damsels(761,9)n caress(93,6)ir
zones. On mo(858,10)s than one, a pity it is(904,9)(502,7)does not
poss(529,6)is(276,12)virtue in (310,8)(756,6)I have heard of yet
another(274,9)(1014,7)when wound(829,10)fight, curved round his
trunk and extrac(325,8)dart.

Fourth: Stealing unawares(631,10)(718,6)(103,8)ancied security(865,8)middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent(740,6)the vast corpulence
of his dignity(475,6)kitten-like, he plays (787,7)ocean as if it were a
hearth. But still you see his(661,6)(384,8)play. The broad palms (136,6)

CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.

The long(391,6)arrow peninsula of Malacca,(873,6)ding south-eastward from
the territories of Birmah, forms the(584,6)southerly point of all Asia.
In a continuous line from(928,6)(154,10)stretc(794,6)long islands of
Sumatra, Java, B(1020,7)nd Timor; which,(859,6)many others(171,6) a vast
mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia(934,6)Australia, and
dividing(164,10)unbroken Indian ocean(223,8)e thickly studded
oriental archipelagoes. This(150,8) is pierced by several sally-ports
for the convenience of ships and(842,6)s; conspicuous among(297,6) are
the straits of Sunda and(544,8). By (37,20), chiefly,
vessels bound to China(256,10)west, emerge into the(37,7)seas.

Those(680,8)(144,17)divide (512,7)(568,6)Java(842,6)standing

those domine(432,6)for(610,6)s(875,7)guard the entrances (776,6)

they freely waive a ceremonial (334,7)i(329,6)y do by no means renounce
their claim to more solid tribute.

Time out of mi(444,7)piratical proa(601,9)Malays, lurking amo(1000,6)

day, we occasionally hear of English and American (335,7)(747,7), in(1010,7)waters(724,7)been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.

With a fair, fresh(843,7)the Pequod was now drawing nigh to(1005,7)(453,7); Ahab purposing to pass(497,12)m in(56,6) Javan sea, and
thence,(376,6)ing northwards, over(224,7) known to be frequented here
a(742,6)re(528,8)Sperm Whale, sweep insho(34,10)Philippine I(1013,6),
and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season
there. By(562,6)(963,6)(591,6)circumnavigating(360,9)ould(168,7)almost
all the(247,7)(208,11)(298,10)grou(703,7)the world, previous to
desce(854,6)(919,8) Line (228,7)Pacific; where Ahab, t(858,6)everywhere
else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted(1022,6)giving battle to Moby
Dick(323,6)he sea he was most(478,10)(475,8); and at a(344,7) when he
might(54,6)reasonably b(860,6)umed(549,7)haunting it.

But how now?(255,6)is zoned quest, does(715,6)touch no land?(25,6)his
crew drink air? Surely, he will stop fo(691,7). Nay. For a long time,
now(526,11)s-running sun has raced with(364,7)fiery ring, and needs
no sustenance but what’s(418,6)mself. So Ahab. Mark this, too(391,8)

when three(72,6) afloat(577,6)(53,9)er(857,9)(979,7), prefers to

from(97,6)eruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, w(602,10)
ships may have gone to China from New York(745,6)back again,(916,6)ing at
a score of ports(847,6)(598,10), in all that interval, may not have
sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating
seamen like themselves. So(123,6)did you carry the(323,6)news that
an(884,6)flood had come; they would only answer—“Well, boys, here’s the
ark!”

Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captur(478,7)the western coast of
Java(590,9)near vicinity o(51,6)Straits of Sunda; indeed(124,6)o(71,6)the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as(670,7)quod gained more and
more upon Java Head(835,6)look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and
admonished to keep wide awake. But though (247,6)een palmy cliffs(314,7)
land soon loomed o(949,6)starboard bow(764,6)with del(678,7)nostril(495,6)fresh cinnamon was snuffed(440,8)air, yet not a single jet was
descried. Almost renouncing(823,7)ought of falling in(146,6)any game
hereabou(894,8)ship had well nigh entered(226,7)raits, when the
customary cheering cry was heard from aloft(274,6)ere long a spectacle
of singular magnificence saluted us.

But here be it premised,(934,6)owing to the unwearied activity with
which of late(928,6)have(854,6)hunted over all four ocean(286,7)Sperm
(909,6), instead of a(385,6)invariably sai(370,8)small detached
companies, as in former times, are now frequently met(585,6)in extensive
herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude(294,7)it would(179,7)
seem as if numerous nation(751,8)m had sworn solemn leagu(915,6)covenan(979,6)mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of
(349,9) Whale into such immense caravans, may be imput(663,6)
circum(115,7)that even(838,8)best cruising grounds, you may now
(325,10)sail for weeks and months together, without be(81,6)eeted by
(931,9)spout; and then be suddenly(723,9)by what(449,11)seems
thousands on (13,9).

Broad on both bows, at the d(368,8)of some two or three miles, and
forming a(545,7)semicircle,(576,11)one half(514,7) level horizon, a
continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and spark(787,8)the
noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin(95,6)(150,7)Right(910,6), which, dividing at top, fall(978,6)in two branches, (113,8)
cleft drooping boughs of a willow(1022,6)(476,7)forward-slanting(493,6)(710,20)presents a thick curled bush(306,6)ite mist, (338,7)ally
r(682,6)and falling away to leeward.

Seen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she(1008,7)rise on a high hill(890,8)sea,(919,6)host of vapory(711,6)s, individually curling up(935,6)the
air, and beheld through a blen(401,7)mosphere of bluish haze, showed
(513,9)(770,8) cheerful chimneys(736,9)dense metropolis, descried
of a balmy autumnal morning, by(800,6)horseman(274,7)eight.

As marching armies approa(19,7)n unfriendly defile(719,7) mountains,
accelerate their(84,6), all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
(61,6)rea(349,7)once more expand in comparative security upo(868,6)plain; even so did(488,6)vast fleet(954,9)s now seem hurrying(747,8)
(463,8)(926,9)ts; gra(530,8)ontracting the wing(934,8)ir
semicircle(548,6)swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.

Crow(989,6)ll sail(763,11) pressed after them; the harpooneers
handl(166,7)ir weapons(698,6)loudly(627,6)ing(859,10)head(206,10) yet
suspended boats. If(249,8)d only held, little doubt had they, that

(899,8) Oriental seas to wit(616,6)he captu(890,6)not a few(417,10)number. And who could tell whether,(742,6)at congregated caravan, Moby
Dick himself might not temporarily be(509,9), (1007,9)worshipped
white-elephant(859,8)coronation procession(608,7) Siamese! So with
stun-sail piled on (19,9), we sailed along, driv(697,7)se leviathans
before us; when, of a sudden(408,7)oice of Tashtego was heard,(592,7)
dire(794,6)attention to something in our wake.

Corresponding (475,7)(780,8)(44,8)van, we beheld another(74,7)
rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling
(159,10)(422,9)spou(666,6)the whales;(749,6)they did not so
completely come and go; for(44,6)constantly hovered, without finally
disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved
in his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to
wet(261,6)ails;—Malays, sir(57,6)after us!”

As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should
fairly have entere(58,6)straits,(686,7)rascally Asiatics were now in
hot pursuit, to make up(391,8)ir over-cautious delay. But when the

very kind(950,7)se tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on
to(10,6)wn chosen(223,9)—mere riding-(450,10)rowels (56,6), that
they were. As(210,6)(591,6)under arm(587,7)to-and-fro pac(385,7)deck; in

deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild(389,8)
(435,6)human atheistical devil(878,7)infernally cheering him on with
(875,6)curses;—when a(1013,6)se conceits had passed (329,8)his brain,
Ahab’s brow was left gaunt(744,6)ibbed, like (594,6)ack s(426,6)ach(625,6)
(581,6)tormy tide has been gnawing it(998,6)out(343,7)able to drag the
firm thing from its place.

But (537,7)s(142,9)se troubled very few(638,8)reckless crew; and
when,(802,7)steadily dropp(496,8)(13,9)the(816,9)astern, the
Pequod at last shot b(652,6)vivid(776,7)Cockatoo Point (804,7)Sumatra

gaining(957,10)ship, than to rejoic(70,12)hip had so
victoriously gained(185,10)Malays. But still driving on i(261,6)wake
(420,7)(153,6), at length they(213,8)abat(396,7)ir speed; gradually the
ship neared them(914,6)the wind now dying away, word was(784,9)o

keels(439,6)were(676,7)them,—(758,6) as yet a mile(333,7)ir rear,—than
they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that
(367,8)outs all looked(885,6)flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved
on with red(930,9)locity.

Stripped to our shirt(147,6)drawers, we spra(413,10)white-ash, and
(968,7)everal hours’ pulling(326,7)lmost dispo(495,6) renounce the

perplexity of inert irresolution, which(175,7)the fishermen perceive it
(871,8)(630,6)(848,6)ay he is g(542,6). The compact martial columns in
whic(909,7)had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming,(254,9)
broken up in one measureless rout(942,6)like King Porus’ elephants in
the Indian battle(598,6)Alexander(227,8)eemed going mad with
consternation. In all directions expand(797,7)vas(371,6)gular circles,
and aimless(233,11)(272,7) and t(284,6), by(919,7)short thick
spoutings(399,7)plainly betrayed(970,7)distraction of panic. This was
still more(563,8)ly evinced(120,6)os(598,7)eir number, who, completely
paralysed as it were, help(224,7)float(1007,8)water-logged dismantled

sheep, pursued ov(801,7)pasture(330,6)ree fierce wolve(322,8)could not
possibly have(271,9)such excessive(185,6)y. But this occasional
timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though
b(579,7)together in tens(995,6)ousand(508,6) lion-maned buffaloe(39,7)e
West(199,6)fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too,(158,6)uman
be(615,6)how when herded(154,14)he sheepfold of a theatre’s pit,
they will, at(482,6)lightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the
outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorse(866,7)dashing each
other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement(186,7)

(560,6) man(95,9)(142,6), as ha(817,7)said, were in violent motion,
yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in
those cas(923,7) boats at once separ(101,6)each making for some one lone
whale o(670,6)outskirt(794,8) shoal. In about three minutes’ time,
Queequeg’s harpoon was flung;(758,6)tricken fish darted bli(958,6)spray
in our faces(668,6)then running away with us like light, steered
straight(774,8) heart(589,8)herd. (519,7)such a mov(690,6)(254,7)part(623,8)(279,6)struck under(54,6)circumstances, is in no wise
unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;
yet does it pres(161,6)e(790,8)more perilous vicissitude(436,8)
fishery. For as(456,6)wift monster drags you deeper and(11,8)into(71,6)rantic(515,6), you bid adieu to(266,8)pect life and only exist in a
delirious throb.

As,(506,6)(117,7)af(703,6)(648,6)plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
speed to rid himself(986,8)iron leech(922,6)had fasten(51,6)him; as we
thus tore a white gash i(783,6)sea, on all sides menaced(62,6) flew, by
the crazed creatures to and fro rushing(837,7)us; our beset boat was
like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest(801,6)striving to(775,6)

moment it may be locked in and crushed.

But(57,6) bit daunted, Queequeg(922,8) us manfully; now(460,6)ing off

time, Starbuck stood up(532,8)bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our

time to make long ones. Nor(207,6)the oarsmen quite idle, th(519,10)
wonted duty(89,7)w altogether dispensed with. They chiefly att(303,6)to

calmly cooling himself(110,6)his own fan-like extremity.

All(540,6)boats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented
by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of
equal size are stoutly clenched (562,8), so(429,6)they (933,6)each
other’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then
atta(112,7) the middle(620,6)is block, and(766,6)ther end(653,8)line

must kill all(123,8). And if(139,8)no(36,7)them all(141,6)ce(68,11)wing them(520,16)an be afterwards killed at(883,6)leisure.
Hence it is,(1014,6)at times like these the(696,6), comes into
requisition. Our boat was furnished(998,6)thre(566,7)em. The first and
(1000,7)were successfully darted(607,6)we saw the(505,8)staggeringly

It had been next to im(1001,7)e to dart(746,7)drugged-harpoons,(665,6)it

pods of(594,7), eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and(10,6),
like multiplied spans of horses in a ring;(131,6)o closely shoulder to

density(336,8)crowd of repos(997,9)s,(540,6)immediately surrounding
the embayed axi(415,9)herd, no possible chance of escape was at(756,8) afforded us. We must watch for a breach(912,8)living wall that
hemmed us in;(738,6)(28,8) had only admitt(39,8) or(406,6) shut us

deceptive—spoutings(29,9) discovered from our low boat(958,6)seemed
playing up almost(48,6)the rim(787,9)orizon. I mention this
circumstance, because, as i(923,7)(579,14) had been purposely
locked up(799,6)is inner(140,6)old; and(83,11)wide extent(946,12)

stopping; or,(1023,8)y, being so young, unsophisticated(663,6)every way

whales—now and then(934,6)ing our becalmed(467,6)(437,9)margi(915,7)e
lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessnes(994,7)onfidence, or else a still
becharmed panic which it was im(295,7)e not to marvel at. Like
household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,
and touch(450,7)m; till it(697,8)(722,6)(734,7)ome spell had suddenly
dome(439,8) them. Queequeg pat(561,7)ir foreheads; Starbuck scratched
(36,6)backs with his lance; but fearful(831,8)consequences, for the
time refrain(936,8)darting it.

But far beneath(797,6)(452,9)world upon the surface, another and(449,7)stranger(51,7)met our eyes as we gazed over(76,6)ide. For, suspended
in those watery vaults, flo(334,8) forms(918,8)nursing mother(23,8)(730,7)(820,6)(81,6)that by(378,7)enormous girth(470,8)shortly to become

exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will
calmly and fixedly gaze away(915,10)breast, as if leading two
different lives at the time(134,6)(117,6)yet draw(333,6)rtal nourishment,
be(938,6) spiritually feasting(546,6)some unearthly reminiscence;—even so
di(454,6)young(700,7)se (433,6) seem look(85,6) towards us, but not at
us(234,8)we were but a bit of Gulfweed in(874,7)new-born sight.
Floating (729,6)ir sides, the(588,9)also(1009,8)quietly eyeing us. One
(192,9)little(457,8),(623,6)from certain queer token(232,6)ed hardly a
day old, might(607,6)measured(344,6)fourteen feet in length(739,6)some six
(29,8)girth. He was a(159,8)frisky; though as yet his body(775,7)
scarc(530,6)recovered(618,8)at irksome position it had so lately
occupi(384,9) maternal reticule; where, tail to head(942,6)all ready

The delicate side-fins(311,6)the palms of his flukes,(746,7)freshly
retaine(48,7)laited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived
from foreign parts.

“Line! line!” cried Queequeg,(779,9)ove(269,6)gunwale; “him fast! him
fast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two(868,6); one big, on(696,8)!”

“What ails ye, man?(144,8)Starbuck.

“Look-e here,” sai(175,12)pointing down.

As whe(517,6)stricke(439,7)(802,12)the tub has reeled out hundreds
of fatho(424,6)rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and
shows(137,6)lackened curling(307,6)buoyantly rising(857,6)piralling
toward(67,6)air; so now,(286,9) saw long coils of(685,6)mbilical cord
of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub(912,7)(654,7)tethered to
its dam. Not seldom(876,8)rapid vicissitude(137,9)chase, this
natural line, wit(123,6)(937,9)end loose, becomes entangled(47,9)
hempen one, so(466,6)the cub is thereby trapped. Some(279,8)subtlest
secret(303,9)seas(249,8)divulged to us(226,6)is enchanted pond. We
saw(312,7)(342,9) amour(54,7)e deep.*

*The sperm(649,8)as(257,6)all other speci(313,10)(425,12)ut
unlike most(48,7)fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons;(692,7)a
gestation(505,7)may probably be set down at nine months, producing but
one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an
Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,
curiously situated, one on each sid(508,9)anus; bu(558,6)breasts
themselves extend up(883,6)from that. When by chance these precious
parts in a nursing(485,6) are cut by the hunter’s lance,(764,6)other’s
pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour(691,8) for rods. The milk
is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well
with strawberries(258,7)overflowing(958,6)mutual esteem(209,6)whales
salute _more hominum_.

And thus,(566,8)surround(144,6)circle upon(12,8)of consternations and
affrights, did(402,7)inscrutable creatures a(497,6)centre freely and
fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled
in dalliance and delight. But even so, am(169,6) tornadoed Atlantic of
my being, do I myself still for ever(197,6)al(525,6)port in mute calm;
and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down
(198,6)ep inland there I(143,7)bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.

Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced(772,6)occasional sudden frantic
spectacles in the distance evince(337,6)activity(1002,8)other boats,
(322,6)engaged in drugging(687,11) o(94,6)frontier(73,8)host; or
possibly carrying(50,8)war with(159,7)first(710,7), where abundance
of room and some convenient retreats were afford(223,6)m(584,6)the sight
(230,7)enraged(208,6)ed(203,8)now (435,7)n blindly darting to and fro
across(795,6)ircles, was noth(43,7)what at last met our eyes. It is
sometime(71,7)ustom when fast to a(354,6) more than commonly powerful
and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or
maim(41,6)s gig(851,6)tail-tendon(175,7) done b(270,10)a short-handled
cutting-spade,(258,6)ich is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A
(243,6)wounded ((766,6)afterwards learned)(725,6)is part, but not
effectually(248,8)seemed, had broken away from the boat,(670,9)
along with him half(724,9)arpoon line; and(859,8)extraordinary agony(619,8)wound, he(546,7)w dashing amo(842,7)revolving(591,8) like the
lone mounted desperado Arnold, a(733,6)battle of Saratoga(209,11)dismay(850,6)ver he went.

But agonizing as wa(726,6)wound(970,6)is(1001,6), and an appalling
spectacle enough, any way; ye(886,6)peculiar horro(1008,6)(538,7)he(411,7)

the intervening distance obscured(497,6)us. Bu(923,6)ength we perceived
that by one(501,8)unimaginable accidents(531,8)fishery,(298,11)
had become entangle(554,9)(579,7)-line that he towed; he had also run
away(649,6)the (866,13) in him(645,6)whil(315,6)free e(443,8)e rope

comrades.

This terrific object(726,7) to recall(850,6)hol(719,6)(648,6)their
stationary fright. First(340,6)whales form(177,8)margin of our lake
began to crowd a litt(944,8)tumble against each other, as if lifted by
half spent billows(818,6)afar; the(705,6)lak(480,9)(123,6)faintly to
heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;
in mor(73,6)more contracting orbits(289,12)(859,7)(42,6)entral
circles(163,7)to swim(901,6)ickening clusters. Yes(711,6)long calm was
departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard(908,6)then like(878,6)e
tumultuous masses of block-ice w(344,8)great river Hudson breaks up in
Spring(877,6)entire host of(552,8)came(497,6)ing upon(614,6) inner
centre(504,8)to pile themselve(104,7) one common mountain. Instantly
Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; (38,9)tak(876,8)stern.

“Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seiz(934,8)helm—“gripe your
oars(736,6)clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,
you(196,9)—(882,9) there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—(84,6)up,
and stay so! (422,8)men—pull, men; never mi(545,6)ir backs—scrape
them!(13,7) away!”

The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
narrow Dardanel(788,6)(59,7)heir(755,6)lengths. But by desperate
endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening;(772,6)giving way
rapidly(434,6)at(526,6)ame time earnestly watching for another outlet.
After many similar hair-breadth escapes,(168,13)wiftly glided into
what had just bee(755,6)of the outer circles, but now crossed by random
(884,6), all violently m(751,6)for(840,6)entre. This lucky salvation was
cheaply purcha(98,7)the loss of(866,9)’s hat, who, while(726,6)ing in
the bows to (695,6)the fugitiv(727,7)s, had his hat taken clean from his
hea(131,9)air-eddy made(152,8)sudden tossing of a pair of broad
flukes close by.

Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
resolved itself(636,6)what seemed a systematic movement; for having
clumped together(717,9)i(513,6)dense body, they(710,6)renewe(950,7)
onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursui(963,6)useless;
bu(770,6)boats still lingered i(918,8)wake to pick up(237,6)drugged(637,7) might be dropped astern(872,6)likewise to secure one which Flask

hand, are inserted upright(492,6)the floating body(635,6)dead(734,6), both
to mark its place on(697,6)ea(280,6)also as token of prior possession,
should(421,11)of any other ship draw near.

The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative(43,6)at sagacious
say(975,6) the Fishery,—the mor(966,8) the less fish. Of all the
(543,7)(41,8)only(500,6)as captur(479,8)rest contrived to escape for

CHAPTER 88. Schools and(12,7)masters(346,7)previous chapter gave account(410,6) imm(958,9) or herd of Sperm
Whales(790,6)ther(273,6)also(996,6)give(549,6)probable cause inducing those
vast aggregations.

Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
have been(326,7)even at(147,7)esent day, small detached bands are
occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.
Such(87,10) known as s(421,6). They generally ar(713,6)wo sorts;(299,7)composed almost entirely of fem(400,12)ose must(816,6)none but young
vigorous (51,7)or bulls, as the(130,6)familiarly designated.

In cavalier attendance upo(867,6)(214,6)(148,13)you invariably see a
male of full grown magnitud(805,7)not old; who,(97,6)any alarm, evinces
his gallantry by fall(1011,11)rear and cov(271,6)the flight of his
ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about
over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all(312,6)olaces and
endearments of the harem. The contrast between(173,6)(148,7) and his
concubines is striking; because, while he is alway(108,9)largest
leviathanic proportions,(37,7)dies(856,10)(456,9)th, are not more
than one-third(209,8)bulk of an average-sized male(788,7)ar(758,6)aratively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen
yards round(418,7)ist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that(735,9)
whole(806,10)hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_.

It is very c(583,7)to watch(622,6)harem and its lord(707,7)ir indolent
ramblings. Like fashionable(408,6)(957,7)or ever (917,7)move in
leisurely search of variety. You meet them(58,8)Line in tim(87,6)the
full flower(672,8)Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,
perhaps, from spend(925,8)summer(961,8)Northern seas, and so cheating
(45,7)of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the(207,6)they have
lounged up and dow(312,6)promenade(231,15) awhile(370,7)start for
the Oriental waters in anticipation(977,8)cool(291,7) there(219,8)
evade the other excessive temperatur(145,9)year.

When serenely advancing on on(190,8)se journeys, if any strange
suspicious sights are seen, my(655,6)whale keeps a wary eye on his
interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan
com(515,6)at way, presume to draw confidentially close to(227,11)
ladies, with what prodigious fur(511,6)Bashaw assails him(601,6)chases
him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled(199,7)rakes like him are
to be permitted to in(477,9)sanctity of domestic bliss; though do
what(179,12)will, he cannot keep(995,7)st notorious Lothario out of
his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashor(736,6) (339,6) often
caus(669,6)most terrible duels amo(964,6)ir rival admirers;(1024,6)so with
the(591,6)s, who sometimes co(497,7)eadly battl(796,7)all for love. They
fence(493,6)(118,6)long lower jaws,(90,11)lock(608,6)em together, and
so striving for(416,6)upremacy(469,6)elks(667,8)rringly interweave(244,6)
antlers. Not a few are captured hav(130,7) deep scars(926,9)
encounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some
instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.

But suppos(152,8)(674,6)r(662,18) to beta(737,6)self away at
the first rush(907,7) harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch
that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk(620,10)m again and
revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to(962,7)(819,8),
like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping(751,7)his thousand concubines.
Granting other(752,7)(327,6) in sight(867,6)fishermen will seldom give
chase to one(554,9) Grand Turks;(690,8)(23,14) are too lavish
(613,6)ir strength(852,6)henc(702,7) unctuousness is small. As(788,8)
sons and(706,6)aughters they beget, why, those (46,9)(42,10)must
take car(208,8)mselves; at least,(978,6)only the maternal help. For(419,6)certain(352,7)omnivorous roving lov(159,6)at might be named, my
Lord Whale has no taste(336,8) nursery, however much(30,9)bower;
and so, being a great traveller, he leav(704,7)anonymous babies all
ove(114,6)world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as
the ardour of youth declines; as year(400,7)umps increase; as
reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude
overtakes the sate(676,6);(1022,6)a love of ease and virtue supplants the
lov(389,6)maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,
admonitory stage of life, forswears, disband(174,6)harem(788,6)grown to
an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among(693,6)eridians
and parallels saying his prayers(906,6)warning each young Leviathan from
his am(738,6)errors.

Now, a(196,11) of whales is called b(841,6)fishermen a school, so i(574,6)lord and master(926,6)at(42,7) technically known(119,7)
(74,6)(53,6). It is therefore not in strict character(854,9)
admirably satirical,(948,6)after going to(136,8)himself, he should then
go abroad inculcating not what(904,7)rned(157,6), but(278,6)olly of it.
His title,(290,7)(269,6), would very naturally seem derived from the
name bestowed(682,10)(415,6)it(190,6)but some have surmised(370,6)the
man who first thus entitled this sort of(793,9)whale, must(84,6)read
(651,6)moirs of Vidocq(744,6)informed(338,8)(296,6)(87,8)a

what w(676,7)nature(604,6)ose occult lessons he(446,9)ed into(293,6)of
his pupils.

The same secludedness(214,6)solation to which the(461,13)(800,6)
betakes(255,9)(193,7)advancing years, is true of(1001,6)ged Sperm
Whales. Almost universally, a lone(907,6)—as a solitary(984,11)is
(930,6)—proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone,
he will(591,6)no one near him but N(378,6)herself; and her he (264,6)to
wife i(687,6)wilderness of water(465,6) th(735,6) of wives she is, though

mentioned, offer a strong contrast to(890,11)(112,7). For while

forty-barrel-bulls, (751,6)y call them, are by far the most pugnacious

CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish(867,7)allusion to(726,6)aif(766,6)aif-poles i(864,6)last chapter but one,
necessitates some accou(483,6)(55,6)ws and regulations(432,8)whale
fishery, of which(138,10)may be deeme(887,6)grand symbol and badge.

It frequently happens(891,6)when several ships are cruising in(440,7)y,
a(149,6)(122,8)struck by one vessel, then escape(796,6)be finally killed
and captured by a(767,7)(67,6);(561,8)ein are indirectly comprised
many minor contingencies, all partaking(766,6)is on(288,8)feature. For
example,—after a weary and perilous chas(887,6)(181,7) of (268,7), the
body may get loose from(888,6)hip by reason(59,6)violent storm; and
drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second(548,6)r, who, in a
calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the
most vexatiou(675,6)(180,8)disputes would often arise between th(697,8)men, were there not(777,6)written or un(13,7), universal,
un(105,7)d law applicable to all cases.

Perhaps the only formal whaling code authoriz(624,6)legislative
enactment, wa(788,7)of Holland. It was decre(686,6)the States-General in
A.D. 1695. But though no (731,6)nation has ever had any(264,9)(174,7)
law, yet the American (333,9) have b(357,7)ir own(207,9)ors and
lawyers in(763,6)matter. They(65,6)provided a system which for terse
comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s Pandect(547,6)the By-laws(888,6)e
Chinese Society(98,6)he Suppressi(787,6)Meddling with(307,7)People’s
Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing,
(123,7)barb(962,6)harpoon, and worn rou(200,7)neck, so small a(707,6)y.

I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.

II. A Loose(51,6)is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch(69,6)But what play(750,6)mischief(309,6)(491,7)sterly(758,6)i(790,6)admirable

expound(218,6)First: What is a(279,10)? Alive or dead a f(250,7)technicall(295,6),
when it is connected(521,6)an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at
all controllable(938,8)occupant or(12,9)s,—a mast, an oar, a
nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand(283,6)bweb,(187,7)all the
same. Likewise(249,27) (248,8)bears a waif(101,6)ny

plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well
(95,6)ir intention so to do.

These are scientific(569,13); but the(591,14)of the whalemen
themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the
Coke-upon-Littleton(101,8)fist. True, among(835,6)ore upright and
honorabl(150,10) allowances are always mad(956,6)peculiar cases, where
it would be an outrageous moral injustic(1024,6)on(443,8)to claim

CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.

“De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.”
_Bracton, l. 3, c. 3._

Latin from the book(494,9)Laws of(630,8),(806,7)taken along with the
context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
that (109,6)the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must hav(713,6)head,
(705,8)Queen be respectfully presented(191,9) tail. A division
which,(639,7)(194,6), is much like halving an apple; there is no
intermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to
this day in force in(399,8);(587,6)s it offers in various(241,8)s a
strange anomaly touching(735,6)eneral law of Fast and(942,11), it is
here treated of in a separate chapter,(466,8)same courteous(997,10)(482,6)prompt(865,6)English railways to be at the expense of(110,11)
car, specially reserv(316,6) the accommodation of royalty. I(625,6)first
place, in cu(311,6)proof(768,8)fact(713,6)the above-mentioned law is
still(416,9), I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that
happen(652,7)(623,7)last two years.

It seems(855,6)some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or(47,6)one
(983,7)Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in kill(747,6)d
bea(574,6)a fin(795,7) which they had originally descried afar off from
the shore(787,6)(152,16) are part(481,6)(198,7)how(816,7)the
jurisdic(484,8)a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.
Hold(780,8)office directly from the crown, I believe, all the(600,6)
emoluments incident to(365,16) territories become by assignment
his. By(481,6)writers this(155,8)is(199,10)sinecure. But not so.
Because the(233,12) is busily employed at times(701,6)bbing his
perquisites;(473,7)are his chiefly by virtue(811,6)at(1008,6)(70,8)of
them.

Now when these poor sun-burn(701,10), bare-footed, an(782,6) their
trowsers rolled high up on(33,6) eely leg(718,7)wearily hauled(69,7)fat fish(62,6)and dry, promis(513,7)mselves a good £150(516,9)
precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea(200,12)wives(222,6)good ale(231,11) cronies, up(218,6) strength(357,6)eir
respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and
charitable gentleman,(366,6)a copy of Blackstone(879,7)his arm; and
laying it(170,10)whale’s head, he says—“Hands off!(710,6)fish, my
masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as(709,16)’s.” U(286,6)is
th(593,7)(583,8) i(530,8)(296,7)ful consternation—so truly
English—knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratch(558,7)ir
heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing(586,9)(301,6) to the
stranger(966,6)that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soft(859,6)
hard heart(557,7)(520,9)(486,9)(851,9)(487,19). At
l(621,7)n(982,7)em, after long(254,12)about fo(537,6)ideas, made
bold to speak,

“Please, sir, who i(471,17)?”

“The Duke.”

“(267,6)e duke had not(375,6)o do(852,7)ak(951,6)(600,7)?”

“It is his.”

“We have been at great trouble(905,6)peril(916,6)some expens(29,7)is all

lights(136,6)case might by a bare possibility(64,9)small degree be
deemed, under(910,6)ircumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman
(998,7)town respectfully addressed a note to(279,10), begging him to
tak(300,6)cas(1015,7)ose unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To
which my(984,6)Duke in sub(216,6) replied (both letters were published)(874,6)h(1011,6)already done so(943,6)(447,18)(967,6)would be
oblig(798,8)e reverend gentleman if fo(378,6)future he ((45,12)
(45,9))(89,7)decline meddling(704,6)(793,6)people’s business. Is this
the still militant old man, standing a(802,6)corners(387,6)e three
kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?

It will readily be seen(731,6)in this(701,6)the alleged right(123,8)Duke
(320,7)(879,10)a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs
inquire then on what principl(929,6)(60,9) is originally invested
with(919,6)right. The law itself has(553,9)been set forth. But Plowdon
gives us(533,7)ason for it. Says(41,8)(989,6)(246,6)so caught belongs(277,8)King and Queen, “becau(831,6)its superior excellence.” And by the
soundest commentator(563,6) has ever(206,6)held a cogent argument(858,6)ch
matters.

But why shoul(798,6)King hav(991,6)head(835,6)the(185,6)(616,6)ail? A(276,7)
(794,6)at, ye lawyers!

In his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or(269,6)-pin(919,9) old King’s Bench
author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Y(160,6) is y(181,7)’s,
that(17,11) wardrobe ma(753,6)upplied(934,6)y(710,7)bone.” Now(925,6)was written at a time wh(281,7)black limber bone(922,8)Greenland or
Right(806,11)largely used in ladies’ bodices(661,6)this same(88,6)is
no(925,7)(401,6); it is(19,8)(444,6)which is a sad mistake for a
sagacious(437,7) like(347,7)(778,6)i(764,6)(506,6)a mermaid, to be
present(308,8)a(536,8)n allegorical meaning may lurk here.

There are two royal fish so style(762,8) English law writers—(882,9)
(671,8)sturgeon; both(81,7)property under certain limitations, and
nominally(520,6)ying(746,6)enth branch(460,8)crown’s ordinary revenue. I
know not that any other (708,6) has hinted(537,8)(910,6); but by
inference it seems to me(80,6)(231,12) must be divid(569,6)the same
way a(444,6)whale,(989,10)receiv(224,8)highly dense and elastic head
peculiar to(209,6)fish(597,7), symbolically regarded, may possibly be
humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And(988,6)there
(266,6)a reason in all things, even(824,6)w.


CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.

“In vain it was to r(801,8)Ambergriese(872,8)pau(521,9)is

V.E._

I(128,6)a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when
we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea,(609,9)
many noses o(595,6)(321,6)’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than
the three pairs of eyes aloft. A (604,9)and not very pleasant smell
was smelt(734,9)ea.

“I will bet someth(360,6)w,” said Stubb, “tha(34,6)where hereabouts are
some(981,6)ose drugged(817,6)s we tickled the(967,7)day. I thought they
would keel up before long.”

Presently(898,6)vapors in advance slid aside; and(752,6)(972,8)distance
lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened(934,6)some sort of(1024,6) must

such a mass(204,6)exhale; worse than an Assyrian city(788,8)plague,
whe(944,6)living are incompetent to bur(427,6)departed. So intolerable
indeed is it regarded by som(311,7) no cupidity could persuade them to
moor(415,11)of it. Yet are(741,7)(887,6)who(973,6)still do it;
notwithstanding(467,6)act(514,9) oil obtained from such subjects is of
a very inferior quality(636,6)by no means of the nature of
attar-of-rose.

Coming(166,7)(815,6) with(762,6)xpiring breeze, we saw(174,10)(836,6)man

(246,6). Yes, I’m for it;” (1008,6) saying he started(369,8)
quarter-deck.

By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; s(854,7)whether
or no(839,6)Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope
of esc(843,6)except by its breez(503,8)gain. Issuing(461,8)e cabin,
Stubb now called his boat’s crew(967,6)pulled off(651,9)stranger.
Drawing across her bow, he perceived(987,6)in accordance(205,6)the
fanciful French taste(287,6)upper part of her stem-piece was carved in
the likeness(983,6)huge drooping stalk, was painted green(226,6)for
thorns had copper spikes project(320,9)it here(851,6)here; the whole
terminating(999,6)symmetrical folded bulb(164,6)bright red colour. Upon
her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de
Rose,”—Rose-button, or (16,7)d;(183,7)is was the romantic name(835,6)is
aromatic ship.

Though (562,6)did not underst(266,7) _(135,6)_(435,9)the inscription,
yet(301,6)ord _rose_(612,6)the bulbous figure-head put together,
sufficiently explaine(124,6)whole to him.

“A wooden r(250,7), eh?” he cried(846,6)his hand(57,6)s nose, “(944,6)ill
do very well; but how like all creation it(934,6)s!”

Now in order to hold direct communic(55,6)(774,8) people on deck, he
had to pull rou(293,8)ows to(902,7)arboard side(329,8)us come close
(43,7)blasted whale(517,6)so talk over it.

Arr(943,7)en at(551,6)spot,(943,6)one(302,6)still(308,14)he
bawled—(653,7)-de-Rose, ahoy! are(815,6) any of you (43,14)s that
speak English?”

“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man(918,6)(577,7)warks, who turned out to be
the chief-mate.

“Well, then, my(142,15)(565,6)have you seen the White Whale?”

“_What_(346,6)?”

“The _White_(39,6)—a Sperm(14,7)Moby Dick(94,8)e(93,6)him?

“Nev(1023,6)rd of such a(441,6). Cachalot Blanche!(143,12)—no.”

“Very good(220,6); good bye now(880,6)I’ll call again in a minute.”

Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod(961,6)seeing Ahab leaning
over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two
hands into a trumpet(702,6)houted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab
retire(164,7)Stubb re(538,7)(838,7)Frenchman.

He now perce(779,7)at the(626,13)(608,6)had just got(162,6)the

“I wish it was broken, or(220,6)I didn’t(745,6)any(141,6)at all!” answered

much. “But what ar(860,6)holding _yours_ for?”

“Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I(925,6)to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t
it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will
ye, Bouton-de-Ros(1022,6)What in the devil’s name do you want (420,7)roared(591,13)man,
flying(742,8)sudden passion.

“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, t(543,10)word! why don’t you pack those
whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But jo(19,6)side, though; do
you know, Rose-bud(134,6) it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
such (149,6)? As f(656,8)dried up on(734,8), he hasn’t a gill in his
whole carcase.(749,6)know(951,6)well en(188,6)but, d’ye se(823,6) Captain here won’t believe
it; this is his first voyage;(726,9) Cologne manufacturer before. But
come aboard, and mayhap he’ll(110,8) you, if h(135,8)me; and so I’ll
get(313,7)(150,6)dirty scrap(247,6)Anyth(366,7)oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb,
and with(466,6)he soon mounted to(741,7)ck. There a queer scene
presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were
getting the heavy tack(701,7)readines(561,8)e(580,7). But they worked
(1007,7)slow and talked very fast(399,6)seemed in a(322,8)but a good
humor. All their noses upwardly projected from(36,7)faces like so many
jib-booms. N(143,8)hen pairs(469,6)em would drop(110,7)work(566,6)run up
(386,7)mast-head(860,8)some fresh air. Some think(329,7)y(93,7)catch
the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar(686,6)at intervals held it(520,7)ir
nostrils. Others having broken the stem(226,8)ir pipes almost short
off at the bowl(517,6) vigorously puff(730,6)bacco-smoke, so(997,6)it
constantly filled(430,7)olfactories.

Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries(249,6)nathemas proceeding from
the Captain’s round-house abaft(952,6)looking in(843,6)direction saw a
fi(647,6)ce thrust(577,6)behi(540,6) door, which wa(381,7)ajar(134,6)within. This was the torm(896,6)surgeon, who, after in vain
remonstrating agains(384,6)(235,10)(661,8) day, had betaken himself(651,8)(266,22)(_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the
pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreat(419,7)
indignations at times.

Marking all this, (506,6)argued well for his scheme(868,6)turn(616,6) the
Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during(427,7)(756,6)ranger mate
expressed his detestation of his(589,8) as a conceited ignoramus, who
had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.
Sounding him carefully(285,8)further perceived(861,6)the (265,12)
ha(417,6)the slightest suspicion(192,6)(328,7)he ambergris. He therefore
hel(272,6)peace o(807,7)head, but otherwise was quite frank and
confidential(394,11)so(182,10)two quickly concocte(452,11)plan
for both circumven(787,6)nd satiriz(200,8)(1009,7), with(656,8)at all
dreaming of distrust(256,7)ir sincerity. Accord(611,9)is(141,13)(881,6)irs,(374,17), under cover of an interpreter’s office,
was to tell(927,12) w(350,6) please(356,7)as coming from(806,6); and
as for(824,6), h(389,6)to utter any nonsense(551,6)should come uppermost
in him(800,8)the(181,6)view.

By(260,6)time(300,7)destined victim appeared(160,6)his cabin. H(535,6)a
small and dark(571,6)rather delicate looking man for a sea-c(466,12)
large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet
vest(653,6)watch-seals a(556,6)side. T(504,7)gentleman(895,8)was now
politely introduced by(529,19)who at once ostentatiously put
on(895,6)spect of(559,10)ing between them.

“W(452,6)all I say to him first?” said he(43,6)y,(17,7)(542,7)eye(1006,8)(265,6) vest and the(268,6)(851,6)eals, “you
may as well begin by telling him(968,6)h(445,6)s a sort of babyish to me,
though I don’t pretend to be a judge.”

“He says, Monsieur(198,8)(876,18)in French, turn(944,7)his
(564,9)“that only yesterday(487,6)hip spoke a vessel, whose (625,7)
and chief-mate(640,6) six sailors, had all died of a fever caught(941,6)a
blasted whale they had brought alongside.”

Upon(878,7)h(138,9) started, and eagerly desired to know mor(505,7)at now(527,8)(659,16) to(716,6)(550,8) since he takes it so easy, tell(487,10)now I have eyed him
carefully, I’m quite certain(541,8)’s no more fit to command a

Hear(408,6)is(658,6)(1023,8)vowed(698,9)y wer(403,6)grateful parties
(meaning(189,8) and mate)(440,6)oncluded by inviting Stubb down into
his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.(878,6)wants you to take a glass of wine with him,(515,11)interpreter.

“Thank him heartily; but(1009,10)it’s against my princip(625,7)drink

had best drop all four boat(928,7)pull(868,9) away(986,6)thes(903,8),

By this time(520,7)was over(966,6)ide(792,6)getting into his boat, hailed

lighter(258,6) of the two(286,9) ship’s side. Whil(839,6)Frenchman’(134,6)(895,6)n,(873,6)engaged in tow(930,6)(380,7)one way,(835,6)
benevolently towed(414,6)(585,7)(152,6)the (518,6)way, ostentatiously
slack(213,8)a most unusually(312,14).

Pres(110,6)a breeze sprang up;(984,7)feigned to cast off(273,10)whale;
hoisting(473,9)(258,6)(281,10) soon increased(762,6)istance, while
the Pequod slid in between him and(610,6)’(266,7). Whereupon(320,7)quickl(473,6)(178,6)the floating body(770,6)hail(393,8)(115,7)to give
notice(926,8)intentions, at once proceed(275,6)reap(102,6)ru(981,9)

excavation in the(191,8) little behind(870,9) fin. You(767,7)almost
have thought he was digg(840,6)cellar there(103,8)sea; and when at
length(183,6)pade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up
old Roman tiles and pottery buri(802,6)fat English loam. H(595,7)’s crew
were all(1015,6)gh excitement, eagerly help(874,7)ir chief(506,6)looking

when suddenly(951,6)ou(435,6)very heart of this plague,(528,7)stole a
faint stream of perfum(951,6)ch flowed through(308,7)de of bad smells
without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into a(741,6)n
along with another, (87,8)at all blendi(38,8)it for a time.

“I have it, (11,10)” cried(387,6)(82,6) delight, striking something

Dropp(1018,9)(1007,9)thrust both hands in(589,7)rew out handfuls of

cheese;(506,6)unctuou(904,6)savory withal. You might easily dent it with
your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this,
good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any
druggist. Some six(300,10)were obtained; but more was unavoidably

CHAPTER 92. A(319,8).

Now(975,6)(340,9) is a(1009,6)curious substance(247,7)o important as an
article of commerce,(635,6)in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that
subject. For(64,6)at tim(188,7)indeed until a comparatively late day,
the precise origin of(292,11)remained,(852,6)amber itself, a problem
to the learned. Though the word(373,14)bu(238,6)French compound
for grey(759,6), ye(278,6)two(410,10)s are quite distin(260,9)mber,
t(123,6)(269,7)s found(310,6)e sea-coast(863,6)lso dug up in some far
inl(511,6)ils, wherea(569,15)never(92,7)except up(101,10).
Besides,(307,8)s a hard, transparent, brittle, odorles(644,12)
used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments(990,6)(744,9)
is soft, waxy(730,9)highly fragrant(1000,6)picy(720,8)t is largely(139,6)in perfumery, in pastiles,(580,6)ous candles, hair-powders, and
pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking(1021,6)also carry it to Mecca, for
the same purpose(894,6)frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.
Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.

Who would think, then(316,7)such fine ladie(416,6)gentlemen should
regale themselves with an essence(700,7)i(700,6)inglorious bowels of a
sick whale! Yet so(443,6). By some(643,7)(894,8)suppos(283,6)be the
cause(537,6)by others the effect, of the dyspepsia(147,8)whale. How to
cure(251,6)a(43,12)t were hard to say, unless by administering
three or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pill(598,6) then running out of
harm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.

I have forgotten(167,7)(776,6)there(195,6)(399,11)is(865,10),
certain(993,7)round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be
sailors’ trowsers button(979,7)it afterwards turned out(169,9)y were
nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalm(991,6)that manner.

Now(260,9) incorruption(529,6)is most fragrant(616,11)(738,6) be
(707,13)heart of(801,6)decay; is(336,6)(182,7)? Bethink thee(635,6)at
saying of(976,6)aul in Corinthians, about (166,11)and(183,13);
h(210,8)we are sown in dishonor, but rais(272,6)glory. And likewise
call to mind(1007,7)(156,9)Paracelsus(142,7)what(912,6)(348,8)keth the
best musk. Also forget no(368,6)strange fac(481,7)of all things of
ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is
the worst.

I(441,8)like to conclude the chapter wi(194,6) above appeal, but
cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against
whalemen(988,6)which,(574,8)estima(640,8)some already biased minds,
(848,8) considered as indirectly substantiated by(424,6)has been said
of the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere(824,6)is volum(299,6)slanderous
aspersion(95,10)disproved,(863,10)voc(219,9)whaling(414,6)roughout a slatternly, untidy business. But t(144,6)s another(556,6) to
rebut. They hin(594,7)all(208,7) always smell bad. Now how did this
odious stigma originate?

I opine(207,7)(751,6)plainly traceable to the first arrival(992,6)e
Greenl(500,6)(253,6)ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because
those(420,6)men did(849,8)(595,7)do not now, try o(311,6)ir oil at sea
as the Southern(140,7)have(296,8)done; but cutting up(222,6)resh
blubber in small bits, thrust it (472,7) the bung holes of large casks,
and carry it hom(621,7)at manner;(622,6)hortness(334,7) season(824,6)ose
Icy Seas(854,6)the sudden and violent storms to(887,6) they are exposed,
forbidding any (611,6)course. Th(880,6)equence is(734,7)upon breaking
in(519,7)hold(998,6)unloading one(529,7)(453,8) cemeteries,(873,6)(556,12)dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar(640,6)at arising
from excavat(212,6) old city grave-yard, for(697,6)oundations of a
Lying-in Hospital.

I partly surmise also(1000,9)is wicked charge against(902,6)rs may be
likewise imputed(828,8)existence on the coast of (833,9), in former
times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg,(520,6)
latter name i(793,6)one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great
work on Smells, a text-book(206,6)at subject. As its(117,7)mports
(smeer, fat; (162,6)to put up),(350,6)(224,8)was(432,6)ed in order to
afford a place(475,9)(944,8)(832,7)(300,6)(641,6)fleet to be tried
out, without being taken(929,6)to Holland(569,7)at purpose. It was a
collection of furnaces, fat-kettle(941,7)oil sheds; and whe(505,6)works
were in full operation certainly gave(784,7)no very pleasant(822,6). But
all(670,6)is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler;(549,6) in a
voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with
oil, does not,(63,10)consume fifty days i(772,6)business of boiling
out(305,6)(36,7)state(1023,6)it is casked,(719,6)il is nearly scentless.
The truth is(964,7)living or dead, if but decently treated,(978,6)s as a
species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can(641,6)men be
recognised, a(902,6)people(692,8)middle ages affected to detect a Jew
(306,7)company,(960,8)nose. Nor indeed ca(614,7)hale possibly be
otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high
health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it
is true, seldom(529,8)open air. I say(442,7)the mo(883,8)(711,7)
Whale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as(900,6)a musk-scented
lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. W(139,7)n shall I lik(980,6)
(857,11) to for(352,8)ce(769,6)idering his magnitude? Must it not be

It was but some few(989,6)after encount(246,6)the Frenchman(912,7)a most
significant event befell(502,7)st in(36,12)(821,7)Pequod’s crew;

nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;
ye must remember his tambourine on(874,6)dramatic midnight, so
gloomy-jolly.

In outer aspect(154,6)and Dough-Boy(259,7) match, like a black pony and
a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven
in one eccentric span(502,6)(646,6)hapless(159,11)was by nature dull
and torpid in his intellects, P(500,6)(141,6)ver tender-hearted, was at
bottom very br(321,6)(483,7)at pleasant, genial, joll(42,8)ness
peculiar to(420,6)ribe; a(9,6), which ever enjoy all holidays and
festivities(606,6)finer, freer relish than any other race. For(420,6)s,
the year’s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five
Fourth of Jul(162,6) New Y(92,6)Days. Nor smile so,(437,7)I write that
this(802,8)(582,6)was brilliant, for even(612,6)ness has it(38,10)cy;
behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king’s cabinets(588,6)Pip loved
life, and all life’s peaceable securities; so(856,6)the panic-striking
business in(470,7)he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had
most sadly blurred his(593,11);(835,7), as ere long will be seen,
what was thus temporarily subdu(276,6)him, in the end was destined to be
luridly illumined by strange wild fires,(781,6)fictitiously showed him
off to ten times the(938,6)al(438,6)e(851,6)(779,6)(941,7)native Tolland
County in Connecticut,(354,8)once enlivened many a fiddler’s frolic on
the green;(496,6)t melodious even-tide(995,7)his gay ha-ha! had turned
the round horizon into one star-b(634,6)tambourine. So,(442,7)(373,7)
clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the
pure-watered diamond drop(522,6)healthful glow; yet, whe(494,6)cunning
jeweller would show you the(84,9)in its most impressive(439,7), he
lays it(179,11)gloomy ground(856,6)then lights it up, not by the sun,
but by some un(544,8)gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences,
infernally superb;(122,6)the evil-blazing(307,8),(570,6)(241,6)vinest
symbol of(300,6)rystal skies, looks like(169,6)crown-jewel stolen from
the King of Hell. But let us to(246,6)tory.

It came to pas(846,8)(922,7)ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman
chanced so to spra(839,7)hand, as for a ti(105,6)become quite maimed;
and, temporarily, Pip was put(738,6)his place.

The first(86,6)Stubb lowered(833,8)m(68,6)evinced much nervousness;
but happily, for(253,6)time, escaped close contact(923,6)the whale; and
therefore(330,6)off not altogether discreditably;(906,8)(180,6)observing
him, took care,(357,6)wards, to exhort him to cherish his courage(215,7)
(482,7)utmost(216,6)he might often find it needful.

Now upo(931,6)second(334,6)ing, the boat paddled(43,10)(263,10) as
the fish received(974,6)arted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
happened,(645,6)is instance,(572,6) right under poor Pip’s seat. The
involuntary consternation(856,8)moment caused(338,8)leap,(226,7) in
(701,6)out(910,8)boat(235,6)in such a way(819,7)par(42,9)slack(547,6)
line coming against(437,6)hest, he breasted it overboar(708,12)so as
(824,10)entangled in it, when at last plumping(819,6)the water. That
(332,6)t(487,6)tricken(716,6) st(424,6)on a fierce run(510,6)line swiftly
straightened(508,6)presto!(399,9)(778,6)all foaming up (664,7)chocks of
(599,8), remorselessly dragg(573,6)re by(130,9)(548,7) had taken
several turns around(351,10) and neck.

Tashtego stood(605,6)e bows. He was full(547,8)fire(559,8)hunt. He
hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching(812,9)-knife from its sheath, he
suspended(25,7)arp edge over(237,11)and turning towards Stubb,
exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime(798,7)blue, choked face
plainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All pass(620,6)a flash. In less than
half a minute,(947,6)entire thing (978,8).

“Damn(726,6)cut!” roared(214,6)(860,6)s(693,7)hal(406,6)lo(457,7)Pip was
saved.

So soon as he recover(976,6)self(697,6)poor little negro was assailed by
yells and execrations(440,6)the crew. Tranquilly permitt(492,7)se
irregular cursings to evaporate,(436,6) then(326,6)plain, business-like,
but still half humorous manner, curs(638,7)officially(895,6)that done,
un(29,10) gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never
jump(699,6)a(930,7)Pip, except—but all the rest was indefinite, as the
soundest(112,7) ever is. Now, in general, _Stick t(508,6)boat_, is your
true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes(624,7) when _Lea(202,6)
(90,14)(362,6)better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last(356,6)if
he should give undiluted conscientious(243,8)to(314,6)he would be
leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future;(584,7)suddenly
dropped all(466,7), and concluded with a peremptory command, “(370,8)(280,9)(484,7)or by the Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind
that. We can’t afford to los(973,7)s(88,8)likes of you; a(1003,8)ould
sell(248,7)irty (466,6)what you(324,6)(653,7)in Alabama. Bear(418,7)n
mind(266,6)don’t(335,6)any more.” Hereby perhaps(926,7)indirectly hinted,
that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,
which propensity too often interferes(424,6)his benevolence.

But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was
under very similar circum(1015,6)s(886,8)first performance(867,6)this
time he did not breast out(466,7)ne(134,6)hence,(892,6)th(506,7) started
to run, Pip was left behind o(222,6)sea, like a hurried traveller’s
trunk. Alas!(785,7)was(170,6)oo true to his word(262,8) a beautiful,
bounteous, blue day;(126,6)pangled sea calm(849,7)ol(859,6)flatly
stretching away, all round,(334,8)horizon(204,7)gold-beater’s skin
hammered(325,6)(387,6)extremest. Bobbing up(714,7)wn(513,6)at(292,6)Pip’s
ebon head showed(315,9)ead of cloves. No boat-knife(380,6)ifted when
he fell so rapidly astern.(798,6)’s inexorable back was turned upon him;
and(502,11)was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless
ocean(470,6)etween Pi(262,6)Stubb. Out from the centre(784,8)sea, poor
Pip(161,8)his crisp, curling, black(314,6)(768,7)sun, another lonely
cast(482,6)though(750,6)oftiest (239,8)brightest.

Now, in(573,6)weather, to swim(963,8)open (231,6)is as easy(904,7)
practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. B(911,7)awful
lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self(171,7)
midd(417,7)uch(602,6)rtless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,
how when sailors(199,6)dead(869,6)bathe(285,13)sea—mark how closely
they hug their sh(535,7)only coast along her sides.

But ha(572,7) really abandone(687,6)poor little negro to his fate? No;
he did not mean to, at least. Because there were tw(882,6)s in his wake,
and he supposed, no doubt,(987,6)they woul(958,6)ourse come up to Pip
very quickly, and pick him up;(682,7), indeed,(440,6)conside(484,6)s
towards oarsmen jeopardized thr(747,8)ir own timidity, is not always

called, is marked wit(946,6)same ruthless detest(750,6)peculiar to

spying whales(725,6)(1012,7)m on one side, turned(475,6)gave chase; and
Stubb’s boat was now so far awa(529,7)he(190,6)ll his crew so(1010,6)t
upo(660,6)fish(633,7)Pip’s ringed horizon began to exp(270,6)ound him

but from(764,6)hour the(907,14)went about the deck an idiot; such,
(906,8),(832,6)said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept(259,7)nite body
up, but drowned the in(34,7)of his soul. No(38,10)entirely,(890,7).
Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of
the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;
an(199,6)miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heap(937,7)among the
joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw(534,6)ultitudinous,
God-omnipresent, coral insects(851,7)out of(1003,7)rmament of waters

indifferent as his God.

Fo(912,6)rest, blame not Stubb too hardly(869,6)thing is common in that
fishery(594,6)i(398,6)sequel(485,8)narrative, it will(168,6)be seen what
like abandonment befell myself.


CHAPTER 94. A Squeez(497,8) Hand.

That wha(522,6)Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brough(408,7)e
Pequod’s side(960,8)all those cutting and hoisting operations
previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even(125,7) baling of
the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.

While some(93,6)occupied with this latter duty, others(137,6)employed in
dragging away the larger tub(314,6)soon as fill(96,10)e sperm; and
whe(903,6)proper time arrived,(141,6)sam(51,7) was carefully manipulated
ere going(271,8)try-works, of(798,6) anon.

It had coole(797,6)crystallized to such a degree,(884,6)when, with
several(282,7), I sat down before a(268,6) Constantine’s bath of it, I
found it strangely concreted into lumps, (583,6)nd there rolling about
(824,7)liquid part. It was our business to s(761,7)these(93,6) back
into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder(273,6)in old times this
(421,10)(321,7)favourite cosmetic. S(348,6)clearer!(364,8)sweetener!
(18,8)of(17,6)(399,10)licious molifier! After having my hands in it
for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it
were, to serpentin(395,6)spiralise.

As(514,7)(416,6)at my ease, cross-legged o(746,6)deck; after(953,6)itter
exertion (73,6) windlass; under a blue tranquil sky;(846,6)hip(36,6)
indolent sail(206,6)gliding so serenely along; as I bathed(315,9)
among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost
with(667,7)hour; as they richly broke to(397,11)(382,6)discharged all
their opulence,(428,6)(1023,6)ripe grapes (39,6)wine(215,7)snuffed up that
uncontaminated aroma,—literally(863,6)ruly(99,7)the smell of spring
violets; I declare to you,(785,6)fo(465,6)time I lived as in a musky
meadow; I forgot all(969,6) our horrible oath; in(874,8)expressible(870,6), I was(443,12) an(456,6)eart of it; I(401,7)(726,6) to credit
the old Paracelsan superstitio(121,7)(977,6)is of rare virtue in
allaying(483,6)eat of anger; while bathing(198,9)bath, I(884,6)divinely
free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice,(103,6)y sort
whatsoever.

Squeeze! s(9,9)(18,8)all the morning (768,6)I(42,8)d(238,11)
till I myself(318,8)melted into(343,7)(59,19) till a
strange so(392,7)nsanity came over me; and I found(110,8)unwittingly
(198,6)ing my co-laborers’(494,7)in it, mistak(393,7)ir(523,7)(651,7)
(956,15). Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving
feeling did this avocation beget;(765,6)at last(663,6) continual(201,13)(162,11)(1005,6)looking up(347,6)(1006,6)eyes sentimentally; as
much as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish
(574,6)cial acerbities, or know(1018,6)lightest ill-humor or envy! Come;
let us(620,8)(898,8)ll round; nay, (37,7)all(41,9)ourselves into
each other;(46,8)(42,18)universally(296,9) very milk and
(938,6)of kindness.

Woul(731,7)I could keep(800,7)(956,6)(997,9)for ever! For now, since
by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceiv(853,8)in all
cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of
attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect (785,7)fancy; but(35,8)wife, the heart(11,6)bed(20,6)tabl(31,7)sadd(12,7)
firesid(57,7)country; (576,6)at(268,18)all this, I am ready
to(576,9)case eternally. In thoughts of(497,6)ision(15,9)night, I
saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his(686,7)in a jar of(576,6)aceti.

Now, while discoursing of(556,6), it behoove(911,6)peak of(713,6) things
akin to it,(399,8)business of prepar(646,6)e(645,7)whale f(428,7)try-works.

First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from(455,7)pering
part(337,8)fish, and also(45,11)hicker port(370,8)his flukes. It
is toug(339,7)congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some
oil. After being sever(186,12)wha(641,8)(248,11) is f(275,6)ut
into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like
blocks of Berkshire marble.

Plum-pudding is(793,6)erm bestowed upon certain fragmentary par(706,9)
whale’s flesh, here and t(10,6)dhe(528,6)(175,6)blanket of blubber, and
often participat(226,7)a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is
a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name
imports, it i(895,7) exceedingly rich, mottled tint,(905,6)a bestreaked
snowy and golden ground, dotted(955,6)spo(333,9) deepest crimson and
purple(225,7) plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,
(203,6)hard to keep yourself(851,6)e(374,6)it. I confess, that once I
stole behi(480,6) foremast to try(60,6)t tasted something as I should
conceive a royal cutlet(938,13)gh of Louis le Gros might have
(96,6), supposing him to have been kille(165,7)irst day after the
venison s(285,6)(689,7)at(642,7)ular (36,14) contemporary(492,7)n
unusually fine vintage(462,8)vineyards of Champagne.

There is another substance(139,6)a very singular one, which turns up in
the cours(114,7)is business, but(51,7)I feel i(751,7)(92,6)puzzling
adequately to describ(623,9)called slobgollion; an appellation
original(769,6)the whaleme(344,7)even so is the natur(291,9)(249,9).
(736,6)an ineffably oozy, stringy affair,(994,6)frequently found in the
tubs of sperm,(499,7)a prolonged squeezing(502,6)subs(74,6) decanting. I
hold(307,10)the wondrously thin, ruptured membran(897,6)the case,
coalescing.

Gurry, so(339,7), is a term properly belonging to right(332,11)but
sometimes incidentally used by(338,6)perm fishermen. It designates the
dark, glutinous(638,10)(612,7)is scraped of(715,6)back(727,7)
Greenland or(166,12)(839,6)much of(687,7)cover(505,6)deck(290,7)ose
inferior souls who hunt(903,6)ignoble Leviathan.

Nippers. Strict(391,6)s word is not indigenous to(651,10)’s
vocabulary. But as appli(312,6)(689,10)it becomes so. A(716,7)an’s
nipper(440,6)short firm strip of tend(337,7)tuff cut from the tapering
part of(219,10)’s tail: it average(775,7)ch(726,6)ick(980,6)and for the
rest(581,6)bout(845,6)iz(857,9)iron (108,8)a hoe. Edgewise moved along
the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless
blandishments, as of magic, allures(111,6) with it all impurities.

But to learn all(216,10)se recondite matters, your best way is at
once to descend in(519,7)blubber-room(1016,6)have a long talk(153,8)s
inmates. This place has previ(1024,6)been mentioned a(737,6)receptacle for
(120,6)anket-pieces, when(561,6)t(134,6)oisted(551,10)whale. When the
proper time arrives for cutting up its cont(379,6)this apartment is a
scen(537,6)error to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by
a dull lantern, a sp(285,8)been left clear(678,8) workmen. They
generally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and(96,6)de-ma(64,6)

name. The gaff is something(751,8)boat-hook. With his gaff, the

slipping,(570,8)ship pitches and lur(12,6)bout. Meanwhile(132,6)(279,9) stand(135,6)he(134,7)itself, perpendicularly chopping it into
the portable horse(680,7)(763,7)spad(360,6)harp as hone can make it;(143,10)man’s feet are shoeless; the (352,6)he(176,11)will(380,6)imes
irresistibly slide away(793,6)him,(414,8)sledge. If he cuts off one of
his own toes, or(24,7) his assistants’, would you be very much
astonished? Toes(204,6)carce among veteran(489,8)-room men.


CHAPTER 95(611,6)Cassock.

Ha(109,6)stepped on(678,6) the Pequod at a certain junctur(950,6)his
post-mortemizing(726,8)whale; and h(101,9)rolled forward nigh the
windlass, pretty sure am I that you(282,7)have scanned with no small
curiosity a(314,6)strange, enigmatical object, which(89,17)een

surprise you, as half a glimps(459,7)at unaccoun(889,6)cone,—longer than
a Kentuckian is tall,(453,6)a foot in diameter a(275,6)base, and
jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it
is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such(73,8) as that
found(460,8)secret groves(133,8)n Maachah in Judea(717,6)for
worshipping(584,6), King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the

set forth(667,8)15th chapter(910,8)First Book of Kings.

grenadier carr(960,6) dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the
forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove it(407,6) pelt,
as an African hunter(1013,6)elt of a boa. This done he turn(309,6)pelt
inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as
almost to doubl(168,7)(937,7)(727,6)at last hangs it, well spread, in
the rigging, to dry. Ere (528,6)it is taken down; when(281,6)ing some
three feet of it, toward(240,7)ointed extremity(820,6)then cutting two
slits(810,6)rm-holes(805,8)other end, he lengthwise slips himself
bodily into it. T(750,9) now stands before you invested(868,8)full

B(71,7)her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly
distinguished by her try-works. She present(663,6)(807,8)anomaly of the
most solid masonry joining(793,6)oak and hemp in constitut(970,7)
completed ship. It is as if(527,10)open field a brick-kiln were
transported to her planks.

The(214,10) are (985,8)between the foremast and mainmast,(942,6)ost

mortar, some ten feet by (68,6)square(780,6)five in height. The
foundation does not penetrate(217,9), b(746,7)(467,8)is firmly
secur(361,6)the surface by ponderous knees of iron brac(730,7)on all
sides(945,6)screw(760,7)down(88,8)(342,7). O(418,7)lanks it is cased
with woo(888,7)at top (591,8)ly cover(733,6)a large, sloping, battened
hatchway. Rem(900,6)this hatch we expos(285,6)great try-pots, two in
number(1023,6)each of several barrels’ capacity. When not in use, they
are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they(710,6)ol(954,6)with soapstone
and sand, till(48,6)shine within like silver punch-bowls. Dur(915,8)night-watches(619,6)cynical old sailors will crawl in(528,6)m and coil
themselves away there for a nap. While employed in(213,7)(134,7)m—one
man in(342,6)pot, side by side—many confidential communications are
carried on, over the(666,6)lips. It is a place also for profound
mathematical meditation. It was (966,7)left hand(544,8) of the Pequod,(688,6)the(430,10) diligently circling round me, that I was first
indirectly struck by the(563,10)e fact(59,7)in geometry all bodies
gliding alo(496,6) cycloid, my(157,11)for example,(492,6)descend from
any point in precisel(143,6)same time.

masonry(335,6)at(514,6)is(920,7)d, penetrat(1003,6)the(920,6)ron mouths of
the furnaces, (328,9)undernea(411,7)pots. These(60,8)are fitted(450,6)heavy doors of iron. The intense hea(508,9)fire is prevented
from(678,12)ng itself (834,6) deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
extending(194,6) the entire inclosed surface(648,8)works. By a tunnel
inserted at(584,7)ar, this(107,10) is kept replenished with water as
fast as it evaporate(327,6)re are no external chimneys; they open(399,7)(284,6)(136,8) wall. And here let us go back for a moment.

(908,7)about nine o’clock at night(847,6)(913,10)’s(622,10) were
first started on(265,6)present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee
the business.

“All ready there? Off hatch, then, and(118,6) her. You cook,(574,6)the
(443,6)” This(232,6)n easy thing, fo(514,6)carpenter had been thrusting
his shavings in(623,7)(788,7) throughou(522,6)passage. Here be it said
that in a whaling(281,7)(992,8)st(757,7)n(977,14) has to be fed
(447,6)time(588,7)ood. After(998,6)no wood is used, except as a(795,9)
quick ignition(835,8)staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,
the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still
contains considerable of its unctuous properti(798,7)se(72,9) feed
the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming
misanthrope, once(284,6)ed, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by
(26,8)body. Would(832,6)he (110,6)ed(63,9)smoke! for his(15,6) is
horrible to inhale(748,6)(12,6) it you must(772,6)not only that, but you
must live in it(749,9)tim(911,6)h(785,6)unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor
about it, such as may lurk(684,8)vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells
lik(749,6)left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argumen(188,9)
pit.

By midnigh(885,6)(809,6)we(831,6)full operation. We(27,6)clear from the
carcase; sail(1016,10)made;(501,6)ind was freshening(25,8)ld ocean
darkness was intense. But(909,6)(31,13)licked up by(1014,7)erce
(697,6), which at intervals forked forth(186,9) sooty flues, and
illuminated every lofty rope(421,8)rigging, as with(130,6)amed Greek
fire. The(817,9)ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs(527,7)
bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing(450,9)ir(518,10)harbors,(219,6)broad
sheets of flame for sails, bore down upo(709,6)Turkish frigat(346,8)folded them in conflag(602,6)s.

The hatch, removed(423,10)top(738,8)works, now afforded a wide
hearth in front(788,7)m. Standing on thi(736,7)the Tartarean shapes of
the pagan harpooneers, always(805,6)hale-ship’s stokers. With huge
pronged poles they(435,6)ed hissing masses of blubber int(478,6)scalding

with (910,6)and burning a corps(22,7)plung(976,11)at(246,13)
darkness, seem(217,7)material counterpart of(227,7)nomaniac commander’s
soul.

So(72,8)it to me, as I stood a(414,6)helm(501,6)for long hours silently
guid(358,8)a(966,7)is fire-ship o(934,6)sea. Wrapped, for that
interval, in (227,8) myself, I but(513,6)etter saw(388,6)ed(268,6)the
ma(13,10) ghastli(556,8)others. The continual sigh(892,8) fiend
shapes before me, capering half in smoke and(18,9)(468,6)these at
last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon(367,6)began to yield to
that unaccountable drows(212,6)which ever would come over me at a
midnight helm.

But(592,6)(809,7)in particular, a strange (and(91,6)since inexplicable)
thing occurred(564,6). Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was
horribly conscious of some(92,6)fatally wrong(436,6)jaw-bone tiller
smote my side,(270,7)leaned against it;(368,7)ears was the low hum of
sails, ju(432,6)inning to shake i(1001,6)wind; I thought my eyes were
open;(216,6)(545,6)(212,13)putting my fingers to(134,6)ids and
mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all
this, I could see no compas(715,11) to steer by;(206,7) it(1024,7)
but a minute(505,7)I had been wa(152,10) card, by(978,6)teady binnacle
lamp illuminating it. No(568,6)(109,6)(149,11)(119,6)jet gloom, now and
then mad(972,8)y by flashes of(1020,8). Uppermost(483,9)impression,(839,6)what(721,6)wift, rus(357,7)ing I stood on was not so much bound to
any haven ahead as(69,9)(754,6)ll(32,6)s astern. A stark, bewildered
feeling, as of death, ca(956,10). Convulsively my hands grasped the
(773,6), but with(405,6)razy concei(1001,7)th(817,8) was, somehow, in
some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what i(825,6)matter(113,6)me?
(784,8)I. Lo!(875,7)(1016,7)leep(575,7)turned myself about, and was
front(599,8)ship’s stern,(104,7)y back to her pr(541,6)(646,6)(737,6). In
an instant I faced back(988,7)in ti(769,6)preven(283,6)vessel(448,6)flying
up in(931,7)wind(170,6)very probably capsizing her. How glad and how
grateful the relief(548,6)this unnatural hallucination of the nigh(288,6)
the fatal c(293,6)ency of being br(383,6)(903,7)lee!

Look not too long in (73,6)ce(100,8)fire, O man! Never dream(588,8)y

glorious, golden,(577,6)sun(91,6)only true lamp—all(88,6)s but liars!

Nevertheles(929,6)sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome’s

in him(57,18)cannot be true—not true, or undeveloped. With

CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.

Had you descended from the Pequod’s try-works (368,7)(26,8)
forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
moment you would have almost(201,7)(30,7)ere (818,9)(547,7)
illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors(707,8)they lay(429,7)ir triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a
score of lamps flashing(421,6)his hooded eyes.

In merchantmen, oil(884,9)sailor is more scarce(511,6)the milk of
queens. To dress(714,8)dark(775,6)eat(21,18)stum(760,6)

seeks the food of light, so he lives in(22,6). He make(95,6)berth an
Aladdin’s lamp(967,6)lays him(1011,8) it(843,10)(952,7)pitchiest night

burns, too,(289,6)urest of oil,(326,6)s unmanufactured, and,(94,6)fore,
unviti(859,6)tate; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral
contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He

genuineness, even a(678,6)traveller o(580,7)rairie(107,7)up(106,6)wn

CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.

Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
descried fr(646,7)mast-head; how he is chased over(926,6)atery moors,
and slaughtered(822,8)valleys of the deep(84,12)then towed
alongside and beheaded;(411,6)ow ((324,9)inciple which entitled the
headsman of old (771,7)garments in(54,7)the(100,9) was killed) his
(301,6)padded surtout becom(799,6) property of his executioner; how, in
due time,(320,8)ondemne(150,9)pot(895,6), like Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego, his spermaceti,(872,6)and bone pass unscathed through the
fire;—but now it remains to conclude the last chapt(654,6)this part of
(449,6)scription by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding
of decanting of(323,6)oil in(432,7)cask(917,6)striking them down(38,9)
hold, where once again(741,11)retur(230,6)his native profundities,
sliding along beneat(543,6)surface as before; but, alas! never more to
ris(696,7)low.

While still warm, the(432,6)like hot punch, is received(219,10)six-barrel(268,6)(775,6)while, perhaps(84,6)ship is pitching and rolling
this way and that(919,8)midnight sea(156,6)enormous(380,8)re slewed
round(903,6)(815,6)over, end for end(645,6)sometimes perilously scoot
acros(827,6)slippery deck(761,7)so many land slides, till at last
man-handle(138,6)stayed(206,7)ir course(294,6)all (180,6)the hoops, rap,
rap, go as(112,6)hammers as can play upon them, for now, _ex officio_,
every sailor is a cooper.

At length, whe(363,6)last pint i(349,6)e(304,7)all is cool, t(47,7)
great hatchway(393,6)unsealed(582,6)bowels(926,6)(512,7)are thrown open,
and(813,6)g(849,12)(862,6)ir final res(529,9)sea. This done,(864,6)atche(524,6)replac(187,8)hermetically closed(729,7)a(15,6)t walled up.

I(100,7)perm fishery, this is(719,8) one(213,8)most remarkable
incidents in all(264,6)usiness of whaling. One day the planks stream
with freshets of bloo(728,6)oil; (503,6) sacred quarter-deck(796,9)
masse(379,9)whale’s head are profanely piled; (461,6)rusty(856,7)lie
about, a(206,6) brewery yard;(980,6)moke from the try-works has besooted
(264,10)lwarks(60,6)mariners go about suffused with unctuousnes(50,6)
entir(585,7)seems(183,7)leviathan himself; while o(388,6)hand(980,6)din
is deafening.

But a day or two after, you look(156,7)you(781,6)prick your ears(986,6)is
self-sam(745,6)(993,6)were it not for(292,6)ell-tale boats and(312,10),
you woul(886,6)but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel,(313,6)a
most scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured(757,7)oil
possesses a singularly cleansing virtue(903,7)i(347,6)reason why the
decks never(327,6)so white as just(360,6) what they call an affair of
oil. Besides,(614,10)ash(731,10)burned scrap(752,14), a
potent lye is readily made(417,7)he(163,6)any adhesiveness(724,10)back
(840,12) remains clinging to(913,6)ide, tha(113,6)quickly
exterminates it. Hands go diligently along(805,13)(622,6)with
buckets of water and rags restore them(135,7)ir full tidiness(492,6)soot
is brushed(947,10)lower rigging. A(939,7)numerous implements which
have been in use are likewise faithful(559,9)ed(822,6)ut away. The
(951,6)hatch is scrubb(42,8)laced upon(816,6)(796,9) completely
hidi(305,7)pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in
unseen nooks(530,10) by the combin(194,7)simultaneous industry of
almost the entire ship’s company,(659,7)ole(693,6)is conscientious duty

immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leap(604,7)
ou(275,6)daintiest Holland.

Now, with elated step, they pace(471,6)lanks in twos and three(793,6)
humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpet(846,7)fine cambrics;
propose to ma(175,7)eck; think of having ha(1001,13)top; object not
to taking tea by moonlight (709,7)piazza(511,6)e forecastle. To hint to
such musked mariners of oil(191,6)bone(10,7)lubber, were little short
of audacit(877,6)y know no(675,6)thing you distantly allude to. Away(353,6)bring us napkins!

But mark: alo(606,6)re, (315,7)three mast heads, st(438,9) men intent

CHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.

Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in
the multiplicity of(510,6)(932,6)s requiring narration(189,8)not been

But one morning, turning(800,6)s(212,6)d(869,7)(159,6)eemed to be newly
attracted by(261,6)(563,6) figures and inscriptions stamp(492,6)it, as

Now this(477,9) was of purest, virgin gold, rake(286,6)where out of

the white whale’s talisman. Sometime(877,7)talk(56,6)over(120,7) weary

are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems
almost to derive an added(46,9)nes(1011,6)enhancing glories, by

Bef(577,6)is(441,8)ial coin, Ahab, not unobserv(358,6)others, was now
pausing.

“No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’s claws must
have left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to
himself, leaning agains(752,6)bulwarks. “The old(303,6)eems to read

earthly symbol. So in(775,6)vale of Death, God girds us round; and over

CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.

The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meet(936,6)Samuel Enderby, of London.

“Ship, ahoy! Hast se(462,6)(717,12)?”

So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,
bearing(718,6)unde(471,7)tern. Trumpet to mout(479,7)(572,6)n was
standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revea(1004,6)
(117,6)ranger captain, who was carelessly reclin(114,11)own boat’s
bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of
sixty (737,6)reabouts, dress(789,6)a spacious roundabout, that hung(22,6)
him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of(931,6)jacket
streamed behind him like the broidered(58,8)a hussar’s surcoat.

“(580,29)“See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds(233,7)ad hidden it,
he held up a white(205,8)sperm whale bone, terminat(568,7)a wooden
head(220,6)a mallet.

“Man my boat!”(751,13)impetuously, and tossing about(684,6)ars near
him—“Stand by to lower!”

In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
crew were dropped to the water(159,6)were soon alongside(494,6)e
(764,8). But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the
excitement(83,7) moment, Ahab had forgotten(682,6)sinc(582,6)loss of his
leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his
own(400,7)hen it(913,6)lways by an ingenious and very handy mechanical
contrivance peculiar(341,8)Pequod(501,6)a thing not to be rigged and
shipp(950,7)ny other(182,11)a(294,7)’s warning. Now, it is no very
easy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly us(523,6)it,
like(777,6)men—to clamber(821,6)ship’s side(881,6)a boat o(950,6)open sea;
for the great swells now lif(758,6)boat high up towards(25,6)ulwarks,
(415,10)nstantaneously drop it half way down(717,8)kelson. So,
deprived of one leg(502,9) (720,7) ship of course being altogether
unsupplied with(101,6)indly invention(707,7)now found himself abjectly
reduc(883,6)a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain
changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.

It has before been hinted, perhaps,(874,6)every little un(401,6)
circumsta(903,6)at befell him(831,6)which indirectly sprang(542,6)his
luckless mishap,(636,8)invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And
i(609,6)present(529,7)ce, all this was(278,7)ened by(484,6)ight of the
two officers(20,7)(517,13), leaning ove(704,6)side,(77,7)
perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there(1015,6)swinging(736,9)him a
pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes;(968,6)t first they did not seem
to bethink them(457,6)a one-legg(76,6) must be too much of a cripple to
use their sea bannisters. But(349,6)awkwardness only lasted a minute,
beca(73,7)(857,9)captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,
cried out, “I see, I see!—avast heav(791,7)re! Jump, boys(368,11)
(445,9)cutting-tackle.”

As good luck w(826,7)ve it,(352,6)had had a whale alongside a day or two

T(763,8)quickly lower(37,6)Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,
slid his solitary thigh in(106,7)curve(817,8)hook (it was like sitting(932,8)fluke of an anchor, o(401,7)rot(641,7)n a(640,6)ree)(327,9)n

hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon on(231,9)running
parts(252,8)(585,7) Soon he was car(964,6) swung insid(776,6)high
bulwark(674,7)gently lande(117,7)the capstan head. With his ivory arm
frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other(886,8) advanced(795,6)Ahab,
p(786,6) ou(284,6)(97,6)leg(832,6)cross(383,8)(125,9) (like two
sword-fish blades) (947,9) in (654,6)lrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let
us shake bones together!—an arm(481,6) leg(18,9)that never can

“T(34,14),” sai(1009,6)Englishman, pointing(437,14) towards
the E(698,9)taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a
telescope; “there I saw him, (580,7)Line, last season.”

“And he took(325,6)arm off, did he?” aske(545,7) now sliding down from

yarn.”

The professional(182,13)us familiarly pointed out, had been all
the time standi(583,7) them, with nothing specific visible, to denote
his(308,10)ly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but
sober one; h(43,6)dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shir(466,6)
patched trowsers(845,6)had(277,8)r(253,6)divid(789,8)attention between
a marlingspike he held in one hand(1024,7) pill-box(33,9)the other,
occa(413,6)ly casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs(492,7) two
crippled(610,8)s. But, at(957,6)uperior’s introduction of him to Ahab,
he politely bowe(193,7)straightway went on to do his(725,8)’s bidding.

“It(457,6) shocking bad wound,” beg(824,6) whale-(765,7); “and, taking my
advice, C(825,6) Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”

“Samuel Enderby is the name(1010,6) ship,” interrupted(401,6)ne-armed
(936,7), addressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”

“S(132,18) off to(117,6)orthward, to get ou(933,8) blazing
hot weather there o(546,6)Line. But i(335,6)no use—I did all I could; sat
up(910,6)him nights; was very severe(33,10)(645,7)matter of diet—”

“Oh,(51,12)!” chim(867,6)the patient himself; then suddenly
alter(821,8)voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies(177,6)me every(182,6), till

and(394,6)dieteticall(407,8), is Dr. Bunger. ((9,6), you dog, laugh
out! why don’t ye? You know you’re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave
ahead, boy, I’d r(638,6)be killed by you than kept alive by any other
man.”

“My (817,9)you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said the
imperturbable godly-looking(279,7), slightly bowing to Ahab—“is apt to
be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things(914,6)at sort. But
I may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I myself—that
is to say, Jack(201,9)late(117,6)e reverend clergy—am a strict total
abstinence man; I never drink—”

“Water!” cried the(402,8); “he(47,12)s it; it’s a sort of fits to
him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with
the arm story.”

“Yes, (339,13),” (507,8) surgeon, coolly. “I was(948,7)observing,
sir, before C(627,6) Boomer’s(503,11)interruption,(473,7)pi(370,6)my

the truth was, sir, it(183,6)s ugly gap(59,6)und as(231,8) ever saw;
more(868,6)two fee(152,11)al inches long. I measured it with the lead

came. But I had no hand in shipping(806,6)ivory arm there;(828,6)thing is

that club-hammer(176,6) put (717,7)end, to knock some one’s brains out
with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies(811,6)diabolical
passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir”—removing his hat, and
brushing aside(28,7)ir(449,6)exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,
but which bore not(898,6)lightest scarry trace, or any token of ever
having been a(813,6)—“Well(830,6)(443,7)(364,7)will tell you how tha(620,6) (573,6)he knows.”

“No, I don’t,” sai(486,8)ptain, “but his mother did; he was born with
it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger!(783,7)ere(918,7)uch another

“What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
impatiently listening(782,6)is by-play betwee(249,6)two Englishmen.

“Oh!”(107,7)the one-armed(423,11)oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we
didn’t see him again for(903,6)time; in fact, as I before hinted, I(67,8)then know what whale it(478,7)at had (359,7)me(486,7) trick,
till(115,10)(171,6)wards(478,7)coming back(296,6)e Line, we heard about
Moby Dick—a(1002,6) call him—and(164,6)I knew(155,8)he.”

“Did’st thou cross his wake(276,6)?”

“Twic(47,6)But could not faste(35,6)D(336,6)want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What(648,8)I do without

bow(754,7)each C(691,6) in succession—“(94,22),(590,6)the

even a man’s(436,10)he knows it too. So(781,6)what you tak(90,6)the
White Whale’s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to(501,8) a singl(626,6); he(70,6)thinks to terrify by feints. But
sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of

“Bless my soul(977,6)cur(758,7)foul fiend’s,” cried(681,8) stoopingly
walking round Ahab(939,6)like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man’s
blood—bring the thermometer!—it’s(397,7) boiling point!—his pulse makes

CHAPTER 101. The Decanter.

Er(420,6)(641,8)ship fades(823,6)sight, be it set down here, that she

far behi(518,7)united royal(108,6)s(352,8)Tudors and Bourbons, in point
of real historical interest. How long, prior(528,8)year of our Lord
1775, this great(246,15)was in existence, my numerous
fish-documents do not make plain; but(772,6)at(124,6)(1775) it fitted out
the first(548,13)s(510,6)ever regularly hunt(927,7)Sperm Whale;
though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant
Coffin(371,6)Maceys of Nantucket(955,9)Vineyard had in large fleets
pursued(701,6)Leviathan, but only(274,6)e North and South Atlantic: not
elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded(806,12)the(169,10)ers were(347,11)among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the(529,7)Sperm

m(232,6)only knows—and under(34,6) immediate auspices(530,6)partly, I
think,(622,7)ir expense(692,6)British government was induced to send the
sloop-of-war Rattler on(595,7)ing(552,8)of discovery into the(596,6)
Sea. Command(458,6)a naval Post-Captain(848,6)(100,8)made a rattling

That ship—well called the “Syren”—(262,7)noble experimental(98,7); and

the present day; though doubtles(1017,6)original(883,8)must long ago
have slipped his cable for(313,11)South Sea (493,6) (917,6)world.

Th(523,6) named after him was worthy(57,8)honor, being a very fast
sailer and(483,9)craft e(624,6)ay. I boarded her once at midnight
somewhere of(167,6)Patagonian coas(812,8)rank good flip dow(476,7)e

soul on(174,6). A short lif(774,8)m(950,6)a jolly death. And(691,6)fine
gam I had—long,(300,6)(440,6)fter old Ahab touch(277,7)planks with his
ivory heel—it minds me(455,8)noble, solid, Saxon hospitalit(437,7)at
ship; and may my parson forget me(275,9) devil remember me, if I ever
lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say(354,7) flip? Yes(434,6)we f(675,7)it
(980,7)rat(201,6)en gallon(752,6)hour(173,6)when the squall came (for it’s

dow(517,6)(987,10) scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to
my taste.

The beef was fine—tough, but(890,6)body in it. They said it was
bull-beef; others(238,6)(31,7) dromedary (36,6)but I do not know, for
certain, how(599,7)as(110,7)had dumplings too; small(162,6)substantial,
symmetrically globular(975,6)indestructible(82,10). I fancied(424,6)you could feel them(952,6)rol(15,6) about in you after they were
swallowed. If you stooped ov(414,7)far forward, you risk(773,6)ir
pitching out o(67,6)like billiard-ball(287,6) bread—but(910,6)couldn’t be
helped; besides,(404,8)an anti-scorbutic; in short(758,6)bread

light(388,7)(533,6)very easy to step(282,6)into a dark corner when you
ate it(109,6)all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the
dimensions of the cook’s boilers, including his own live parchment

good(329,6)and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows(247,6)and
capital(248,6)boot heels to hat-band.

But wh(134,6)it, think ye(935,7)(176,18)(814,6)some(977,6)
English whalers I know of—no(397,6)though—were such famous, hospitable

will tell you(841,6)abounding good cheer(549,7)se (261,16)is
matter for historical research. Nor have I been a(698,6)sparing of

(110,7)(104,7)(406,7)hat is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching
(765,6) to eat(440,10). For, as a general thing(869,6)(662,7)
merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but(550,7)(55,12)(717,7). Hence,(203,8)(747,7), this(110,6) of whal(537,15)is not normal and
natural, but incident(28,6) particular; and, therefore, must(552,6)some
special origin, which is here pointed out(936,6)will be(409,7)further
elucidated.

During my(668,9)es(554,8)Leviathanic(709,8)es, I stumbled upon an
ancient Dutch volume(158,7),(611,8)musty(302,9)smell of it, I knew
must b(877,6)t(845,8)(896,6)title was, “Dan Coopman,” w(301,8) I

cooper(814,8)(808,7), as ever(194,6)e ship(414,6)carry its (58,6). I was
reinforc(890,8)is opinion by seeing(168,6)it was the production of one
“Fitz Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learn(927,6),
professor of Low(424,7)and High German(503,8)college of Santa Claus
and St. Pott’s, to whom I han(372,6)e work for translation, giving him a
box of sperm candles for his trouble—this same(222,15)so soon as
he spi(120,7)book, assured me(513,6)(555,12)” did not mean “The
Cooper,” but “The Merchant.” In short(1008,7)(739,8)and(349,9)Low

subjects, contained(452,8)interesting account(818,6)s(645,7)(669,7).
An(613,10)chapter(598,7), headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,”(806,6)I found a
long detailed list(203,8)outfit(423,6)the larders and cella(842,6)180
sail of(611,7)whalemen; from which list, as(549,9)ed by(712,14)
I(579,6)cri(957,7)following:

fish. 5(28,15)biscuit. 72(52,14)oft bread. 2,800 firkins

pipes,(160,8), quarts, and gills of good gin(22,6)ood ch(198,6)At the time, I devoted three days to the studious dig(817,7)of all this
beer, beef(123,6)bread, during(661,7)many pro(781,6)thoughts were
incidentally suggested to me, capable of a(693,7)en(47,6) and Platonic
application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary(444,8)of my
own, touching (419,6)obable quantity(736,9)-fish, etc., consumed by
every Low(935,7)harpooneer(527,6)at ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen
whale fishery. I(584,6)first place, the amount (803,9)(510,6)(795,6)and
(797,13)(166,9), seems amazing. I impute it,(415,7),(511,7)ir
naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more(44,10)by the(70,6)e of(86,6) vo(430,6)(689,6)especially(48,7)ir pursu(393,7)ir game
in those frigid Polar Seas, o(877,6)very coasts(110,6)at Esquimaux

Th(540,14)(783,6)too, is(140,6)large, 10,800(944,8). Now, as(208,6)
polar(497,7)ies could only be prosecuted(580,6)e short summer(231,8)

includ(766,8)(101,6)voyage to and from the(687,12) sea, did not
much exceed three months, say(674,6)reckoning 30 men to(367,7)(543,7)
fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400(865,11)seamen in all; theref(1014,6)
say(57,10)precisely two(393,8)(437,8) per man, for a twelve weeks’

Now, whether(386,7)gin and(132,6)harpooneers, so fuddled as one might
fancy them to(275,6)been, w(723,8)right sort of(352,8)stand up in a

somewhat improbable. Yet they di(72,9)them(997,6)hi(14,6) too. But
(85,6)a(809,7)far North, be it remembered,(945,7)beer agrees well with
(967,7)stitution; upo(808,6)Equator, in our southern(875,7)y,(509,6)would
be apt to mak(331,6)(402,10) sleepy(211,7) mast-head(446,6)oozy in his
boat; and grievous loss(447,6) ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.

But no more; enough has been said to show(1000,10)old(975,12)rs of
two or(903,7)centuries ago(558,6)high livers(178,6)(79,9)English
(77,8)have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when
cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out(851,6)e
world, get a(684,6)dinn(36,10)it, at least. And(694,6)empties the

CHAPTER 102. A Bower i(568,6)Arsacides.

Hitherto, in descriptively treating(162,7) Sperm Whale, I(925,6)chiefly
dwelt(666,10)marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and(123,6)tail
upon some few interior structural features. But to a large(482,7)orough
sweeping comprehension(144,6)m, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
further(996,6)untagging the point(227,9)hose, unbuckling his garters,
and casting loos(896,7)ooks(666,7)e eyes(363,8)j(92,13)innermost
bones, set him before you(927,7) ultimatum;(829,6)is to say,(961,8)unconditional skeleton(919,7)how now, Ishmael? How is it,(910,6)you, a mere oarsman(599,7)
fishery, pretend to know aught abou(974,6)subterranean par(326,6)the(913,6)? Did erudite Stubb, mounted(611,6)your capstan, deliver lectures
(645,7)anatomy(703,8)Cetacea; and by help(731,8)windlass, hold up a
specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself(305,9). Can you land a
full-grown whale (191,8)deck(87,7)amination, as a cook dishes a
roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness(915,6)you h(982,7) been,
(462,7); but(952,6)a care how you seiz(660,6)privilege of Jonah alone;
(30,17)discoursing(1018,10)joist(725,6)beams; the raf(777,6)ridge-pole, sleepers(861,8)der-pinnings, mak(89,6) the frame-work of
leviathan(461,7)elike(828,8)tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butterie(114,6)
cheeseries(830,8)bowels.

I confess(758,7)since(271,6), few(460,6)men(371,6)penetrated very far
beneath(753,6)kin(987,8)adult(524,6); nevertheless, I(449,6)been blessed
with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged
to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the(680,10)his
poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barb(978,8) harpoon(485,7)(35,7)
head(35,9)lances. Think you I let(378,6)chance go, without using my
boat-hatchet and jack-knife(596,6)bre(582,6)the seal and reading all the
content(179,7)at young cub?

And a(220,6)my exact knowled(804,6)the bone(207,10)(669,8) in their
gigantic, full grown development,(316,7)at rare(97,11)I am indebted
to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of(17,7)e, on(792,9)Arsacides.
For being at(44,10)years ago, when attach(522,10)trading-ship Dey
of Algiers, I was invi(572,7)spend part(129,16)an holidays with
the lord(186,13)at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side
glen not(899,9) distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his
capital.

Among many other fine qualities, my(392,23)(349,6)gift(963,9) devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought
together in(251,8) whatever(562,6)things the more ingenious of(954,6)eople could invent; chiefly carved woo(918,6)wonderful devices,
chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and
(883,7)se distributed among(209,10)natural(134,7)s, the
(147,6)-freighted, (63,7)-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.

Chief(111,7)(135,6)latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
unusually long raging gale(434,7)een found dead and stranded, with his
head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings
seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last(162,6)stripped of
its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry i(104,6)sun,
t(118,8)skeleton was carefully transported up the(714,9)glen, where
a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.

The ribs were hung(359,6)trophies;(268,6)ertebræ(38,6)(752,8)ith
Arsacidean anna(730,6)(436,6)ge hieroglyphics;(242,9)kull, the priests
kept up an unextinguished(777,10)flame, so that(940,6)ystic (527,10)
sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough(808,6)terrific lower jaw vibrated over (899,7) devotees, like the hair-hung
sword(167,6)so affr(886,6) Damocles.

It(823,7)wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen;
the trees stood high and haughty, feeli(946,6)ir living sap; the
industrious earth beneath(981,6)s a weaver’s loom(902,7)a gorgeous
carpet on it(648,7)(166,7)ground-vine tendrils forme(791,6)warp and
woof(814,10)(163,7)flowers the figures. A(383,7)trees(140,8)(403,6)ir

message-carrying air(66,9)se unceasingly(812,6)active. Through the
lacing(423,9)leaves(746,6)great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving
the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy(400,7)! unseen(15,8)—pause!—one
word!—whither flow(327,7)abric? what palace may it deck?(446,6)fore all
(249,6)ceaseless toilings? Speak,(123,9)stay thy hand!—but one singl(142,6)(566,6)thee! Nay—(406,6)(248,6)flies—(487,11) float(926,6)(972,6)the
loom;(526,6)reshet-rushing (642,7)for ever slides away(847,7)eaver-god,
(15,8)s; and by(936,6)(381,7) is he deafened,(965,6)he hears no mortal
voice(67,14)humming, we, too, who look on(730,6)oom ar(96,10);
and only when we escape it shall w(124,6)(758,6)housand voices(186,6)speak

are plainly hea(507,7)out(1011,7)lls, bursting(484,6)the opened
casement(153,6)reby have villainies been detected. Ah,(404,7)! then, be
heedful; for so,(257,8)this din(929,8)(917,6)world’s loom, thy
subtlest thinkings may be over(215,6)afar.

Now, amid(998,8)en, life-restles(88,6)(114,6)at Arsacidean wood, the
great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet,
a(998,6)ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
him, the mighty(97,6) seeme(227,6)cunning(1021,7); himself all (118,6)over
(1009,8) vines; every month assuming(303,6)er,(979,7)r verdure; but

skull an altar(125,6)the artificial smoke ascend(801,9)where the real
jet had issued, I marvelled(958,6)the king should regard a chapel as an
object of vertu. He laughed. But more(93,22)priests
(96,7)swear(735,6)smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced
before(922,6)(750,8)—brush(624,7)vines aside—broke throug(606,6)ribs—and(624,6)a ball of(871,12)twine, wandered, eddied long(954,6)its many
winding, shaded colonnades and arbours(286,6)soon my line was out; and
following it back, I emerged(465,6)the ope(840,6)here I entered. I saw no
living thing within; naught w(1005,6)re but bones.

Cutting me a(861,6) measuring-rod, I once(475,6)d(790,9)in(672,7)(871,8)F(166,7)ir arrow-slit (39,6) skull,(521,12) perceived me
tak(184,6)e altitude of the final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st
thou(191,7)(544,7)our god! That’s for us.” “Aye,(662,8)—well, how long
do ye make him, then?” But hereupon a fierce contest rose amo(200,6)m,
concerning feet and inches;(192,6)cracked each other’s sconces with
(336,6)yard-sticks—the great(340,6) echoed—and seiz(510,6)at lucky chance,
I quickly concluded my own ad(305,7)ments.

These(23,15) I now propose to set (905,7)you(1022,6)first, be it
recorded, that,(522,6)is matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
(153,11) I please. Because(716,7)are (645,8) authorities you can
refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museu(506,6)y tell
me, in Hull, England, on(681,9)whaling ports(702,6)at country,(949,6)
they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and(533,6) whales. Likewise,
I(68,6)heard(496,6)(873,7)museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire(216,6)
have what(921,7)oprietors call “the only perfect(170,9) of a
Greenland or River Whale(1013,8)United States.” Moreover, at a place in
York(151,7)(344,9)Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford
(42,10)has in his possessio(285,6)(552,9)of a Sperm(178,6), but of
moderate size, by no mea(412,6)the full-grown magnitude of my friend
King Tranquo’s.

In both cases,(138,6)tranded(475,7) to which these two(725,9)s
belonged, were originally claimed by their(452,13)upon similar
grounds. (158,12) seizing his b(855,7)he wanted it; and Sir
(360,8),(40,14)s lord(770,8)seignorie(767,7)ose parts.(68,13)’s(722,6) has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great
chest of drawers,(1004,8) open and shut him, in all(226,6)ony
cavities—spread out his ribs(103,9)igantic fan—and swing all day upon
his lower jaw. Locks are to be put(385,7)ome of his trap-doors and
shutters(358,6)a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of
keys a(199,6)side.(794,13) thinks of charging twopence for a peep
at the whispering gallery(975,8)spinal column; three(70,6)to hear the
echo(50,8)hollow(254,8)cerebellum(599,6)six(133,10)the unrivalled
view from his forehead.

T(967,12)dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
verbatim(96,6)my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
wanderings at that period, ther(796,6)no other secure way of preserving
such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished
the(104,7)parts of my body to remain a blank pag(503,9)oem(97,7)then
composing—at least, what un(263,8)(98,7)might(90,7)—I did not
trouble myself(680,6)the odd inches; nor, indeed, shoul(28,8) at all
enter into a congenial admeasurement of(686,7)ale.


CHAPTER 103. M(41,14)The Whale’s S(572,7).

I(727,6)first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
statement, touching the living bulk(168,6)is leviathan, whos(709,10)
we are briefly to exhibit. Such a (104,9) may prove useful here.

According (309,6)areful calculation I have mad(573,8)hich I partly base
upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons(956,9)largest sized
Greenl(102,6)ale of sixty feet in length; a(185,12)my(186,8)
(186,11), I say, a Sperm(459,6)(513,8)(120,8)magnitude, between
eighty-five and nine(131,17)(841,6)something less than forty
(177,8)its fullest circumference, s(422,6)(234,6)will weigh (837,8)
(121,7)tons; so that, reckon(564,6)irteen men(449,6)ton, he would
considerably out(95,6)the combined pop(489,8)of a whole village of one
thousand one hundred inhabitants.

Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle(964,9)be put to
(752,16)to make him(995,7) budge to any landsman’s imagination?

Having already in various ways put(930,12)his skull, spout-hole,
jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins(781,6)divers other parts, I shall now
simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
unobstructed bones. But as(461,7)lossal(198,6) embraces so very(867,6) a
propor(492,8)the entire extent(794,8)skeleton; as it is by far the
most complicated part; and as no(782,6)is to be repeated concerning it
in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under
your arm, as we proceed,(399,6)wis(481,6)will not gain a(190,6)ete notion
(269,7)(378,8)(362,6)ure we are about to view.

In length, the Sperm Whale’s(318,9) at Tranque measured seventy-two
feet(982,9) when fully invested and(411,6)ded in life, he(297,6)have
been ninety feet long; for(592,8)whale(169,6)(155,9)loses(215,7)one
fifth i(215,8) compared with the living body. Of(445,6)(206,16),(843,10) and jaw comprised some twen(171,7), le(936,6)some fifty
feet of plain back-bone. Attached to(570,6)(28,9), for some(635,6)less
than a third of its(436,9)w(823,7)mighty circular bask(126,6)ribs
which once enclosed his vitals.

To me(711,6)vast ivory-ribbed chest,(321,11)ong, unrelieved spine,
(480,6)ing far away from(757,7)a straight line, not a little resembled
the hull of a great ship new-laid upo(528,6)stocks,(625,6)only some
(409,7)of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is(877,10),
for the time, but a(250,7)disconnected timber.

The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin(284,6)the neck, was
nearly six(770,12)the second,(518,6)(184,6)fourth(111,6)each
successively longer, till you came(626,6)e climax of th(687,6)h, or one
(21,7)middl(210,6), (576,6)(1019,9)eight(932,6)an(782,7)inches. From
that part(941,6)remaining(289,6)diminished(159,7)the tenth and last only
spanned five(111,23)In general thickness, they all bore
a seemly correspondenc(269,8)ir(846,7)(422,6)(248,11)(458,7)he most
arched. In(1024,6)(318,7)Arsacides(118,7)re used for beams whereon to lay
footpath bridges over small streams.

In considering thes(398,8)I could not but be struck anew(936,9)
circumstance, so variously repeated in(1014,6)book, that(858,6)keleton of
the whale is by no means(282,7)uld of his invest(252,6)m(757,6)largest(72,8)Tranqu(599,8)on(326,9)(623,7)ones, occupied(144,6)part(683,7)
fish(654,6), in life, is greatest in depth. Now(638,6)(28,9)depth(210,8)(172,9)body(778,6)is particular(243,7)must have been at least
sixteen feet;(482,6)a(633,6)(614,11)(754,7)(825,10)but little more
than(846,11). So(388,8)is rib only conveyed half(950,8)true notion(948,8)living magnitud(675,7)(907,7). Besides, for(949,6)way,(671,6) I
now saw but a naked spine, all(540,6)had(265,6)once wrapped round with
tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for
the ample fins, I here(160,11)few disordered joints; and in place(701,9)eighty and majestic,(826,6)oneless flukes, an utter blank!

How vain and foolish, then, thought I(338,6)timid untravelled man to try
to comprehend arigh(486,7)wondrous(868,6), by merely poring over his
dead attenuated(933,9), stretch(976,11)peaceful wood. No. Only in
the he(853,7)quickest perils;(625,6)when within the eddyings(1001,7)
angry(309,7)(51,7)o(42,6)profound unbounded sea, ca(74,6)fully
(893,9)(869,6)be trul(418,6)(709,6)ly (72,6)out.

But the(656,6). For that(993,6)best way we can consider it is, with a
crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now
it’s done, it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar.

There are for(646,7)odd vertebræ in all, which(449,6)e(476,9) are not
locked together. They mostly lie(127,6)the great knobbed blocks on a
Gothic spi(871,7)ming solid course(482,6)eavy masonry. The largest, a
middle (257,6)s in width something less than three feet(1006,6)in depth
more(35,6)fou(205,6) smallest, wher(204,6)spine tapers away into the
tail, is(690,6)two inche(146,10)(115,6)(417,6)(157,11)ike a white
billiard-ball. I was told that there were still(163,7)r ones, b(661,6)y
had been lost by some little cannibal urchins(692,6)priest’s children,
who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how(173,9)
(303,6)of ev(66,6) hugest of(856,7) things(339,8)off at last into
simple(150,6)’s play.


CHAPTER 104(529,6)Fossil Whale.

From his mighty bulk the(993,7)affords a most congenial theme(496,6)on
to enlarge, amplify(568,6)generally expatiate. Would you, you could not
compress him. By good rights he should(568,6)be treated of in imperial
folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to (668,6)and
the yards he measures abo(572,6) waist;(708,7)hink of(966,6)igantic
involution(925,6)is intestines(812,11)y lie in him(742,6)great cables
and hawsers coiled(848,8)(873,6)ubterranean orlop-deck of a
line-of-battle-ship.

Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to
approve myself omnisciently exhaustive(168,8)enterprise; not
overlook(731,6)e minutest seminal germ(313,9)blood(595,6)spinning him
ou(485,6)he utter(678,7)il(57,9)owels. Having already described him
in(735,6)(422,7)present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now
remains(328,6)gnify him in an archæological, fossiliferous(626,6)antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the
(432,9)—to an ant or a flea—such portly term(1013,7) just(850,6)deemed
unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when(541,10) is the text, the case
is altered. Fain am I to stagger(441,6)is empris(651,7)(861,6)eightiest
words(860,8)dictionary. And here be it said, tha(158,6)ever it has been
convenient to consult on(673,9)course(966,7)se dissertations,(815,7)
invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased
for(171,6)purpose; because(193,6)famous lexicographer’s uncommon personal
bulk more fitt(718,6)(223,6)mpile a(68,7)n to be(179,6)by a whale author
like me.

One often hears of writers(347,6)rise(902,6)well with their subject,
though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then,(71,6)me, writing of
this(611,10)? Unconsciously my chir(285,6)y expands into placard
capitals. Give me a condor’s quill!(26,9)Vesuvius’ crater for an
inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For(577,8)mere act of penning my(272,7)t(708,7)(213,12), they weary me, and make me faint(353,11)

But by far(387,7)st wonderful of all(721,10)relics was the(292,7)

When I stand among these mighty(1022,10)(928,9)s, skulls, tusks,

in all the 25,000 mile(689,7)is world’s circumference, not an

for them an almost fossiliferous character, we fi(629,7)unmist(387,6)

fifty years ago, there was discovere(1020,7)(78,6)anite ceiling a
sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins,

Nor must(342,7)be omitted another strange attestation(855,8)(577,9)(217,8)(872,7)in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by
the venerable John Le(499,6) old Barbary traveller.

“Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Templ(20,6) Rafters and Beams
of which are made of Whale-Bones; for(17,6)s of a monstrous size are

that by a secret Power bestowed by Go(752,11)(215,8)no(175,6) can

CHAPTER 105. Does(682,10)’s Magnitude Diminish?—Will He Perish?

Inasmu(566,7)n, as(218,6)Leviathan comes floundering dow(568,7)us(398,8)e head-waters(931,8)Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,
in the long cour(378,6)his generations, he has not de(26,7)ed from the
original bulk(66,8)sires.

Bu(948,7)investigation we find(652,7)not only are the(406,6)(215,8)
present day superior in m(369,9)to those whose fossil remains are
found (242,7)Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period
prior to man), but(683,8)(177,7)(102,11)at(103,16),(164,6)
belonging to its latter form(372,6) exceed in size(220,7)of its earlier
ones.

Of all the pre-adamit(322,9)yet exhumed, by far(500,6)argest is the
Alabama one mention(127,6)(44,6)st chap(823,9)that was less than
seventy feet in length(369,8)skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,
that the tape-measure gives (99,7)-two(103,6)fo(205,6)(94,8) of a
large sized modern(997,6). And I(118,6)heard, o(28,7)men’s authority(136,7)Sperm(991,6)s(173,6)been captured near a hundred(251,6)long (196,6)

(132,16)since Adam’s time they(421,6)(1016,11)?

Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we(972,6)o credi(468,6)accounts of
such gentlemen as Pliny(608,8)e ancient naturalists (133,6)lly. For
Pliny tells us of(903,8)that (980,6)ed acr(338,6)living bulk, and
Aldrovand(62,6)others which (636,7)d eight(485,14)(736,9)—Rope

recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient
look-outs (379,7)mast-hea(682,6)(202,9)-ships, now penetrating even

an inch; in such a c(359,6)son an irresistible argument would seem
furnished, to show th(916,7)hunted(905,6) cannot now escape speedy
extinction.

But you(650,6)look(992,6)is matter in every light. Though so short a
period ago—not a good lifetime—the censu(948,9)(539,7) in(465,9)
exceede(966,6)(47,10)men now in London(770,8)ough(171,6)e present day
not one horn or hoof(120,7)m remains in all(312,6)region;(87,12)the
cause(653,6)is wondrous(925,11)ion was(559,6)pear of man; ye(398,6)far
different natur(82,7)e(954,6)-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious
an end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunt(951,8)Sperm Whales
for(900,6)-eight months think they have done extremely well(375,8)ank
God, if at last(57,6)carry home the oil of(1009,7)fish. Whereas, in the
day(530,9)old Canadian and Indian(721,6)r(1007,6)trapper(582,9)West,
whe(947,6)far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness
and a virgin,(466,6)ame numbe(472,6)occasined men, for(39,19)
(336,6), mo(905,6)on horse instead of sailing in ships,(989,7)have slain
not(423,6), bu(11,7) thousand and mor(839,9)es; a fact that, if need
were, could be statistically stated.

Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour(976,7)
gradual extinction(1002,8)(638,11)(309,6)example,(892,6)in former
years (the latter part(814,8)last century, say) thes(779,11)s, in
small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
consequence(522,6)voyages(80,6)not so prolonged(791,6)were also(100,6)more
remunerative. Because, as has been elsewh(87,7)iced, those whales,
influenced by some views to safety, now swim(694,6)eas in immense
caravans, so(370,6)to a large degre(942,6)scat(293,6)solitaries, yokes,
and(339,7)and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but
widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally
fallacious seems the conceit(587,7)b(354,6)(957,6)o-called(330,6)-bone
(341,6) no longer haunt many grounds(656,10) (656,6)abounding with
them, hence(704,6)species(508,6)is declining. For they are only being
driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast i(180,12)enlivened
with their jets, then, be sure,(558,6)(418,6)and remoter strand(644,9)
very recently startl(623,6)the unfamiliar spectacle.

Furthermore:(391,6)rning(916,7)last mentioned(931,13)they have two
firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
impregnable(566,6)as upon the invasion of(302,7)valley(305,6) frosty
Swiss(153,6)retreated to(352,7)mountains; so, hunted(450,6)the savannas

circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit(741,6)man.

But as perhaps fifty(404,7)s(279,20)are harpooned for one
cachalot(735,7)philosopher(371,9)forecastle(617,6)concluded(946,6)this
positive havoc has already very seriously diminished(876,7)battalions.
But though for(882,6)time past a number(230,15)s, not less than
13,000,(791,6)been annually slain (714,7)nor’ west coast(931,7)
Americans alone; yet(497,6) are considerations(866,6) render even(273,6)circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument i(69,7)matter.

Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness
(837,8)ore enormous creatur(868,10)globe, yet what shall we say to
Harto(1006,6)historian of Goa, when he tells us(549,6)at one hunt(153,7)
King of Siam took 4,000 elephants;(608,6)in those regions(33,10) are
numerous as drov(199,6)cattle(329,6)e temperate climes. And(467,7)seems
no reason to doubt(125,7)(848,8)(150,9),(498,7)have now(609,6)hunted

all Asia, both (868,7)s, Europe and Africa, New Holland(278,6)all the
Isl(678,10)sea combined.

Moreover: w(936,6)to(939,9),(645,6)from(788,6)resumed(260,7)longevity of
whales, their probably attai(853,9)age of a century and more,

CHAPTER 106. Ahab’s Leg.

T(600,6)cipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitte(374,6)Samuel
Enderby of London, had not been unattended with(945,6)small viole(180,6)
his own person. He had light(59,9)uch energy(306,6)a thwart of his
boat tha(283,6)ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when
after gaining (155,8)deck(649,6)(173,9)ivot-hole there, he so
vehemently wheeled roun(258,7)an urgent command(436,9)teersman (it
was, as ever, something ab(508,8)not(52,6)ing inflexibly enough);
then, the already shaken(283,7)(275,9)such an additional twist and
wrench,(344,6)though it (718,6)remained entir(916,8)o all appearances
lusty, yet(589,6)di(547,6)deem it(63,7)ly trustworthy.

And, indeed, it seemed(575,7)matter for wonder(164,7)for all his
pervading, m(517,6)klessness,(138,10)at times give careful hee(411,8)
con(283,6)(916,6)at dead bone(957,6)(817,6)he partly stood. For it(786,8)
been very long prior(946,8)Pequod’s sailing from Nantucket(385,7)he
had(859,6)found one night lying pr(149,9)the ground(696,6)insensible;
by(907,6)unknown(729,6)seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his
(870,7)imb having(1015,6)so(991,7)tly displaced(582,7)(274,7)stake-wise
smitte(134,7)all but pierce(879,6)groin; nor was it without extreme
difficulty(683,8)e agonizing w(896,6)as(619,10)cured.

Nor, (49,7)time, had it fail(515,6)enter his monomaniac min(209,8)all
the anguish(549,9)then present suff(940,6)was bu(163,6)direct issue of
a former woe; and he too plainly(772,8)to see(128,8)s the most
poisonous reptile(691,6)e marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as
the sweetest songster(73,8)grove; so, equally with every felicity,
all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than
(96,7), thought Ahab; since both(487,6)ncestry and posterity of Grief
go further tha(792,6)(52,26)Joy. For, not to hint of
this:(706,9)is an inference(943,6)certain canonic teachings(959,6)
while(889,6)(262,7) enjoyments here shall have no children born to them
for the other world, but, (1014,7)contrary,(79,7)be followed by the
joy-childlessness of all hell’s despair; whereas,(183,6)guilty mortal
miseries(182,7)still fertile(480,10)(182,6)selves an eternally

obvious deduction. To trail(402,6)enealogie(324,8)s(285,6)(540,16), carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitur(86,9)

birth-mark(655,8)brow of man, is but(279,6)tamp of sorrow(702,7)

Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
properly(582,6)et way,(708,6)(67,7)sclosed before. With many other
particulars concerning(828,7)always had it remained(718,7)ery to some,

Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness;(870,6)for(153,6)one interval, sought
speechless refuge, as it were,(751,11)marble senate(173,8)dead.
Captain Peleg’s bruited reason(129,7)is thing appeared by no means
adequate; though, indeed, as touc(59,6)ll Ahab’s deeper part, every
revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory
light. Bu(945,10)end, it all came out;(209,6)one matter did, at least.
That direful mishap was a(805,6)bottom of his temporary recluseness. And
not only this,(869,6)o(616,6)ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore,

to him;(129,9)timid(108,8)the above hinted casualty—(829,6)ing(602,7)
did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested itself(756,6)terrors, not
entirely underived from the land of spirits (15,7)wails. S(322,6),
through their zeal for him, they had(504,6)onspired, so far as(544,7)m
lay, to muffle up the knowled(338,6)(767,11)from other(929,6) hence it

And when(838,6)functionary appeared before(520,6)he bade him without

But(92,6)humble though he wa(131,8)ar from furnishing an example of

Lik(828,6)sea-going ship(926,10)(322,7)more especially(839,6) belonging
to whaling vessels,(255,9)to a c(882,6) off-handed, practical extent,
alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his
ow(303,7)(294,9)’s pursuit bei(682,7)ancient and outbranching trunk
of all(232,7)(130,9)handicrafts which(281,6)or less have to do with
wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides(1015,6)p(630,6)ion(206,6)m(537,8)generic remark above,(459,6)(525,10)of(551,11) was singularly
effi(242,6)in(447,7)thousand nameless mech(982,6) emergencies continually
recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in
uncivilized(795,8)-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in
ordin(940,6)ties:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reform(517,7)
shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s ey(844,6)the deck, or new
tree-nail(31,9)side plank(1024,7)other miscellaneous matters more
directly p(810,6)ing(722,7) (887,7) business;(859,7) moreover
unhesitatingly(833,6)t in all mann(542,6)conflicting aptitudes, both
useful(861,7)pricious.

The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
was(35,6)ice-bench; a long rude pond(999,7)able furnished with several
vices, of different size(359,7)both of iron(987,6)f wood. At(977,6)imes
except when whales were alongsid(860,8)bench(842,6)ecurely lashed
athwartships against the rea(906,9)Try-works.

A belaying pin is found too(837,7)to be easily(637,7)ed into its hole:
the(1010,11)claps it(38,6)one(810,8)ever-ready (306,7)and
straightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage
strays on board(732,6)is made a captive: out(855,6)ean shaved rods of
right-whale bone(801,6)cross-beams of sperm(412,6) ivory, (251,13)
makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprain(643,6)wrist: the
(331,11)oncocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars
(444,6)painted upon the blad(404,13)y oar; screwing each oar in his
big vice(696,8)(246,15) symmetrically supplies(203,6)onstella(180,6)A sailor t(297,7)fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings(275,16)drill(950,6)ears. Another has the toothache:(167,15)out
pincer(920,7)clapping one han(292,7)(868,10)bids him be seated there;
bu(857,6)poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded
operation; whirling r(889,6)h(138,6)l(821,9)wooden vice(622,16)sign(160,6)to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw(299,10).

Thus, this(967,11)was prepared at all point(318,7)alike indifferent
and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of(842,6); heads he
deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly hel(770,6)capstans. But
while now(763,6)so wide a field thus variously accomplished (202,8)
such liveliness of expertness(800,6)m, too; all(323,6)(366,6)seem to argue
som(515,6)mmon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For
n(1023,7)was(426,6)man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal
stolidity as it were;(33,11), I say; for it so shaded off into the
surrounding infinite of things, that it s(457,6)one with the gener(139,13)discernible(696,6)e whole visible world; which while
pauseles(441,6)tive in un(603,8)modes, still eternally holds its peace,
and ignores you, though you dig foundations(609,7)thedrals. Yet was
this half-horrible (360,10)(546,8)involving, too,(384,7)appeared, an
all-ramifying heartlessness;—y(109,6) it oddly da(681,6)t times,(354,6)an
old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked
now and then(91,7)(593,9)grizzled wittiness; such as might have
served to pass the time during the midnight watch o(510,6)bearded
forecastle of Noah’s ark. W(703,6)that(883,6)old carpenter had been a
life-long wanderer, whose much roll(405,7) and fro(267,6)only had
gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubb(808,7)whatever small
outward clinging(293,12) origi(669,6)p(944,6)(307,6)him? He was a
stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born
babe; living without premeditated reference to(346,6)world or the next.
You(488,7)almost say(1013,7)this strange(139,14)ness(782,7)
(781,6)ed a sort of unintelligence; for(828,6)s numerous trades, he did
not seem to work so(469,6)by reason or by instinct, or simply because he
(558,9)tutor(690,6)i(45,6)by any intermixture of all these, even or
uneven(541,6)merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
process.(503,9) pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ev(756,7)one,
mus(604,7)early oozed along into(889,6)uscles of his finger(123,9)
like one of those un(339,6)ing but still highly useful, _multum in
parvo_, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little
swelled—of a common pocket knife(909,6)containing(956,11)blades of
various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,
pens, rulers, nail-fi(13,6)countersinkers. So(412,6)is superiors wanted
to use the carpenter for a(142,13),(610,8)y had to do was to open
that pa(827,6)him, and the(213,6) was fast: or if for(211,11)take him
up by the legs(69,9)re(124,6)were.

Yet, as previously hinted,(1007,6)omnitooled, open-and-shut(228,10),
was, after all, no mere machi(617,6)an automaton. If(1000,7) no(720,7)a
(515,7)soul in(250,6)(773,7)a subtle someth(603,6)at somehow anomalously
did its duty. What(44,6)was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few
drop(834,6)artshorn,(318,7)is no telling. But(25,8)t was;(361,11)it
had abided for now some sixty years or more. And(374,6)(75,6)(387,7)same
unaccountable, cunning life-principle(311,7);(69,16)at kept
him a gre(609,11)the time soliloquizing(892,6)only like an
unreasoning wheel, which(880,6)hummingly(72,11)es; or rather, his
body was a sentry-box(736,7)is(60,12)r on guar(694,7)(774,7)alking
(835,7)(186,6)to keep himself awake.

Dra(97,6)fil(474,7)d(19,8)bone! That is hard(616,7)should be soft(204,6)t(39,7)soft(39,17)hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
shinbones. Let’s try another. Aye, now(908,7)works better (_sneezes_).
Halloa(947,7)bone dust is(39,12)—why it’(21,14)yes it’s
(42,12)bless my soul, it won’t let me speak! This is what an old
fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tre(869,7)you
don’t get(921,6)dust; amputate(51,8)bon(51,10) (51,10)it(203,12). Come, come, you old Smut,(987,8)bear a hand(1000,6)let’s
have(483,6)ferule(866,6)uckle-screw; I’ll be ready(835,8)m presently.
Lucky now(432,12)(121,6)’s no knee-joint to make;(600,6)might puzzle
a little; but a mere (572,8)(472,10)easy as making hop-poles; only I
(710,7)like to put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but(65,6)had the
time, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ev(689,14)
scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs
I’ve seen in shop windows wouldn’t compare at all. They soak water,
they do; and of course get rheumatic(665,6)(528,6)o be doctored(820,12) with washe(173,6)lotions, just(371,6)live legs. There; before
I saw it off(1010,7)I must call his old Mogulship(811,6)see whether the
length wi(662,6)all right; too short, if anything, I guess. Ha! that’s
the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or(630,6)somebody else,(71,8)certain.

AHAB (_advancing_). (_During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues
sneezing at times._)

Well, manmaker!

Just in (677,6)sir. If(85,7)ptain pleases, I(300,6)now mark the (325,6).
Let me measur(73,7)

M(15,6)d for(740,6)! good. (136,6)it’s not the firs(171,6). About it!
(506,7)keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here,
(287,9); l(168,6)feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.

Oh, sir, it(562,7)reak bones—beware, (8,6)!

No fear; I(714,6)a good grip(20,9)to(134,6)something in this slippery
world that can hold, man. What’s Prometheus about there?—the
blacksmith, I mean—w(54,6)he(46,6)?

He(824,6)be forg(611,8)buckle-screw(248,7)now.

Right. It’s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a
fierce red flame(180,6)!

Ay(641,6); (62,6)t have the white heat for(294,6)kind of fine work.

Um-m. So(66,8). I do deem it now a most mean(849,6)ing(902,6)(361,6)old
Greek,(350,11), who made men, they say, should(170,6)been a(377,13)and animated them with fire; for (403,7)made in fir(402,6)

This(481,9)the remainder the Greek(215,6)the Africans of. C(820,8),
when he’s through(197,6)that(554,7), tell him to forge a pair of steel
(298,6)er-blades;(684,6)(584,6)edlar aboard(290,6)a crushing pack.

Sir?

Hold; while(766,12)i(769,8)it, I’ll order a complete man after a
desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his sock(182,6)n, chest
modelled(88,7)the Thames Tunnel(46,8)legs(505,6)roots to ’em, to stay
in one place(98,8)arms three(139,6)(379,8)the wrist; no heart at all,
brass forehead(638,7)bout a quarter of an acre(829,9)brains(602,6)let
me see—shall I(330,7)eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on
top of his head to illuminate inwards. There, tak(1003,6)order(825,7)way.

Now,(808,8)he speaking(497,6)(867,6)who(29,15)to, I(926,8)like
to know? S(216,7)keep standing here? (_aside_).

’Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; (727,7)one. No,
no, no; I(906,6)have a lantern.

Ho, ho! T(227,6)it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.

What art thou thrusting(932,6)thief-catcher into my face for, man?
Thrusted (449,6)is worse than presented pistols.

I thought, sir,(107,6)you spoke to carpenter.

C(12,8)? why that’s—but no;—a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely
gentlemanlike sort of business(255,6)art in (601,6)(133,9);—or would’st
thou rather work in clay?

Sir?—Clay? clay, sir?(414,8)mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.

The fellow’s impious! (421,14)sneez(712,9)?

Bone is(150,8)dust(125,6).

T(799,8)hint, then(944,6)when(246,10)dead, never bury thyself under
living people’s noses.(242,7)oh! ah!—I guess so;—yes—oh, dear!

Look y(341,12), I dare say(636,6)callest(122,9)a right good
work(444,8)(12,7), eh? Well(215,6),(737,6)it(1001,6) thoroughly well for
thy work, if,(259,6)I com(914,6)ount this leg(785,6)makest, I shall
nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that
is(268,13)my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Can(653,8)not drive(949,6)old Adam away?

Trul(652,6), I begin to(473,6)stand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard
something curious on(950,6)score, sir; how(971,6)a dismasted man(598,6)
entirely loses(225,6)eeling of his old spar, but it(464,6)be still
pricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so(905,6)

It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here(455,8)(440,7)here mine once
was; so, now,(48,7)s only one distinct(579,6)o the eye, yet two(20,7)
soul. Where(982,6)fee(767,6)ingling life; there, exactly(15,8)t(56,6)o
a hair, do I. Is’t a riddle?

I should(287,8)ca(801,6)a poser, sir.

Hist(836,6). How dost(916,6)kn(469,8)some (452,6), living, thinking thing
may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely(364,6)(725,8)w(34,6)est; aye, and(53,10)(258,6)in thy spite? I(14,6)most
solitary hours(222,6),(218,11)not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don’t
speak! And if I(648,6)(1014,6)the smart of my crushed leg, though(646,6)
now so long dissolved;(144,7)why mayst no(371,6), carpenter,(107,9)
fiery pains of hell for ever(281,6)without a body? Hah!

Good Lord! Truly, sir,(803,7)comes(676,6)at, I must calculate over
again; I(492,6) I didn’t carry a small figure(592,8)Look ye, pudding-heads(652,8)never grant premises.—How(292,6)before the
leg is done?

Perhaps an hou(701,9)Bungle away at it(491,7)and bring it to me (_turns to go_). Oh, Life!
Here I am, proud as Greek god(635,6)yet(692,10)debtor(993,6)is
blockhead for a bone to(740,6) on! Cursed be(847,6)mortal
inter-indebtedness which will not do(219,6)with ledgers. I would be free
as air; and I’m down(797,6)e whole world’s books. I am so rich, I could
have given bi(204,6)bi(604,6)(75,6)ealthiest Prætorians at the auction of
the Roman empire ((214,7)as(147,6)(141,6))(177,6)yet I owe for the flesh
(192,7)tongue I brag with. By heavens! I’ll get a crucible(787,6)into
it(800,6)(891,8) myself(290,6)to one(708,6), compendious vertebra. So.

CARPENTER (_resuming his work_).

Well, w(6,6)ell! Stubb knows him best of all(947,6)(33,6)always says
he’s queer; says nothing but(568,6)one sufficient litt(477,6)d(56,7)(68,11),(68,6)Stubb; (92,10)—(30,7)(105,7)and keeps dinn(817,6)

here’s his leg! Yes, now(773,6)I think of it, (45,11)bedfellow! has
a stick of whale’s jaw-bon(564,6)a wife! And this i(116,9); he’ll

places(602,6)(268,6)ree (22,6)(47,13)one hell—how(99,9)? Oh! I
don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of
strange-thoughted sometimes, they say;(552,9)’s only haphazard-like.
Then, a short,(575,8)old body like me, should never undertake to wade
out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains;(1018,6)ater chucks
you(93,6) the chin pretty quick(966,6)t(580,7)a great cry for
life-boats. And(574,8)the(127,6)’(627,7)long and slim, sure enough!
Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime(151,8)at must be
because(393,6)(9,7)m mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her
roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh(973,6)a hard driver. Look,

comes a-calling(618,6)his horn for all legs, true or false, as
brewery-men go round collecting(766,6)eer barrels, to fill ’em up again.
What a(342,6)his is! It looks(826,6)a real live leg, filed down to
nothing(933,7)e core; he’ll be standing on(97,6)to-morrow(37,10)

According to usag(841,7)were pumping the ship next morning;(590,6)o! no
inconsiderable oil came up(561,6)the water;(716,6)asks below(968,6)have
sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown(123,6)(211,9)went(489,6)into

*In Sperm-whalemen(741,6)any (214,13)quantity of oil on board, it
is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and

ivory leg braced again(409,7)screwed leg of his table(91,6)(875,6) long
pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand(598,6)wondrous old man, with
his back (864,7)gangway door, was wrinkling his brow(230,6)trac(22,7)

“Either do that, sir, or waste in one day mor(234,6)than we may make

“Captain Ahab,” said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious(886,6)it almost
seemed(831,10)every way seek(379,7)avo(160,7)slightest outward

Ahab seized a loaded musket from(666,6)ack (forming part of most
South-Sea-men’s(669,6) furniture)(354,6)pointing it towards(976,11)exclaimed: “There is one God(692,7)s Lord(502,6)the earth(446,6)one

It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was,(818,6)as respecting
(281,9)(772,6)thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him;
or mere prudential policy which, under(327,6)ircumstance, imper(656,6)

CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.

Upon searching,(410,7) found(990,6)the casks last struck in(774,7)hold(155,6)perfectly soun(830,6)(67,10)leak must be further off. So, it
being calm weather, they broke out deeper and(11,7), disturb(927,7)
slumbers o(751,6)huge ground-tier butts(317,6)from(642,6)black midnight
send(1008,6)ose gigantic moles(249,10)daylight above. So deep did they
go(421,6)so ancient(275,6)corrode(289,7)weedy the aspect(186,8)lowermost

cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copie(322,9)posted
placards, vainly warn(374,7) infatuated old worl(351,9)e flood.
Tierce after tierce, too, of water(562,6)brea(573,7)beef(583,6)shooks of
staves(605,6)iron bundl(176,6)hoops,(778,13) out, till at(706,6)the
piled deck(825,8)ard to get about(865,10)hollow hull echoed under
foot, as if you(898,6)treading over empty catacomb(183,7)reeled and
rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was(756,6)hip as a dinnerless student(466,6)all Aristotle in his head. Well was
it(1007,10)Typhoons did not visit them then.

Now, at this time it(146,7)at my poor pagan companion(768,6)fast
bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized(187,7) fever, which brought him nigh
to his endless end.

Be it said(819,7)in(169,6)vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
dignity and danger go hand in hand;(600,6)you get to be(849,8), the
higher you rise(591,6)ard(20,7)toil. So(888,6)poor(266,12)ho, as
harpooneer, must not only face all the rage(948,8)living whale, but—as
we have elsewhere seen—mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and
finally descend into the gloom(124,8)hol(958,8)itterly sweating all
day(751,6)at subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
clumsiest casks and see (140,6)ir stowage. To be short, amo(274,8)men,
(394,7)(346,7)(507,6)(191,8)ers, so called.

P(410,12)! whe(944,7)hip was about half disembowelled, you should
have stooped over(527,7)tchway(796,6)peered down upon him there; where,
stripped (763,7)woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling(174,6)
amid(1011,6)dampnes(332,7)lime, like a green spotted lizard(1015,6)e bottom
of a well. And(12,7), or an ice-house, it somehow prov(193,8)m, poor
pagan(229,8) strange to say, for(746,9)heat of his(603,9)s, he
caught a terrible chill which lapse(695,7)a fever; and at last, after
some days’ suffering, laid him in his hammock, clos(639,8) very sill
(907,7)door of death. How he wasted and(11,9)w(792,8)ose few
long-lingering days, ti(1007,6)(958,6)med but little lef(281,7)m but his
frame and(531,7)ing. But as all else(211,6)m thinne(958,7)his
cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless,(149,8)growing fuller
and(11,7); they became of a(491,9)softness of lustre(414,6)mildly but
deeply looked out at you(274,7)from(534,6)ickness, a wondrous testimony
to(760,6)immortal health(263,8)(558,6)could not die, or be weakened. And
like circles on the water,(626,6), as(240,6)grow fainter, expand; so his
eyes(462,8)rounding an(13,10)(910,7)the rings of Eternity. An awe
that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of
this waning savage(524,6)saw as(917,10)hings(777,8)face, as any
beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly
(436,9)and fearful in man(625,7) yet was put(978,6)words or books(417,6)the drawing near of Death(417,7) alike levels all,(18,7)impresses all
with a last revelation(68,8)only an author(645,6)the dead(582,6)
adequately tell. S(642,6)—let us say it again—no dying Chaldee or Greek
had higher(930,6)olier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you
saw creeping(534,6)the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay(503,7)
swaying hammock(553,6)the rolling sea(726,8)gently rocking him t(764,6)final rest(65,10)ocean’s invisible flood-tide lifted him(267,11)
(278,7)towards his destined heaven.

Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as f(264,11) himself,
what he(374,8) of his case w(54,6)cibly shown by a cu(388,6)favour he
asked. He called one(275,6)m in the grey morning watch,(835,6)the day was
just breaking(387,7)a(356,7)s hand, said that while in Nantucket he had
chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like(496,6)ich
war-wood(272,8)native isle; and upon inquiry,(119,7) learne(158,7)all
whalemen who died(174,13), were laid(294,6)ose same(152,6)(167,6),
(649,6)at(727,7)ncy of being so(63,6)had much pleas(593,6); for it was
not un(229,9)custom(494,8)own rac(872,6), after embalming a dead
warrior, stretch(695,7)out(836,7)(345,6)(826,6)so left(796,8)be floated
away to the starry archipelagoes(183,6)not only do they believe(266,9)
stars ar(406,6)s, but(536,6)far beyond all (886,8)horizons, their own
mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue(895,7)s(518,6)so form
the white(701,6)ers(916,8)milky way. He added,(702,6)he shuddered (212,7)(902,11)(480,6)bur(566,7)(769,6)mmock, according(329,8)usual
sea-(474,6), tossed(727,6)something vile(381,8)death-devouring sharks.
No: he desired a(816,6)(801,8)ose of(709,12)all(235,6)ore congenial

much lee-way adown(257,6)im ages.

Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft,(844,6)arpenter
was at once commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding, whatever it might
include. Ther(115,6)some heathenish,(290,9)oloured old lumber aboard,
which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal
grove(713,9)Lackaday islands(999,6)(56,8)se dark planks(279,6)offin
was recomme(270,8)be made. No sooner wa(53,7)(332,8) apprised(841,7)
order, than taking his rule, he forthwith(944,6)(661,8)indifferent
promptitude of his character, proceeded in(854,7)forecastle and took
(456,11)measu(672,7) great accuracy, regularly chalking(515,11)
person as he shifted the rule.

“Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejacula(64,8)Long Island
sailor.

Going to his vice-bench(703,15) for convenience sak(249,6)general

When the last nail was driven(176,9) lid duly planed(782,6)itted, he
lightly shoulder(479,7)(256,7)and went forward(692,6)it, inquiring
whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.

Overhearing(769,9)gnant but half-humorous cries(816,6)which(292,6)eople
on deck began to(257,6)(197,13)way,(725,9), to every one’s
consternation, commanded(179,6)the thing(290,7) be instantly brought to
him, nor(564,6)here any denying him; see(239,6)at, of all mortals, some
dying men ar(614,6)most tyrannical; and certainly, since(381,7)ill

attentive eye. He(848,6)c(759,6)for(89,7)rpoon, ha(780,6)wooden stock

biscuits(753,6)then ranged rou(890,7)sid(694,7)in: a flask of fresh

a pillow(466,11)now entreated(535,6) lifted into his final bed, that
he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without
moving a few minutes,(556,6)told one to go (132,7)bag and bring out his
(755,7)god, Yojo. Then cross(914,6)s arms o(722,6)breast(686,6)Yojo
between, he(677,12)(730,11)lid (hatch(36,11)it)(300,7)(643,6)

sign(525,9)re(870,10)(956,6)mmock.

But (794,6)is was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all
(60,6)hile, drew nigh(500,6)m where he lay(814,6)with soft sobbings, took
him by(860,6)and; (818,7)other, hold(528,8)tambourine.

“Poor rover!(295,6)ye never have done(441,7)ll(234,7)eary roving?(164,6)
go ye now? But if(578,6)urrents carry ye to those sweet Antilles(70,7)the beaches are only bea(689,7)water-lilies,(173,9)do one(541,7)
erran(708,6)me? Seek out one(409,9)’s now(411,6)mi(809,6)long: I think
he’s(322,6)ose far(170,9). If ye find him(948,7)(1015,7) him; for he
must be very sad(25,6)look! he’s lef(714,6)(402,10) behind;—I found
it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, (814,8), die; and I’ll(308,6)ye your
dying march.”

“I(474,6)heard,”(771,10)Starbuck, gazing dow(581,6)scuttle, “that(868,6)olent fevers, men, all ignorance,(576,6)talk(828,6)ancient tongues; and
that whe(685,6)mystery is probed, it turns out always (133,7) their
wholly forgotten childhood(619,7)(121,15)(919,10)really spoken
(81,8) hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor
Pip,(890,6)is strang(747,7)ness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers
of all our(29,10)homes. Where learned he that, but there?—Hark! he
speaks again: but more wildly now.”

“Form two and two! Let’s make a General(187,6)m! Ho,(1011,6)’s his
harpoon? Lay it across here.—(697,21)huzza! Oh for a game
cock now to sit upon his head and crow!(753,9) dies game!—mind ye
that;(34,21)take ye good heed of (47,19)
game! I say; game,(6,6)(106,6) but base little Pip, he died a coward;
(15,6)ll a’shiver;—ou(212,7)Pip! Hark ye; if ye find(76,6)tell all the
Antilles he’s a runaway;(106,9),(10,10)(126,9)! Te(64,6)m he
jumped from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my tambourine over(234,6)Pip,
and hail him(530,8), if he were once(606,6)dying(511,6) No, no! shame
upon all(295,7)s—shame(490,6)them! Let ’em go drown lik(357,7)that(205,25). Shame(105,7)!”

During(330,7)is,(568,10)lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip
was led away,(800,6)he sick man was replaced i(687,7)ammock.

But(721,6)hat he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
(61,6)is coffi(115,6)proved a(718,6)fit(222,11)suddenly rallied; soon
there seemed no n(771,9)e carpenter’s box:(232,8)reupon, when some
expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said(448,6) the
cause of his(175,7) convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he
had just recalled a(915,8)duty ashore, which h(84,6)leaving undone;
(232,9)for(415,6)changed his mind about(723,6): he could not die yet,
he averred. They asked him, the(321,6)ther to live or di(231,6)a matter
(272,7)own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a
word, it was(753,9)’s conceit(389,7)if a man(642,6)up(238,10)to
live, mer(743,6)ness(245,11)kill him: nothing but(906,8), or a gale,
or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer(659,6)at sort.

Now,(651,6) i(532,6) noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;(837,6)while a sick,(30,10)(266,7)y be six months(658,10)ing,
generally speaking,(74,7)(114,8)is almost half-well again in a day.
So, in(950,6)time my(953,10)gained strength; and at length after
sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a
vigorous appetite) he(904,7)ly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms
and legs, gave himself a(221,6)stretching, yawn(927,12)bit, (890,7)n

Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid(437,7)ll manner of

CHAPTER 111. The Pacific.

When gliding(741,6)e Bashee isles we emerged at last up(653,7)great
South Sea;(345,7)t not for other things, I(544,7)have greeted my dear

thousand leagues of blue.

There is, one know(767,6)what sweet(792,7)y about(560,6)sea,(822,7)gently
awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
fabled undulations(500,8)Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.

prairies and Potters’ Fields of all four continents, the waves should
rise and fall(916,6)ebb(18,6)low unceasingly; for here, mill(257,7)
mixed shad(141,7)shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all

like slumberers in their beds; the ever(332,11)ves but made so by
(50,6)restlessness.

To any meditative Magian rover,(634,8)ren(1001,9), once beheld, must
ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost(505,6)s of

But few though(418,6)Pan stirred Ahab’s brain, as standing like an iron
statue at(751,6)ccustomed place besid(790,6)mizen rigging, with one
nostril he unthinkingly snuffed(850,6)ugary musk from the Bashee(520,6)

length upon these almost final water(767,7)gliding toward(672,6)Japanese
cruising-ground,(237,6)ld man’s purpose intensified itself. His firm
lips met(507,6)the lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead’s veins(696,6)ed(574,6)overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran
throug(434,6)vaulted hull, “Stern all! the(372,13)spouts thick

CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.

Availing himself(504,8)mild, summer-cool weather(515,6)now reigned in
(443,6)latitude(433,7)in preparation for the peculiarly a(964,6)pursuits
shortly to be anticipated, Perth(471,6)begrimed, blistered old
b(216,9), had not removed his portable forge to(700,6)old ag(1024,6)ft(798,6)clud(277,6)s contributory work for Ahab’s leg, but still retained it
on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now(774,7)
incessantly invoked(54,8)headsmen(993,6)harpoone(814,9)bowsmen to do
some little job(396,8)m; altering, or repai(14,9)new shaping their
various weapons(105,7)at furniture. Often he would be surround(188,6)an
eager circle, all wait(988,6) be served; holding boat-spades,
pike-heads,(246,8)(624,7)lanc(636,8)jealously watch(460,8)every
sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man’s was a
patient hammer wiel(222,8) (28,8)arm. No murmur, no im(57,6)ce, no
petulance did come from him. Silent, slow(847,6)solemn; bowing over
(630,6)further(686,6)hronically broken back,(226,10) away, as if toil
were life itself(959,6)(613,7)vy beating of his(246,8)(32,17)
(32,8)eart. And so it was.—Most miserable!

A peculiar walk in(365,13), a certain slight but painful appearing
yawing in his gait(1023,6)at an early period of the voyage excited the
curiosity(36,8)mariners(200,6)to the importun(40,10)ir persisted
questionings he had finally given in;(460,7) it came to pass that(672,7)one now knew the shameful story(392,8)wretched fate.

Belated(1024,6)not innocently, one bitter winter’s midnight, on the road
running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt
the deadly numbness steal(699,8) him(728,8)ught refuge in a leaning,
dilapidated barn. The issue wa(138,7)loss(475,8)extremities of both
feet. Out(512,6)is revelation, part by part, at las(411,7)out the four

fifth ac(137,7)e grief(855,8)life’s drama.

He was an(785,10)who, a(148,6)age of n(736,6)sixty(759,6)postponedly

his happy hom(340,7)robbed them all of(231,6)thing. And darker yet to

of her(124,6)-armed old husband’s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled
by passing through(415,6)loors(985,6)alls, came up to her, not unsweetly,
in her nursery;(473,6)o, to(184,7)Labor’s iron lullaby(433,18)
infants were rocked to slumber.

Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
Had(36,8)taken(771,6)old(822,12)to thyself ere his full ruin came
upon him, then(526,15)widow had a delicious grief(988,6)her
orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of (715,6)ir after

Why te(69,7)whole? The blows(317,7) basement(836,7) every day grew

Hearken(402,10)se voices, East and West, by early sunrise(557,6)by
fall of ev(857,6) blacksmith’s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth
went a-whaling.


CHAPTER 113. The Forge.

With matted be(241,9)swathed(424,6)bristling shark-skin apron, about
mid-day,(128,6) was standing between his forge(892,6)nvil(728,6)latter
placed upon an iron-wood log(611,6) one hand holding a pike-head (443,6)
coal(895,8)ith the (755,6)at(132,10)’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came
along, carrying i(193,6)hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While
yet a little distance(1011,10)forge, moody(124,6)paused; till at last,
Perth(871,6)drawing his iron(77,11)ire, began hammering it(338,6)the
anvil—the red mass se(421,6)off the sparks(332,6)ick hov(72,6)flights,
some of(952,6) flew close to Ahab.

“Are(770,7)thy M(383,6)Carey’s chickens(557,7)? they are always flying
in thy wake; birds of good omen(949,7)but not to all;—look her(833,6)y
burn; but thou—thou liv’st among them without a scorch.”

“Because I am(24,7)ed all over,(565,13),” answered(900,6), resting
for a moment o(583,8)mmer; “I am past(121,7)ing; not easily can’st
thou(155,7) a scar.”

“Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful
to me. In no Paradise myself,(255,6)impatient of all misery in(861,6)s
that is not mad. Thou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dos(417,6)
no(43,8)? How(257,7) thou endure(429,9)being(42,6)Do the heavens
yet hate thee, tha(66,7)(78,7)(101,11)—What wer(100,7)making
there?(356,7)ding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”

“And(201,13)make it all smooth again(286,12), after such hard
usage as it had?”

“I think so, si(534,6)And I suppose(248,13)(108,6)e almost any(181,16); never
mind how hard the metal(447,12)?”

“Aye, sir, (138,8)I can;(219,6)(273,15)but one.”

“Look ye(939,10)n,” cried(848,6) passionately advancing, and leaning
with both hands on(893,6)’s(633,7)ers; “l(108,11)—_here_—can ye
(274,8)(1021,7)eam like this(398,13)” sweeping one hand across his
ribbed brow; “if(623,7)(765,7)(472,14)glad enough would I lay my
head upon thy anvil(242,6)feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.
Answer! C(825,11)(504,8)this seam?”

“Oh!(795,6)is the on(460,6)! Said I no(675,7)(456,22)(513,10)(694,12)i(80,12); aye, man(25,8)un(753,6)able; for
though(994,6)only see’st it here in my fles(94,6)has worked down into
the bone of my skull—_that_ is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s
play; no more gaff(974,6)pikes to-day. (697,12)!” jingling the
leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. “I, too, want a harpoon
made; one(416,6)a thousand yoke of fiends(609,6) not part,(766,6);
someth(150,6)at will stick in a whale(744,6)his own fin-bone. There’s the
stuff,” fling(229,7) pouch(677,8)e(677,6). (977,8)(747,14)these
are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.”

“Horse-shoe (58,6), sir? Why, Captain Ahab,(892,6)has(577,6), then, the
best and(67,6)ornest stuff we(1007,11)s ever work.”

“I know it, old man;(220,6)(140,7)(355,6)weld together(352,6)glue from the
melted bon(230,6)murderers. Quick! forge m(304,6)(527,7). And(26,9)
first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist(11,6)hammer
(187,6)(66,7)(177,14)the yarn(1008,6)strands of a tow-line(173,8)
I’ll blow the fire.”

When at last th(104,9)rods(779,6)made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
spiral(860,8)m,(941,6)(689,8)hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A
flaw!” reject(707,8)last one. “Work(870,6)over again(840,7).”

This done(860,7) was about to begin weld(797,8)(406,7)into(201,6)when
Ahab stayed his(189,7)and said he would(577,6)(915,8)iron. As(704,7)
with regular, gasping hems, he(475,7)ed (920,12)(182,8)passing to
him(909,6)lowing rods(380,6)after the other(573,7)(648,6)d presse(648,7)
shooting up its intense straight flam(891,6) Parsee passed silently, and
b(133,6)over(282,6)ead towards(598,9), seemed invoking some curse or
some ble(228,6)(256,7)toil. But, as(621,6)looked up, he slid aside.

“What’s(522,6)bunch of lucifers dodging(506,8)here for?” muttered
Stubb, lo(162,6)on(1015,9) forecastle. “That(275,8)smells fire(894,6)a
fusee;(893,6)(30,6)of it himself,(40,7) hot musket’s powder-pan.”

A(892,11)shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat(125,6)as
Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hi(601,6)into the cask of water near
by(520,6)sca(809,6)steam shot up(812,6)Ahab’s bent fac(403,6)ould’st thou brand m(905,8)?” wincing for a moment with the pain;
“have I been but forging my own(86,6)ing-iron(874,6)?”

“Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is(49,7)is
harpoon fo(854,6)White Whale?”

“F(24,7)white fiend! But now(53,9)barbs;(259,6)must make them
thy(531,6)man. Here are my razors—the best of steel; here(985,6)(72,8)
barbs sharp a(885,6)needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”

F(369,11)(995,6)old blacksmith eyed the(137,7)(87,6)ough he would
fain not us(207,6).

“T(220,8), man, I have no need(329,8)m; for I now neither shave, sup,
nor pray till—but here—to work!”

Fashioned a(813,7)into an arrowy shap(297,7)welded by(633,6) (745,6)
(858,7)the(348,6) soon point(253,7)end(317,8)iron(856,8)(373,6)(301,10)was about giving(503,10) their(923,11), prior to
(915,6)(47,7)m, he cried (845,7) to place(611,6)ater-cask near.

“No, no—no(939,7)(678,6)at; I want i(507,9)true death-(119,6). Ahoy,
there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me
as much blood as will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster
of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen
flesh(801,6)(947,15)’(134,6)(60,7)then (388,6)ed.

“Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed(22,11)diaboli!”
deliriously howled Ahab,(912,8)malignant iron scorchingly devour(879,6)
baptismal(330,6).

Now, must(556,9) spare poles from below(748,6)selecting one of
hickory, with(666,8)k still invest(401,6),(630,6)fit(767,12)(812,8)ocke(591,9)iron. A coil of new tow-line w(801,6)n unwound(152,7)ome
fathoms of it taken(909,7) windlass(198,7)tretch(781,6)a great tension.
Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,
then eagerly bending over it(330,8)eing no strandings(292,7)exclaimed,
“Good! and now(900,7)e seizings.”

At one extremity(160,10)was un(95,6)e(297,7)(62,6)parate spread yarns
were all braided and woven rou(59,8)(425,13)harpoon; th(561,6)
(414,9)driven hard up in(393,7)(490,6);(601,6)the lower(524,6)(344,7)(69,6)raced half-way alo(671,7)pole’s lengt(906,7)firmly secured so,
with intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron(982,6)rope—like the
Three Fates—remained in(322,6)ble(790,6)Ahab moodily stalked away with
the weap(298,8)sound of his ivory leg(416,11)(32,8)the (865,7)
(168,6)both hollowly ringing(285,7)every plank. But ere he entered his
cabin, light, unnatural,(361,6)bantering, yet most piteous(181,7)was
heard. Oh, Pip! thy w(849,8)laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy
strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy(646,7)
melancholy ship(995,6)mocked it!


CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.

Penetrating further(594,6)(12,7)(696,9)hear(760,9)Japanese cruising
ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,
pleasant weather,(1009,6)welve, fifteen, eigh(10,6)and twenty hours on
the stretch, they were engaged(132,8)boats, steadily pulling, or
sai(12,8) paddling after the whales, or for an(872,6)lude of sixty or
seventy minutes calmly awaiti(973,6)ir uprising; though(493,6)but small
success(266,6)heir pains.

At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
heaving swells; seat(294,6)his boat(814,7) as a birch canoe; and so
sociably mixing(686,10)soft waves themselves, that lik(597,7)h-stone
cats(432,6)purr against the gunwale; these are the(249,6) of dreamy
quietude, when behold(362,7) tranquil beauty and brillianc(844,9)ocean’s skin, one forge(154,6) tiger(779,7)that pants beneath it; and
would not will(971,6)remember(255,7)this velvet paw but conceals a
remorseless fang.

T(251,18)(232,7)(428,7)whale-boa(308,6)rover softly feels a
certain filial, confident, land-like feeling toward(250,6)sea;(441,6)he
regards it as so much flowery earth(541,6)the distant ship revealing
only(453,6)ops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high
rolling(614,6), bu(32,10)the tall grass of a (47,8)prairie: as when
the western emigrants’ horses only show(948,7)erected ears, while(974,6)
hidden bodies widely wade(151,13)amazing verdure(478,6) long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over(792,6)
there steal(688,6)hush,(10,7)m; you almost swear(708,7)lay-wearied
children lie sleeping in(890,7)solitudes, in some glad May-tim(890,7)
the(527,7)s(857,7) woods are plucked. And all(780,6)mixes with your most
mystic mood; so(884,6)fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,
and form one seamless whole.

Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
(31,9) an effect on Ahab. But if(323,8)ecret golden keys(126,6)eem
to op(978,8)m his own(51,15)treasuries, yet did his breath
upon them prove(787,6)arnishing.

Oh,(787,6)y glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes(515,7) soul; in
ye,—though long parched b(982,6)dead drought(515,8)earthy life,—in ye,
men yet may roll, like young(894,8)in new morning clover;(515,6)or some
few fl(513,6) moments, feel the cool dew(654,8)life immortal (305,7).
Would to God(754,7)blessed calms would last(470,6)(922,6)ngled,(9,6)ing
threads of(105,6)are woven by warp and woof:(88,7)cross(318,6)storms, a
storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progres(433,7)is
life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and a(220,6)last one
pause:—(53,8)infancy’s unconscious spell, boyhood’s (545,6)tless
faith, adolescence’ doubt ((418,6)mmon doom), then scepticism(17,6)
disbelief, resting at(164,6)in man(119,7)pondering repose of If. But
once gon(257,9), we trace the round again(611,6)are(239,6)ts, boy(289,6)
men(298,6)Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor
no more? In what rapt ether sail(69,6)world, of which(20,6)eariest will
never weary?(131,7)i(129,7)oundling’s father hidden? Our souls are like
those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of
our paternity(270,6)in their grave(614,6)we must there to learn it.

And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into that
same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—

“Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s
eye!—Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered shark(871,7)thy kidnapping
cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy(21,6)memory; I look deep
down and do believe.”(338,6)Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up(441,6)(392,7)
(330,7)light:—

“I am(86,8)a(97,8) has his history; but here(32,7)takes oaths(423,6)he has always been jolly!”


CHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor(568,7)jolly enough wer(987,6)sights(376,7)e sound(127,6) came(721,9)down
befo(56,7)wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had(188,6)welded.

It was a Nantucket ship, t(182,11),(984,7)had just wedged in her
last cask of oil(828,6)bolted(772,6)her bursting hatches; and now, in
glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-glori(33,6)
sailing round amo(1022,6) widely-separated ships on the ground, previous
to poin(173,6)er prow for home.

The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red
bu(93,6)at their hats; from(521,6)tern, a whale-boa(422,6)suspended,
bottom down(329,6)hanging captive(77,10)bowspri(66,7)ee(245,6)long
lower jaw of(22,6)ast(117,6) they had slain. Signals, ensigns(846,6)jacks
of all colours(721,6)flying(212,6)her rigging, on every side. Sideways
lash(596,6)each of her(360,7)basketed top(96,7)two barrels of sperm;
above(686,6),(671,7) top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender break(427,6)
the same precious fluid(690,7)ailed to(503,7)in truck(840,7)brazen
lamp.

As(863,6)fterwards learned(865,14) had met with the most
surprising success; all(33,7)re wonderful, for that while cru(57,6)in(207,10)seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without

officers’ state-rooms. Ev(865,7)cabin table itself(165,10)knocked
into kindling-woo(611,7)(64,10)mess dined of(932,6)broad head of an
oil-butt, (835,7)down to(340,6)loor for a centrepiece. In the

his(990,8)satisfaction.

As this glad ship of good luck bore(598,6)upo(781,6)moody Pequod, the
barbarian sound of enormous drums came(915,6)her (634,10)(757,6)drawing
still nearer, a crowd of her men(943,7)een standing round her huge
try-pots, which, cover(391,8)the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin
(504,6) black fish, gave forth a loud roar to(505,6) stroke(562,7)
clenched(423,7)(80,7)crew. O(329,6)quarter-deck(899,6)mates and
(667,12)were dancing(200,10)olive-hued girls who had elop(632,7)
them(376,6)the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,
firmly secured aloft betwee(532,6)foremas(875,6)mainmast, three Long
Island negroes,(791,6)glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were
presiding over(960,6)ilarious jig. Meanwhile, other(374,9)ship’s
company(582,6)tumultuously busy a(921,6)masonry(434,8)try-works, from
whic(585,6)huge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought
the(134,7)pulling(866,6)the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they
raised, as the now useless brick(391,6)ortar(820,6)being hurled into the
sea.

Lord(440,7)ster(351,6)all this scene(670,6)captain stood erect on(74,6)hip’s elevated(731,15)so th(351,7)whole rejoicing drama was
full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
diversion.

And Ahab, he too was stan(581,6)n his(169,16)haggy and(1018,6),
with a stubborn gloom; and(381,8)two ships crossed each(642,6)’s
wakes—one all jubilations for things passed(358,6)oth(384,7)forebodings
as to(47,8)to come—their two(411,8)s in themselves impersonated the
(382,6)striking(336,6)ast(809,9)cene.

“Come aboard, c(13,10)!” cri(77,6) gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting
a glass(303,6) bottle(163,7) air.

“Hast see(767,6)White Whale?” gritte(454,6) in reply.

“No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” sai(265,6)(358,6)good-humoredly. (248,12)!”

“Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”

“Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but(363,12), old
hearty(388,8)long. I’ll soon take(859,6)black from your brow. Come
along, will ye (merry’(701,6)play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”

“How wondrous familiar is a fool!” mutter(431,7); then aloud, (328,9)
(106,24) bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an
empty ship, and out(172,11) So go thy ways(35,6)I(254,6)mine. Forward
there! Set all sail(81,6)keep her(882,6)e wind!”

And thus, while(942,6)ne(311,6)went cheerily befor(34,6)breeze(988,11)
stubbornly fought against it; and s(121,6)two vessels parted; the crew
(947,7)Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the
receding(963,9)(832,6)the(981,12)men never he(47,6)their gaze for
the lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the
taffrail, eyed the(637,15) craft, he too(739,7)his pocket a
small vial of sand(536,6)then(280,9)from th(429,7)(473,7)vial, seeme(527,7)by bringing two remote associations together, for(894,6)vial was
filled(390,6)Nantucket soundings.


CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.

Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s favourites
sail close by us, we(862,6)gh all adroop(681,7), catch somewhat (605,6)
rushing(708,9)and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So(348,8)it(665,6)(689,10). For next day after encount(692,6)the gay(671,9),
whales(602,6)seen and four(19,7)lain(832,6)one(195,7)m by Ahab.

It was far dow(329,6)afternoo(57,7)when all(555,6)pearings(271,8)crimson fight(738,6)done:(137,6)loating(439,6)e lovely sunset sea(986,6)ky,
su(188,6)whale both stilly died(609,9); then, such a sweetness and
such plaintiveness(41,7)inwreathing orisons curled up(596,6)at rosy
air,(705,6)it almost(782,7) as if far(939,6)(831,9)deep green convent
valley(293,8) Manilla isles, the Spanish land-(588,8)wantonly turned
sailor, had gone to sea, freight(855,8)these vesper hymns.

Soothed again, but only s(24,7)to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned
off(235,10)whale, sat intently watching his final wanings(291,9)
now tranquil boat(748,6)that strange spectacle observable i(635,6)sperm(749,8)dying—the turning sunward(368,9)head(922,6)so expir(50,6)at
(110,17), beheld of(598,8)placid evening, somehow to Ahab
conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.

“H(164,6)s and(10,7)him to it,—how slowly(415,6)how steadfastly, his
homage-rendering and invoking brow,(517,6)his last(288,6) motions. He too
worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal(704,8)sun!—Oh
that(621,7)too-favouring eyes should see(36,21)sights.
Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in
(755,6)most candid(280,6)mpartial seas; where to traditions no rocks
furnish tablet(46,9)for long Chinese ag(949,8)billows have still
rolled on speechles(494,6)unspoken to, as stars(754,7)hine upon the
Niger’(575,10)source;(291,7)too, life dies(747,10)full of(452,6);
but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse(810,6)it
heads some other way.

“Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
thy separate throne some(421,6)in(955,8)rt(968,7)se unverdured(466,6)

sun,(768,6)only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet(113,10),
darker half, rock me(117,6)a prouder, if a (42,7)faith. All thy
unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of
once living things, exhaled as air(210,6)water now.

“Then hail, for ever(15,7)O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
fowl finds (439,6)ly rest. Born of earth, yet suckl(188,6)the sea; though
hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!”


CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.

The four(795,6)s slain(515,6)evening had died wide apart; one, far to
windward(22,7)less distant, to lee(31,9) ahea(11,8)stern. These
last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but(370,7)(127,6) one
could not be reached till morning;(991,8) boat(749,6)had killed it lay
by its side all(119,6)(59,8)at(60,6)was Ahab’s(329,7)waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead(933,6)’s spout-hole; and
the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon
the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which
gently chafe(306,6)(181,8)broad flank, like soft surf(85,6)a beach.

Ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep(464,9)Parsee; who
crouching i(171,6)bow, sat wat(25,6)the sharks,(696,6)spectrally played
rou(500,7)whale(262,6)tapp(216,7)light cedar planks with their tails. A
sound(240,6)the moan(154,7)squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven
ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shudd(453,6)through the air.

Started(520,6)his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw(328,13)and
hooped (265,6)by the gloom of th(856,7) they(406,8)(650,6)st men in a
flooded world. “I have dream(827,6)again,” said he.

“O(96,6)hearses? Have I not said, old man(445,7)neither(48,7) nor
coffin can be thine?”

“And who ar(95,8)(925,7)die (730,7)sea?”

“But I(113,21)ere thou coulds(62,11)is voyage, two

mortal hands;(648,6)he visible wood(402,8)last one(113,6)be grown in
America.”

“Aye, aye! a strange s(460,7)at,(845,7):—a(338,8)and its plumes
floating(697,6)the ocean(768,9) waves fo(29,6)pall-bearers. Ha! Such a

“Believe it or not,(374,7)an(290,7)die till it(344,8)(541,9)(235,6)nd what was(1002,7)aying about thyself?”

“Though it come to(718,9), I(163,7)still go before(449,6)thy pilot(114,11)en(545,6)art so gone(52,7)—if(581,7)ver befall—then ere I can

Well, then, did I b(339,7)all ye say, oh m(194,7)! (928,7)here two

Ahab,(731,6)a laugh of derision;—“I(75,8)(69,18)!”

Both were silent again, as(937,6)an. The grey dawn came on,(1002,8)
slumbering crew arose from the boat’s bottom(54,6)ere noo(298,6)dead
whale was brought(737,8)ship.


CHAPTER 118(145,6)Quadrant.

The season(981,9)Line at length drew near;(128,6)very day(779,6)Ahab,
coming(184,6)his cabin, cast(505,10)aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
ostentatiously handle his spokes(313,9) eager mariners quickly run to
the brac(50,8)would st(375,7)re(502,7)(595,6)ir(666,6)centrally fixed
(357,7)nailed doubloon; impatient(307,9)order to point(381,9)’s
prow(346,9)equator. In good time(65,11)came. It was hard upon
high noon(386,6)(695,6)seated(819,8)bows of his high-hoisted boat, was
about taking his wonted daily observation of(575,6)un to determine his
latitude.

Now,(947,6)at Japanese sea(484,6)days in summer are as freshets of
effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid(89,11)un seems(794,6)lazing
focus(178,8)glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass(920,6)sky looks
lacquered; clouds(550,7)are none; the horizon floats(783,6)this
nakedness of unrelieved radiance is a(184,6)insuffe(148,6)splendors of
God’s throne. Well(346,6)Ahab’s q(948,7) was furnished(712,6)coloured
glasses, through which to take sight(479,6)at solar fire. So, swinging
his(607,8)form to the roll(540,9)hip(859,7)ith his
astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remain(713,8)at
posture for some moments to catch the precise instant whe(941,6)sun
should gain its(45,9)meridian. Meantime while(782,6)hole attention
was absorbed(721,6)Parsee was kneeling beneath him o(130,7)hip’s deck,
(290,9)face thrown up like(474,7), was eyeing(888,6)am(893,6)(347,7)m;
only the lid(1000,9)eyes half hooded their orbs(411,6)his wild(125,6)was
subdu(389,6)an earthly passionlessness. At lengt(364,6)desired
observation was taken(774,6)(517,8) pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab
soon calculated what his latitude must be at(767,6)(490,15). Then
fall(608,6)to a(548,7)’s revery, he again looked up towar(986,6) sun and
murmur(662,8)mself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot(28,6)
tellest me truly where I _am_—but canst(73,6)cast(459,6)east hi(702,6)re
I _shall_ be? Or(54,12)tell(87,7)some other th(644,6)sides me is
this(820,7) living? Where is Moby Dick? This(831,9)thou(378,8)

behold(74,7); aye(662,6)(59,9)(54,20) equally (62,9)
the objects(867,8)unknown, thither side of thee,(433,6)sun!”

Then gazing (619,7)quadrant(805,7)andling, one after th(354,7), its
numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered(634,6)(899,6)muttered:
“Foolish toy! babies’ play(454,6)of haughty Admiral(966,7)Commodores,
and Captains; the world brags(257,10)of thy cunning(695,10); but

are the glances of(194,11); not shot from the crown of his head, as
if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament.(359,17)

As the frantic old man(56,6)spoke(977,7)us(141,8)(616,7)his(698,6)(86,6)ad feet, a sneering triumph(786,6)seeme(531,8)for Ahab(385,6)a
fatalistic despair(53,23)himself—(784,6)passed over the
mute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he ros(222,6)glided away;
while, awestruck(582,7) aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered
together(514,7) forecastle, till(256,7)troubledly pac(465,6)(743,7)
shouted out—“T(769,6)braces! Up helm!—square in!”

In an instant the yards swung round;(371,6)(503,6)ship half-wheeled upon
her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erect(639,6)s(67,7) her
long, ribbed hull,(518,8)(127,7)(90,6)Horatii pirouetting on one
sufficient steed.

Standing betwee(349,6)knight-heads, Starbuck watche(994,6)Pequod’s
tumultuous way(951,6)Ahab’s also, as he went lurching alo(411,11).

“I have sat before(959,7)nse coal fir(829,6)(134,8)it all aglow, full

thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”

“Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal(43,6)—mind ye that, Mr.

mutter, ‘Here some one thrusts these cards into(17,7)old hands of
mine; swears that I must play them(559,6)no others.’ And damn me,(980,6)
but thou actest right; live i(689,6)game(635,6)die in it!”

cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.

Towards evening of(630,6)day(149,6)Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
bare-pole(39,6)left to fight a(215,8) which had struck her directly
ahead. When darkness came on, sky(189,6)ea roar(204,8)plit with the

fluttering here and there(77,10)rags(209,7)the first fury(321,6)e
tempest had(273,6)for its after sport.

Hol(427,6)y a shroud, Starbuck was standing o(951,6)quarter-deck; at

to the very top(279,8)crane(876,7)windward(336,8) boat (Ahab’s) did
not escape. A great rolling sea, d(174,7)high up against(545,6)eeling

question. “T(490,8)that now hammers at us(310,7)ve us, we can turn it
into a fair wind(572,6)will drive(64,6)(634,6)home. Yonder, to windward,
all is blackn(170,7)doom;(1022,8)lee(629,6)homeward—I see it lightens up
(552,7)but not with the(36,6)ning.”

A(738,7)moment in (984,9)e intervals of profound darkness, following
the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost (859,7)same
instant a volley(133,6)under peals rolled overhead.

“Who’s(786,6)?”

“Old T(53,6)!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
pivot-hol(316,7)(571,8) find(67,8)path made plain(60,6)m by elbowed
lances of fire.

Now, a(705,6)(387,9) rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
the perilous fluid into(1015,6)oil; s(13,6)kindred rod which at sea some
ships(87,7)to each mast,(122,17)onduct it(104,10)water. But
as this(39,8)or must descen(65,8)siderable depth,(861,6)its end may
avoid all contac(687,11)hull(565,7)s moreover, if kept co(568,6)ly

ship’s(944,10)-rods are not always overboard(1002,6)are generally made

to vigilance by the vivid(859,11)that had just been darting
flambeaux, to(910,6) Ahab(968,6)s post. “Are they(357,10)? drop them
(648,6)fore(670,6)ft. Quick!”

“Avast(218,9)Ahab; “let’s have fair play (687,6)though we(400,7)
weaker side. Yet I’(799,7)ribute to rais(334,6) o(613,6)Himmalehs and

them be, sir.”

“Look alof(224,10)(442,8). “The corpusant(486,7)(16,11)”

A(138,7)yard-arms were tipped(1017,6)a pallid fire(1022,6)touched at each
tri-pointe(501,11)-rod-en(70,7)three tapering white flames, each of
the(41,9)ll masts was silently burning(968,6)at sulphurous air, like
(108,6)gigantic wax(121,6)s be(548,7) altar.

“Blast the boat! let it go(779,11)ubb at this instant, as a swashing
sea heav(938,6)under his own little craft, so(783,6)its gunwale vio(225,6)
jammed his hand, as he was passing a l(117,6). (190,7)it!”—but slipping
backward(652,8)deck, his uplifted eyes caugh(255,6)(397,6); and
immediately shifting his tone he(843,6)—(609,15)(846,6)mercy on us
all!”

To sailors, oaths are household words;(992,6)will swear(485,6)e trance(544,8)calm, and(31,9)eeth of(13,7)mpest(76,12)imprecate curses
from(89,6)opsail-(765,9), when mo(530,6)y teeter over to a seet(496,8)(938,6)in all my voyagings, seldom(272,6)I heard a common oath when
God’s(724,9)finger has been lai(448,9)ship;(158,6)His “Mene, Mene,
Tekel Upharsin”(65,10)woven into(68,7)rouds(962,6)(441,6)dage.

While(735,6)(1004,6)nes(889,6)(880,8)aloft, few(429,6) were(217,7)(336,8)
enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stoo(667,9)forecastle, all
their(670,6)gleam(1007,12)pale phosphorescence(1013,6) a far away
constellation of stars. Relieved again(1014,7)ghostly light, the
gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loom(996,6)to thrice his real stature, and
seeme(362,6)black clou(302,7)which(733,6)hunder had come. The parted
mou(731,6)Tashtego revealed his shark-whit(774,7),(89,7)strangely
gleamed as if(724,7)oo had(612,6)tipped by(967,11); while lit up by
the preternatural(302,8)Queequeg’s tattooing burned(406,6)Satanic blue
flames on his body.

The tableau all waned at last wit(296,6)(664,11)aloft; and once more
the Pequod and every soul on her deck(695,7)wrapped in a pall. A moment
or two passed,(882,6)Starbuck, going forward, push(591,11)some one.
It was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I(839,7)thy cry; i(61,6)not
the same(769,6)e song.”

“No, no,(44,7)n’t; I sai(986,9)(460,7) have mercy on us all(316,6)I
hope(532,6)will, still. But do(557,6)only(68,15)long faces?—have
they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr.(332,9)—but it’s too dark
to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw(116,7)sign
of good luck; for those masts are root(510,8)hold(90,6)is(478,7)to be

yet be as(27,7)spermaceti candles—that’s the(253,6)promis(287,8).”

At(321,7)oment(723,9) caught sight of(691,6)’s face slowly beginning
to glimmer(212,6)sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!”(947,9)
more the high tapering(468,6)(933,7)beheld(377,6)what seemed redoubled
supernaturalness(805,7)ir pallor.

“T(782,34),”(171,6)(942,6),(974,6).(306,7)e base of(447,7)inmast, full beneath the doubloon an(900,6)flame,
the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but(614,6)his head bowed away
from him; while near by, from the arched(354,6)verhanging rigging, wher(939,7)had just been engaged securing a spar, a number(253,8)seamen,
arrested by(625,6)lare, now cohered together, and hung pendulou(766,8)a
knot of(102,6)d wasps(208,6)a drooping, orchard twig. In various
enchanted attitude(857,8)the stand(65,7) step(78,8) ru(715,6)skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted (963,7)deck; but all
(624,6)eyes upcast.

“Aye, aye, men!(607,8)Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white
flame but light(988,6)way(135,8)White Whale! Hand me thos(678,10)
links there; I would fain feel this pulse(424,6)let mine beat(775,6)st
it; blood(18,8) fire! So.”

Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot
upon (811,10); an(1019,7)fixed upward ey(171,7)high-flu(738,6)ht arm,
he stood erect befor(527,6)lofty tri-pointed trinity of(938,6)s.

“Oh! thou clear spirit of(16,7)fire, whom (175,6)se seas I as Persian

[_Sudden, repeated flash(217,6)lightning; the nine flames leap
lengthwise(770,6)rice their previous height; Ahab, with the r(379,6)loses
his eyes, his right hand pressed hard upon them._]

“(927,21) (927,17)said I not so? Nor was it wrung
from me; nor do I now drop these links(827,6) canst blind(1017,6)I can

There burn th(777,8)!(946,9) magnanimous! now I do glory in my

I worship(967,6)”

“The boat! t(10,8)” cried Starbuck, “look a(661,7)oat, old man!”

Ahab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s(383,7)remained firmly lashed
in its conspicuous crotch, so(730,6)it projected(648,8)his whale-boat’s
bow;(617,6)he sea(789,6)had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather
sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there n(1021,8)a
levelled flame of pale, fork(255,6)e. As(494,6)ilent(325,8) burn(150,6)re
like a serpent’s tongue,(418,9) grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is
against(954,7)(449,7); forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill
continued; let me square the yards, while we may(552,9)(732,6)make a
fair wind of it homew(61,6)to go on a better(138,7) than this.”

Overhearing(678,11)the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
braces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all(350,6)ghast
mate’s (71,6)ts seem(590,6)irs; they raised a half mutin(733,6)y. But
dashing the rattling lightn(10,6)nks(183,7) deck(332,6)snatc(56,8)

transfix with i(833,6)first sailor(901,6)but cast(815,7)a rope’s end.
Petrified by his aspect(179,7)till more shrinking(847,10)fiery dart
(946,6)e held(472,6)men fell back in dismay(599,6)Ahab again spoke:—

“All your oaths to hun(212,6)White Whale are as binding as mine; and
heart, soul(704,6)body, lungs and lif(842,7)Ahab is bound. And(301,6)ye
may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out
the last fear!” And(424,6)one blast of his breath he extinguish(659,6)
flame.

As in the hurricane(476,6)sweeps(842,6)lain,(377,6)ly the neighborhood of

so much(869,7)re unsafe, because (33,17)a mark for

CHAPTER 120. The Deck Toward(310,6)End(96,8)First Night Watch.

_Ahab sta(622,6)b(344,6)helm. Starbuck approa(988,6)him._

“We must send dow(446,6)main-top-sail yard, sir(156,6)band is working
(943,7)nd the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”

“S(19,6)nothing; lash it. If I had sky(142,6)poles, I’d sway them up
now.”

“Sir!—in God’s name!—(103,8)Well.”

“The anchors are(204,8)(230,7)(169,8)get(95,6)inboard(171,19)(960,6)stir(18,10)but(193,6)everything(470,6)wind rises,

is a noisy malady. Oh,(74,6)medicine(15,15)!”


CHAPTER 121. Midnight.—The Forecastle Bulwarks.

_Stubb and Flask mounted on them(679,6)passing additional lashings over
t(791,11)there hanging._

“No, Stubb; you may pound(246,6)knot(53,7)as much as you please, but
you will never(64,7)into me what you(582,6)just now saying. And how
long ago is it since you sa(569,7)very contrary? Didn’(90,6)once say
that whatever ship Ahab (643,6)in,(460,6)ship should pay something extra
on its insurance policy,(190,6)as though it(795,6)loaded with powder
barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; d(212,10)say
so?”

“Well, suppose I did?(739,6)then? I’ve part changed my flesh(327,7)that
time, why not my mind? Besides(96,8)ing we _are_(216,36)(207,16); how the devil coul(1016,6)(249,9)get
afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty
red hair, bu(614,6)couldn’t get (103,6)now. Shake yourself; you’re
Aquarius, or the water-bearer,(888,6); might fill pitchers (726,6)r coat

I(622,9)companies(235,6)(48,6)guarantees? Here are hydrants(169,7).
But hark, again, and I’ll answer ye the other thing. First t(288,8)
leg off from the crown of the anchor here,(777,7), so I can pass the
rope; now listen. What’(243,6)mighty difference between holding a mast’s
lightning-rod(562,6)e storm(221,6)standing close by(59,7)(1002,6)hasn’t

thousand ships now sailing(417,6)eas.(962,6)you King-Post, you, I suppose
you would(748,7)very man(490,8)world go(276,6) with a small(539,15)running up(692,6)orn(397,6)his hat, like a militia
officer’s skewered feather(823,6)tr(209,7)behind(63,6)his sash. Why
d(1007,6)e be sensible(908,7)? it’s easy to(33,12); why (59,8),
(487,6)an(248,6)with half an eye can(95,12).”

“I(63,7)know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”

“Yes, when a fellow’s soaked thr(980,6)it’s hard(192,15)(774,6)’s
a fact. And I am(420,7)drenched(429,6)this spray. Never mind; catch the
turn there(978,6)pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors
now as if they were never going(389,7)used again. Ty(687,7)se two
(74,7) (139,6)Flask, seems(571,6)tying a man’s hands(540,8)him. And
what big generou(40,8)they are,(525,8)ure. T(194,6)(1023,6)r iron
fists, hey? What a hold(214,6)have, too! I wonder(170,9)wheth(975,6)

ca(497,7)ough. T(422,6)hammer that knot down(821,6)we’ve done. So; next
to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say,
just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank y(351,6)y laugh at
long-togs so(933,7); but(483,7)to me, a long tailed coat ought always
(972,6)worn in all storms afloat. The tails taper(686,11)at way,
serve to carry off the water, d’ye see. Same(837,6)cocked hats; the
cocks form gable-end eave-troughs(704,7). No more monkey-(309,6)s and
tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail(925,6)drive(895,6)a
beaver; so. Halloa! whew!(975,6) goes my (105,9) overboard; Lord,
Lord,(586,6)the wi(813,6)at come from heaven should be so unmannerly!
This is a nasty night, lad.”


CHAPTER 122. Midnight Aloft.—Thunder and Lightning.

_The main-top-sail yard_.—_Tashtego passing new lashings around it_.

“Um, um, um. Stop(234,8)under! Plenty too much(25,8) up here. What’s
the use of(60,8)? (91,12)We don’t wan(95,9); we(17,6)rum;
give us a glass of rum.(72,11)!(302,14)3(716,6)Musket.

During(935,10)violent shocks(156,6)e Typhoon,(975,6)an (474,7)Pequod’s
jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by
its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had(94,6)attached
to it—for they were slack—because some play(130,8)(184,7)was
indispensable.

In a(205,6)e gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock
(235,7)blast, it is by no means uncommon to se(85,6)needles in the
compasses, at intervals, go (674,6)and(10,6). It was thus with the
(433,8); at almost every(497,6) the helmsman had not fai(428,7)notice
the whirling velocity(101,6)which(375,6)revolved upon the cards;(252,7)a
sight(829,6)hardly anyone can behold without(433,6)sort of unwonted
e(547,6).

Some hours after midnight(692,6)(705,7) abated s(923,6),(954,8)roug(289,6)strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forwar(383,6)the
other aft—(539,7)vered remnant(855,9)jib and fore and main-top-sails
were cut adrift from(621,6)pars, and went eddying aw(722,6)leeward, lik(431,6)feathers of an albatros(707,6)ch some(937,6)are cast(924,8)winds
when(427,6)storm-(737,7)bird is (481,7)wing.

The three corresponding new sails(915,6)now bent(694,6)eefed(212,6)a
(101,7)rysail was set fur(345,8); so(446,8)(893,7)soon(271,6)(465,7)(680,6)ater(769,6)(1013,6)recision again;(436,8) course—for the present,
East-south-east—(738,6)he(862,6)o steer, if practicable, was once more
given(338,8)(865,8). For during the violence(544,8)gale, he had only
steered according to its vicissitudes. But as(165,8)now bring(104,7)
ship as near her(252,7) as possi(193,7)tch(154,8)compass meanwhile,
lo! a good sign!(557,9) seemed coming round astern; aye(914,6)foul
breeze became fair!

Instantly the yard(560,7)squared,(666,8)lively song of “_Ho(134,6)fair
wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!_”(499,6)rew s(281,7)for joy,(742,7)o
promising an event should so(621,6)have falsifie(582,6)evil portents
preceding it.

In compliance(660,6)the sta(800,6)order of his commander—to report
immediately(810,7)t any on(564,9)twenty-four hours, any decided
change i(944,6)affairs(624,8)deck,—Starbuck had n(235,6)er trimm(230,6)
(405,6)(719,7)(453,6)—however reluc(449,7)and gloomily,—than he
mechanically(945,6)below to apprise Captain Ahab(782,8)circumstance.

Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
moment. The cabin lamp—taking long swings this wa(211,6)that—was burning
fitful(405,8)casting (22,6) shadows upo(374,6)old man’s bolted door,—a

the door.

“O(693,7)level, Ahab’s hammock swings within; his head(923,6)way. A

“Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!”

Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the(375,8)’s
tormented sleep, as if(362,12)voice had caus(674,9)ng dumb dream
to speak.

The yet(661,6)l(711,9) shook like a drunkard’s arm(733,8) the panel;

CHAPTER 124. The Needle.

Next mo(248,6)the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in(434,6)slow billows of
mighty bul(264,7)striving in the Pequod’s gurgling t(309,6)pushed her on
like giants’ palms outspread(184,6)strong, unstaggering breeze ab(998,6)
so,(703,6)sky and air(512,8)vast outbellying sails(899,6)whole world
boomed befo(792,7)wind. Muff(267,7)the full(319,9)light, the
invisible sun was only known by(873,6)pread intensity of his(572,6);
where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned
Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything(364,7)ea was as a
crucible of molten gold(361,7)bubblingly leaps(861,6)light and heat.

Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and(159,6) time
the tet(510,6)ship lower(129,6)pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to
ey(472,6)bright sun’s(355,6)produced ahead(126,6)when she profoundly
settled(464,9)tern(101,12)behind(786,7)aw(501,6)(103,6)earward
place(1014,6)ho(34,7)ame yellow(498,6)were blending(346,6)his undeviating
wake.

“Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for(652,6)ea-chariot
of(170,8). Ho, ho! all ye nations(791,8)my prow, I bring(226,8) to
ye! Yoke o(810,8)rther billows; hallo! a tandem, I driv(877,6)sea!”

But suddenly reined back by some counter though(483,6)hurried towards
the helm, huskily dema(334,6)(373,9)hip was heading.

“East-sou-east, sir,” said(1018,6)rightened steersman.

“Thou liest!” smiting him(441,10)clenched fist. “H(115,6) East at this
hour i(315,6)morning(585,6)(355,8)astern?”

Upon this(803,7)soul was confounded;(489,9)phenomenon just then
observ(714,6)Ahab had unaccountably escape(902,8)one else; but its very
bli(677,6)palpableness must have bee(525,6)cause.

Thrus(290,7)(380,6) half way into(929,6)innacle,(156,6)caught one glimpse(690,8)compasses;(801,6)plifted arm slowly fell(269,6)a moment he almost
seemed to stagger. St(553,7)(972,6) him Starbuck looke(992,7)lo! the two

old man(638,6)a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I(417,6)it! It has happened
(1004,6). M(271,6)rbuck, last night’s thunder turned our(396,10)—that’s
all. Thou hast (86,6) now heard of such a thing, I take it.”

“Ay(621,7)never(63,8)has it(172,9) to me(939,17)pale mate,
gloomily.

Here, it(672,6)needs be said, that accidents like(867,6)(295,6)n more than
one case occurr(577,7)hips in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
developed(1013,9)ariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one
with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much
marvelled at(261,7)such(403,6)s should be. Instances wh(678,8)lightning
has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some (970,7)spars
and rigging,(216,6)ffect upo(292,6)(282,6) has at times been still more
fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so(512,6)the(680,7)
(435,9)steel was of no(520,6)us(524,6) an old wife’s knitting(450,7).
But in either case(216,6)(200,7)(731,6)again, of itself, recovers(977,6)riginal(192,8)thus marred or lost; and i(331,6)binnacle(914,10) be

even w(513,9)owermost one inserted into the kelson.

Deliberately standing(981,8)(182,12), and eyeing the transpointed
(211,9)(543,6)old man, (777,9)sharp of his extended hand, now took

thrust her undaunted bows(392,10)opposing wind,(148,10)upposed fair
one had only(854,6)juggling her.

Meanwhile, whatever(164,7)is own secret thoughts, Starbuck said
nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite(319,7); while Stubb and
Flask—who in some small degree seemed then(357,6) sh(482,6)his
feelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. A(444,10)men,(214,7) some
(558,6)m lowly rumbl(859,7)ir fear of Ahab was greater than(36,11)
of Fate. But as ever(788,7)(935,6)pagan harpooneers remained almost
wholly unimpressed; or if (17,9), it was(472,6)with a certain
magnetism shot(953,9)ir congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.

For a spac(971,6)(918,7) walk(395,6) deck in rolling reveries. But
chancing to slip(975,6)his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
sight-tubes(968,8)quadrant h(724,6)the day(350,7) dashed (798,7)deck.

“Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked
thee, and to-day(175,6)ompasses would fain have(55,8) me. So, so(274,6)Ahab is lord ove(943,6)level loadstone yet. Mr.(871,9)—a lance without
a pole; a top-maul(157,7)h(823,7)est(307,8)sail-maker’s needles.
Quick!”

Accessory, perhaps,(320,8)impulse dictating the thing he was now about
to do, were(646,8) prudential motives, whose object might(307,6)been to
reviv(625,6)spirits of his crew by a stroke(24,8)subtile skill, in a
matter so wondrous as tha(279,9)inverted(454,10). Besides(933,6)old

practicable,(309,7)t a(328,7)to be passe(530,7)by superstitious
sailors,(510,8) some shudderings and evil portents.

“Men,” said he, steadily turning upon(886,7)ew,(287,6)e mate handed him

that will point as true as any.”

Ab(1020,6)glances of servile wonder(667,6)exchanged b(965,6)(350,9)as
this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic
(723,6)follow. But(966,9) looked away.

With a blow from(861,6)(975,7)(271,6)knocked of(971,7)teel head(989,7)
lance(1020,9)n hand(599,7)(462,9)the long iron rod remaining, bade

maul, after repeatedly smit(56,8)upper en(189,7)is(145,9), he

indispensable(397,10)gnetizing(447,7)(763,6), or merely intended to
augment the awe(52,8)(943,6)is uncertain—he called for linen thread;
and mov(533,11)binnacle, slipped ou(102,6)two revers(381,9)s there,

and vibrating at eith(605,6); but at last it settled to its place, when
Ahab, who had been(385,6)tly wat(755,6)for(686,6)result, stepped frankly
back(962,10)(350,10)and pointing his stretched arm towards it,
exclaimed,—“Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lor(842,7)e level
loadstone! The sun is Eas(810,7)that(382,8) swears it!”

One(956,7)another they peered in(141,6)nothing b(559,6)ir own eyes could
persuade such ignorance as(48,6)s(946,6)o(110,22)slunk

In his fiery(99,6)of scorn(203,6)riumph, you then saw(287,6)in all his
fatal pride.


CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.

While now the fated Pequod(544,10)so long afloat(537,6)voyage(704,6)lo(670,6)line(598,6)ut very seldom(614,8) use. Ow(920,7)a confident reliance

course st(672,6)by(141,6)hip, as well(628,7) presumed average rate of
progression every hour. It(493,10)thus with the(523,7)(570,6)wooden
reel and angular log attached hung,(559,6)untouched, just benea(88,6)
railing(972,8)(904,6)bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and
win(679,6)war(28,8)all the elements had combined to rot a (982,6)that
hung so idly. But heedless of(80,7)is, his mood seized Ahab, as he
happe(97,7)glance(462,10)reel, not(659,6)hours(242,7)the magnet

“Forward, there! Heave(117,6)og!”

Two seamen cam(121,7)golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
“Tak(84,6)(334,6)one of ye, I’ll(946,6).”

They went toward(786,6)extreme stern, (871,7)ship’s lee side, wher(878,6)deck,(775,10)oblique energy(694,8)wind,(399,7)w almost dipping into

The(231,8) took(563,11)and holding it high up,(1020,8)projecting
handle-ends(851,8)spindle, round whic(979,6)spool of line revolved, so
stood(1021,10)(993,12)hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to
him.

Ahab (79,6)before him(734,6)was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, whe(892,6)old
(581,7), who was intently eyeing both him(639,9)line, made bold to
speak.

“Sir, I mistrust it; this(335,6)looks far gone, long heat(251,6)et have
spoiled it.”

“’Twill hold, old gentleman. L(66,16), h(864,7)y (72,8)thee?
Thou seem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life hol(798,6)e; not thou(145,8)I hol(907,6)spool, sir. But just as my captain says. W(813,7)se grey
hairs of mine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’specially(886,6)a
superior, who’ll ne’er confess.”

“What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s
granite-founded College; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where wert
thou born?”

“I(633,6)little rocky Isle of Man(330,6)”

“Excellent! Thou’st hit the world(999,6)a(401,8)know not, sir, but I was born there(443,6)(761,6)(115,13)hey? Well,(789,6)ther way, it’s good. Here’s a man
from Man;(16,6)(101,6)in once independent(211,6)and now unmanned(236,7);
which is sucked in—by what? Up(490,6)the reel! The dead, blind wall
butts all inquiri(849,6)ds at last.(74,9)it! So.”

The log was heaved. (20,6)ose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
dragging(988,6)aster(238,7)then, instantly(344,6)reel began to whirl. In
turn, jerkingly raised and lowere(492,7)e rolling billows(431,6)towing

“Peace,(691,6)crazy loon,” cried the(786,8), seizing him by the arm.
“Away(440,10)quarter-deck!(755,7) greater idiot ever scold(951,7)esser,” muttered Ahab, advancing.
“Hands off(546,8)at holiness! Where sayest(897,6)Pip was, boy?

“Oh, boy, nor(38,6)I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse

the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets(493,6)watch—then
head(545,6)Flask—was start(377,7)a cry so plaintively wild and
unearthly—like half-articula(502,6)ilings(890,7) ghosts of all Herod’s
murdered Innocents—that one and all, they(154,6)ed from their reveries,
and for(486,6)pace of(465,6)moments stood, or sat, or leaned(554,6)ransfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while(409,6)wild
cry remained within hearing(1007,6)Christian or civilized part(539,8)crew said it was mermaid(810,7)shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers
(132,9)unappalled. Ye(47,6)grey Manxman—the oldest mariner of
all—declared(632,6)the(504,6)thrill(1024,6)und(663,7)were heard,(12,6)the
voices of newly drowned men(738,8)sea.

Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear(829,6)is till(199,6)(767,7)hen he
came(896,8)deck;(323,8)then recounted to him(758,9), not
unaccompani(445,7) hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughe(950,7)thus
expl(512,6)the wonder.

Those(908,10)a(314,6)e ship had passed(317,9) reso(533,6)great
numbers of seal(526,8)ome young(22,6)(652,6)had lost(804,7)dams, or
some dam(39,22)cubs, must have risen nigh(170,10)and
kept (298,6)y(296,7)er, crying(150,7)bbing(325,6)(936,6)human (211,7)
wail. But(464,6)only the more affecte(221,7)(790,6)m, because most
(684,7)s cherish a very superstitious feeling about(311,9)rising not
only from(298,7)peculiar tones(600,6)in distress, but also(53,9)
(217,6)look(961,7)ir round heads(948,6)emi-intelligent faces, seen
peeringly up(155,7)(146,8) water alongside. I(823,9), under certain
circumstan(91,7)als(456,6)more than once been mistaken for men.

confirmatio(997,9)fate of on(463,8)ir (720,6)(688,6)morning. At
sun-rise(1002,6)man went(421,6)his hammock(964,6)s mast-head a(191,6)fore;
and whether it wa(794,8)e was not yet half waked(97,10)sleep (for
sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state),(117,18)us
(775,8) man, there is now no telling; but, be(963,6)as it may, he had
not(444,6)long at his perch,(681,6)a cry was heard—(16,6)and a
rushing—and looking up, they saw a falling phantom(445,8)air; and
(55,8)down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles(513,8)blu(969,8)
sea.

The life-buoy—a(212,6)sle(723,6)ask—was dropp(412,8)the stern, w(323,6)t
always hung obedient to a cunning spr(349,8) no hand rose to seize it,
and(856,6)un having(358,6)beat upon(654,6)cask it had shrunken, so(710,6)it

yield hi(827,6)pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.

And thus(958,6)irst man(956,7) Pequo(217,7)mount(140,7)mast to look out
for the White Whale, o(599,6)(20,11)’s own peculiar ground;(97,7)an

least as a portent; (231,7)y regarded it, no(40,7)foreshadowing of
evil(862,8)future,(387,6)(368,7)ulfilment of an evil already presaged.
They declare(615,7)now(978,6)knew the reaso(442,7)ose wild shrieks they
had hear(769,6)night before(347,6)aga(966,7)old Manxman said nay(971,8)ost(976,10) was(140,6)o be replaced; Starbuck was directed(906,6)e

therefore(668,12)going to leave the ship’s stern unprovid(117,8)a
buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a
hint concerning his coffin.

“A(504,11)of a(27,7)!” cried(500,9), starting.

“Rather queer, that, I should say,”(611,6)Stubb.

“It will make a good enough one(47,8)Flask, “the carpenter here can
ar(248,6)it easily.”

“Bring it up; there’s nothing else for it(148,10)(210,8)after a

CHAPTER 128. The Pequod Meets The Rachel.

Next day, a large ship(412,6)(37,6), was descried, bearing directly down
upo(510,6)(107,6), all her spars thickly clustering(412,6)men. At(523,6)ime
(67,10) was making good speed through the water;(707,6)s the
broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her(644,6)boastful sails all
fell together as blank bladders(596,7)re burst, and all life fled from
the smitten hull.

“Bad news; she brings b(21,7),” muttered the old Manxman(889,6)ere her
commander, who(746,8)rumpe(802,6)outh, stood up in his boat;(69,7)
could hopefully hail, Ahab’s voice was heard.

“Hast see(999,6)White Whale?”

“Aye, yesterday. Have ye(49,6)a whale-boat adrift?”

Throttling his joy(128,6) negatively answ(272,7)is unexpected question;
and would then have fain board(331,7)(517,8),(977,6)(19,12)
captain himself, having stopped his vessel’s way(788,6)seen descending
her side. A few keen pulls(545,6)(385,8)-hook soon clinch(493,6)
(934,6)’s main-chain(58,8)e sprang (999,6) deck. Immediately he was
recognised by(332,6)for a Nantucketer he knew(594,6)no formal salutation
was exchanged.

“Wher(527,8)?—not killed!(12,12)” cried Ahab, closely advancing.
“How was it?”

It seemed(848,6)somewhat late o(615,6)afternoon of(251,6)ay previous,
while three(33,8)(1006,8)’(751,6)s were engaged(809,6)a shoal of
whales, which had l(892,6)m some four or five miles from(595,6)hip; and(135,9)ey(110,6)yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump(484,7)ad
of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out(268,8)water, not very far to
leeward; whereupon(114,6)fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been
instantly lo(895,6)in(201,6). After a(736,6)sail before(214,6)ind, this
(111,7)boat—the(270,6)est keeled of all—(515,8)o(953,6)succeeded in
fastening—at least, as well as the man at(11,7)st-head could tell
anything about it. I(1023,6)distance he saw(20,7)minished dott(295,7);
and then a(469,7)gleam of bubbling(464,7)water; and(699,6)(731,6)nothing
more; whence it was conclud(774,8)(707,7)icken whale must have
indefinitely run away(724,6)his pursuers, as often happens. T(962,8)
some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals
were plac(539,6)the rigging; darkness came on(271,6)forc(488,6)pick up her
(955,6)(697,6)(801,9)(953,6)—ere going in ques(761,9)(714,7)one(125,7)
precisely opposite direction(638,6)hip had not only been necessitated(828,6)ave(437,6)boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to
increase her(616,10)from it. Bu(689,6)r(211,7)her crew being at last
safe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail on (12,8)—(632,8)e
missing(708,6) kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beac(435,8)every
other(872,6)loft o(831,6)look-ou(207,9)ough when she had thus sailed a
sufficient(890,10)to ga(575,7)presumed(598,6)(490,8)absent ones when
last seen;(116,8)she(924,6)paus(610,6)lower her spare(592,6) to pull all
around h(941,8)not finding anything, had again dashed(717,6)gain
(109,6), and(111,6)ed her(699,6)(754,6)(160,11)(271,9)continued doing
till daylight; yet no(542,6)least glimps(272,9)(467,8)keel had been
seen.

The story told, the stranger Captain immediately w(348,6) to reveal his
object in boarding the Pequod. He desired(808,6)ship to unite with(70,6)wn(925,7) search; by sailing ov(676,6) sea som(980,6) or five miles
apart, on parallel lines(374,6)so sweep(723,6)double horizon, as it were.

“I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “(225,6)ome one
in(242,6)(856,12) wore off(269,6)(358,7)’s best coat; mayhap, his
watch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two
pious whale-ships cruising (1020,6)on(553,10)(39,6)boat(398,8)height
(865,7)whaling season? See,(255,8)only see how pale (1016,7)s—pale in
the very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’(725,6)coat—it must have(705,6)the—”

“My boy, my own boy is amo(644,6)m. For God’s sake—I beg, I
conjure”—here exclaimed(772,22)to Ahab, who(920,6)far had
but icily received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me
charter your ship—(638,7)gladly pay for it(712,6)roun(24,14)—if
there be no other way—f(125,25)only—only that—you
must, oh, you (14,6)and you _shall_ do this thing.”

“His son!” cri(788,8), “oh, it’s h(33,6) he’s lost! I take back the
coat and (750,6)what says Ahab? We(512,6)save(850,6)boy(125,6)e’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” sai(483,6)old Manx
sailor standing behind them; “I(842,6); all of ye(859,7)their spirits.”

Now, as it shortly turned out, what made(319,6)incident (854,7)Rachel’s
the more melancholy, was(781,6)ircumstance,(265,6)not(887,6)was one(81,7)
(698,7)’s son(786,11) number(120,8)(1014,8)boat’s crew; but(835,6)
(49,18)(603,6)(47,11)s, a(939,6)same time, but on the
(652,6)hand, separated from(875,6)hip duri(159,7)dark vicissitudes(209,8)chase, (743,6)had been still an(754,6)son; as(547,6)for a(144,7)the
wretched fa(799,7)s plunged to the bottom(404,8)cruellest perplexity;
which(366,7)ly solved for him by his chief mate’s instinctively
adopt(238,8)ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,
that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to
pick up(521,6)ajority first. Bu(469,6)c(584,6), for some unknown
constitutional reason, had refrain(488,8)mentioning all this, and not
till forc(391,6)it by Ahab’s iciness did he allude to hi(749,6)yet
(707,10)y; a little lad(647,6)twelve years old, whose(518,9)ith the
earnest but unmisgiving hardihood(410,6)Nantucketer’s paternal love, had
thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a
vocation almost immemorially(803,6)estiny of all his race. Nor does it
unfrequently occur,(791,6)(193,9)(475,8)s will send a son of such
tender age away(949,9)m(526,6)a protracted three or four(366,6)’ voyage
in(570,6)(933,7)hip than their own; so(949,6)(19,6)first knowledg(788,6)
whaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance displa(300,6)
(1017,6)’s natural(492,7)timely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and
concern.

Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor bo(360,6)Ahab;
and Ahab(49,7)stood like an anvil, rece(658,6)every shock(739,6)without
the least quivering of(813,6)wn.

“I(492,6)not go,” said(183,13), “till you say _aye_ to me. Do(10,6)
as you would have me do to you(737,8)like case. For _you_ too(50,6)a
boy, C(645,6) Ahab—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a
child of your old age too—Yes, yes, you relent; I see it—run, run, men,
now(111,6)stand by to square(948,8)yards.”

“Avast,” crie(445,6)—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that
prolongingly moulded(475,7)word—“(282,8)Gardiner, (446,11)do it.
Even now I lose time. Good-bye, g(10,7). God bless ye, man(346,6)may I

(826,8)s:(305,6)brace forward agai(180,7)le(125,6)ship sail as before.”

Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
leaving(977,12) c(681,7)transfixed(261,6)is unconditional and utter
rejecti(1002,6)his so earnest suit. But starting(296,6)his enchantment,
(511,8) silently h(225,6) to(955,6)ide; more fell than stepp(218,11)
boat(845,6)return(64,6)his ship.

Soo(951,6)two ships diverged their wakes;(387,6)ong as(289,13)vessel
was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and t(12,8)t(762,7)dark spot,
however small, (157,7)sea. This way(68,7)at her(924,6) were swung
round; starboard(573,6)(13,7)(156,6)continu(333,7)ack; now she beat
against a head sea(256,6)again it pushed her(642,7) it; while all the
while, her masts and(174,12)thickly clustered(688,6)men,(356,6)ree

But by her still halting course and wind(818,6)oeful way, you plainly

CHAPTER 129. The Cabin.

(_Ahab mo(968,6)o go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow._)

“Lad, lad, I t(862,6)ee thou must not(48,7) Ahab now(137,6)hour is

screwed chair; another screw to it(66,7)must be.”

“No, no, no! ye(359,6)not a whole body, sir; do ye but use(360,6)me for
your one lost leg; only tread upon me(70,7)I ask no more, so I(794,7)

applies to him too; he grows so sane again.”

“They(807,6)(249,7),(679,6)Stubb did once desert(692,7)ittle Pip, whose
drowned bones now show white, for a(904,6)(205,6)ness of his living skin.
But I will never(119,8)y(155,8)as(153,11)him. Sir, I(986,6)go with

I(287,6)thee no; it canno(666,9)Oh good master,(8,8)(16,7)!

“Weep so, and(225,8)murder thee!(718,6)a car(304,7)Ahab too is mad.
Listen(66,6)(895,6)ilt often hear my ivory foot(715,6)the deck(120,6)still

thou(1000,7)as the circumference(962,6)s centre. So: God for ever bless
thee; and if it come to that,—(49,13)save thee, let what will
befall.”

(_Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward._)

“Here he(919,6)instant stood; I stand(510,6)s air,—but I’m alone. Now
were even(787,6)Pip here I could endure it, but he’s missing. Pip! Pip!
Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip? He(732,6)be u(100,6); let’s try the

CHAPTER 130. The Hat.

And now tha(839,6)he proper time and place, after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have
chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely(425,6);
now,(209,6)he found himself hard by the very latitud(233,6)longitude
where his tormenting w(75,6)ad been inflicted;(322,11) vessel had
been spoken which (636,7)very day preceding had actually encountered
Moby Dick;—a(428,13)ll his successive meetings with various ships
contrastingly concurr(380,6)show the demoniac indifference(77,6)which
the white(993,6) to(293,7)hunters, whether sinning o(11,6)ed(993,6)st;
now it was(629,6)there lurked a something i(937,6)old man’s eyes,(139,7)(66,7)hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting
polar star(85,7)(845,8) the livelong, arctic, six months’ night
sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now
fixedly gleamed down up(553,7)constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It
domineered above them so(776,7)all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,
fears, were fain to hide beneath(68,7)souls, (655,6)t sprout forth a
single spear or leaf.

In t(986,6)reshadow(484,6)terval too,(724,6)umor, forced or natural,
vanished. Stubb no(1023,7)trove to raise a smile; Starbuck(42,8)
(42,10)check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed
ground to finest dust(267,6)powdered, for the time,(711,8)clamped
mortar of(526,8)iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly mov(476,6)ut the
deck, ever consciou(848,10)(820,11)despot eye was (600,6)m.

But did you deeply scan him in his(350,7)ecret confidential hours; when
he thought no glance but on(115,9)him; then you would have seen that
even as(803,8)eyes so awed(778,6)rew’(276,6) inscrutable Parsee’s(122,7)
awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.
Such an added, gliding strangeness began to inves(377,6)thin Fedallah
now; such ceaseless shudderings shook(286,8)(443,7)men looked dubious
at(322,6)half uncertain, as it(666,7), whether indeed he(968,6)a mortal
substance, or else a tremulous (916,6) cast up(552,6) deck by(307,6)unseen
being’s body. And(631,6)(64,7)was always hovering there. For not by
night, even, had(307,9)(722,7)(226,6)ly been known to slumber, or go
below. He(595,7)stand still for(679,6): but never sat or leaned; his wan
but wondrou(634,7)did pl(131,6)say—We two watchmen(79,7)rest.

Nor, at any(1011,7)by night or day coul(711,6)mariners now step(364,9)(978,7)unles(775,6) was before them; either(232,6)ing(936,8)pivot-hole,
or exactly pac(382,7) planks between two undeviating limits,—the
main-mast an(180,7)izen;(565,9)they saw him(139,13)the
cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced(610,14)(714,6)f to step;
his hat slouched heavily over hi(422,6); so(824,6)however motio(321,6)he
stood,(29,9)the days and(415,6)s(802,7)dded on,(77,7)e had not swung
(358,7)hammock; yet hidden beneath(770,7)louching hat,(296,6)(506,6)never
tell unerringly(945,8), for all this,(223,9)(959,6)really closed at
times; or(1009,9)he was(760,7)intently scann(894,7)m; no matter,
though he stood so(446,7) (440,7)(145,6) whole hour (429,7)stretch, and
the unheede(336,7)-damp gathered in beads of dew(746,8)at stone-carved
coa(620,6)hat. The clothes(476,6)the(845,7)had we(346,6) next day’s
sunshine dri(603,8)him; and so, day after day,(512,10)(21,7)night;
he went no more(476,11)(832,8); whatev(372,8)nted from the cabin
(180,7)ing he sent for.

He ate(362,9)ame open air;(710,6)(509,8)two only meals,—breakf(914,7)
dinner: supp(509,6)n(735,6)(811,6); nor reaped his beard; which darkly
grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over,(71,7)still
grow idly on at naked base, (612,7)perish(524,6)the (180,6)verdure. But(654,9)is(625,7)lif(721,6)now become one watch on deck(477,6)(714,7)the
Parsee’s mystic(46,7)was without intermission as his own(976,6)these
two(334,7)seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long(97,6)vals
some passing unmomentous(899,7) made it necessary. T(917,6)such a potent
spell(140,8)secretly to jo(946,7)twain; openl(731,7)(163,7)awe-struck
crew, they(216,8)pole-like asunder. If by day(41,6)chanc(258,11)
one word; by(1007,6), dumb men were both, so far as concerned the
slightest verbal(400,6)change. At times, for longest hours,(450,9)a
single hail(209,8)tood far part(618,10)starlight; Ahab in his
scuttle, the (564,6) by the mainmast; but(739,6) fixedly gazing upon each
other; as if(980,8)(79,7)Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in(146,6)(694,10) his abandoned substance.

And yet, somehow, did Ahab—(210,6) own proper self, as daily, hourly,
and every instant, commandingly reveal(751,6)his subordinates,—Ahab
(784,7)an independent lord;(331,13)ut(66,6)lave. Still again both(71,8)yoked together(695,6)an unseen tyrant driving them(101,6)lean
shade sid(28,7) solid rib. For be this(477,8)what he may, all rib and
keel was(64,7)Ahab.

At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
from aft,—“Ma(938,6)mast-heads!”—and all through(83,7)y, (305,6)fter
sunset(284,6)fter twil(888,6)the same(120,7)(476,6)hour, a(193,6)striking
(176,7)helmsman’s bell,(172,10)—“What d’ye see?—sharp! (7,6)”

But when three or four days had slided by,(168,7)meet(441,7)
children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen(597,6)monomaniac
old man (648,7)distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly
all excep(487,6)Pagan harpooneers; he(100,8)to doubt, even, whether
Stubb and Flask might not will(850,6)overlook(673,6)ight he sought. But
if these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from
verbally express(813,8), however his actions(167,7)seem(999,6)nt them.

“I will have(766,11)(183,6)(752,7)whale myself,”—he said. “Aye! Ahab
must(68,10)doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of
basketed bowlines(553,6)sending a h(826,6)oft,(84,6)a single sheaved
block, to secure to(896,7)in-mast head, he received the two ends(994,7)
downward-reeved rope(695,6)attaching one(333,6)s (186,6) prepared a pin
for the other end, in order to fasten it(951,8)rail. This done(228,6)
that en(804,6)in his(265,7)nd sta(285,6)besid(449,6)pin, he looked round
upo(59,6)crew, sweeping from(202,8)(172,9); pausing his glance long(71,6)Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah(1009,6)then
settl(90,8)firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the
rope, sir—I give it into thy(606,6), Starbuck.” Then arrang(210,7)
person i(108,6)(631,6), he g(773,8)word (448,7)(819,6)oist hi(832,7)s
perch(105,10) be(898,7) one wh(642,8)(608,6)rope at last; and
afterwards stood near it. And thus(740,7)one(761,6)cli(195,6)rou(335,6)
royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad(334,10)sea for miles and(10,6),—ahead,
astern, this side,(433,7)at,—with(298,7)wide expanded circle commanded
at so great a height.

When in working(954,6)(710,8)s at some lofty almost isolated place in
the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold,(250,6)ailor at sea is
hoisted up(754,6)at spot(241,6)sustain(436,6)re by(445,9); under these
circumstances, its(974,7)ed end on deck is always giv(262,6)strict
charge to(253,6)one man who has(438,6)pecial watch of it. Because in such
a wilderness of r(891,7)(299,11)ose various different relations
aloft cannot(175,8)be infallibly discerned by what is seen of(802,6)at
the deck(1005,6)whe(970,6)deck-ends(44,7)s(781,6)s are(821,7)every few
minutes cast down from the(352,7)ings, it would be but a natural
fatality, if, unprovided(843,6)a constant(341,6)man(551,6)(534,8)(559,6)
sh(94,6)y(666,6)careless(356,8)the crew be(170,6)adrift and fall all
swooping(615,6)e sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in(890,6)matter were not
unusual; the only strange thing about(384,6)seemed to be,(727,6)Starbuck,
(852,7)(70,6)(74,7)(621,10)d ever ventur(68,6)oppose him with
any(114,6)i(468,6)slightest degree approach(240,7)decision—one(547,6)ose
too(655,8)faithful(694,6)(553,6)look-out he had(211,11)doubt
somewhat;—it was(269,8)(239,7)this w(827,7)ver(227,6)he (461,7)select
for (42,6)(512,6); freely giving(28,6)hole life into such an otherwise
distrusted person’s hands.

Now(597,6)first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere(239,8)be(817,6)re ten(778,8);(434,6)(323,7) red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
incommodiously close round the manned mast-hea(931,6)whalemen(492,7)se
latitud(141,13)ese birds came wheeling and screaming(107,7)his
head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a
thousand feet straight up(418,6)the air; then spiralized downwards, and
went eddying again(164,10) head.

But with his gaze fixed up(681,7)dim and distant horizon,(486,6)(906,6)
not to mark(667,7)ild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked
it much, it being no u(472,6)n circumstance;(985,6)now (1009,11)least
heedful eye(856,11)see some sort of cunning mean(1007,7)(75,7)every
sight.

“Your hat, y(10,9)sir!” suddenly crie(615,6)Sicilian seaman, who
(204,6)posted a(172,6)mizen-(655,9), stood directly behind Ahab, though
somewhat lower than his level, and(461,6)a deep gulf of air dividing
them(505,7)already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes;(361,6)ong
hooked bill at(598,9):(132,8)(795,6), the black hawk(743,9)way with
his prize.

An eagle flew thric(965,8)Tarquin’(700,6), removing his cap to replace
it(270,6)thereupon Tanaquil, (672,6)fe, declared that(96,8)(676,7)be
king of Rome. But(628,6)b(305,6)(107,6)(35,7)the cap was(77,6)omen
accounted good. Ahab’s hat was never restored(345,6)wild(295,6)flew on
and on(933,6)it; far in advance(125,8)prow: and at last disappeared;
while from(46,6)oint(184,6)a(42,11)ance, a minut(436,8)spot was
dimly discerned, falling(87,8)at vast height into(602,6)ea.


CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Del(883,7)The intens(39,9)sailed on(641,6)ro(124,6)waves and days went by; the
life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung;(308,6)nother ship, most miserably
misnam(991,7)(164,7), was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were
fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some
whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the(379,8)of (9,7)r nine
feet; serving to carr(1016,7)pare, unrigged, or disabled boats.

Upon(460,6)tranger’s(176,7) were behel(289,6)shattered, white ribs, and
some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you
now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see(42,11)e peeled,
half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.

“Hast see(269,6)White Whale?”

“Look!” repli(559,7)hollow-cheeked captain(905,6)his taffrail(647,6)with
his trumpet (939,8)ed (845,7)wreck(139,9)killed him?”

“The harpoon is not yet forged(1004,6)ever will do that,” answer(737,6)
other, sadly glancing(698,6)a rounded hammock (534,7)deck, whose
gathered sides some noiseless sailo(566,9)usy in sew(663,6)gether.

“No(183,8)!” and snat(411,6)Perth’s levelled iro(338,7)the crotch, Ahab
held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in(593,6)hand I hold
his death! Tempered in bloo(571,7)t(23,8)by lightning are these
barbs(486,6)I swear to(54,7) them triply(127,6)at hot place behin(413,6)fin, whe(87,6)(641,12) most feels his accursed life!(541,7)n God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—point(406,6) the
(498,7)—“I bury but one of five stout men, who(480,6)alive only

to his crew—“Are ye ready there?(374,7)the plank then(746,8)rail, and
lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—adv(829,7)towards the(826,9)with
uplifted hands—“may(238,8)urrection(606,6)he life——”

“Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like(649,11)(245,7)men.

Bu(186,6)suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the
sound of(72,6)plash(695,6)the corpse soon made as it struck(122,6)ea; not
so(102,6), indeed, but(769,6)some(98,8)flying bubbles might have
sprinkled her hull with(512,7)ghostly baptism.

As(288,6)now glided from the dejected Delight,(294,6)trang(384,6)-buoy
hanging (239,7)(310,6)’s stern came into conspicuous relief.

“Ha! yonder! look(13,7), men(452,9)a foreboding voice in her wake.
“In vain, oh, y(166,9)rs, ye fly our sad burial; ye(348,6)urn us your
taffrail to show(25,8) coffin!”


CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.

It was a clear steel-blue day(46,6)firmaments of air and sea were
hardly separable in(585,6)all-pervading azure; only(406,6)pensive air was
transparently pure(104,6)oft,(530,6)a woman’s look,(856,9)robust and
man-like sea heaved(590,6)long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s
chest in his sleep.

Hither(117,8)(13,7)on high,(649,8)the snow-white wings of small,
unspeckled birds; these were the gentle though(368,6)the feminine air;
but to and fro(367,6)e deeps, far down(23,8)bottomless blue, rushed
mighty leviathans, sword-fish(347,6)sharks;(359,8)(168,12)(328,7)
troubled, murderous think(249,8)the masculine sea.

But(226,7) thus contrasting within(951,6)(24,8) was only in shades and
shadows without; those two seemed one; i(65,11)the sex, as it were,
that distinguish(456,6)m.

Aloft, like a royal cza(769,6)king(714,6)sun(114,8)giving this(461,7)
air to(19,6)bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the
girdling line(535,8)horizon, a soft(784,6)remulous motion—most seen
here(80,7) equator—denot(697,7)fond, throbbing trust(940,6)loving
alarms(910,7)which(970,6)oor(189,7)gave her bosom away.

Tied up(945,6)wisted; gnarle(271,6)knott(939,8)wrinkles; haggardly firm
and unyielding; his eyes glow(285,6)ke coals, that still glow(807,7)
ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth(858,8)clearnes(911,8)
morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow(508,6)e fair girl’s
forehead of heaven.

Oh, immortal infancy(905,6)innocency(850,8)azure! Invisible winged
creatures(254,6)frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of ai(722,6)sky! how

their old sire; sporting(646,6)the circle of singed locks(673,7)grew on
the marg(830,7)at burnt-out crater of his brain.

lovely aromas(783,6)at enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a
moment,(793,6)ankerous thing in(781,6)oul. That glad, happy air(918,6)
winsome sky,(115,14)trok(232,6)caress him;(363,6)tep-mother world,
so long cruel—forbidding—now threw affectionate arms(777,7)his stubborn

the sea; no(463,7)ll the Pacific contain such wealth as(786,6)one wee
drop.

Starbuck saw the old man; saw(271,6)how he heavily(771,21);
and he seemed to h(175,6) his own true(269,8)he measureless sobbing
that stole out(964,6)e centr(978,7)e serenity around. Careful not to

Ahab turned.

“(299,8)!”

“Sir.”

“Oh, (25,9) it is a mild, mild wind(634,6)(23,6) looking sky. O(421,6)

“Oh, my Captain!(12,12) noble soul! grand(945,6)eart, after all!

“T(67,8)(78,11). I(86,7)een them—some summer days(853,6)e

vivac(285,6) wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
cannib(448,7)me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back
to dance him(366,6).”

“’Tis my Mary,(9,8) herself! She promised(941,6)my boy, every(288,8),(884,8)be carried(876,6)e hill to catch the first glimpse of

But Ahab’s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
cast his last, cindered apple(346,8)soil.

“What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing(51,6); what

half-cut swaths—(236,8)!”

But blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.

Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over(237,8)other side; but started at
two reflected, fixed eyes(202,7) wat(453,6)re. Fedallah was motionlessly
leaning(119,6)the same rail.


CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First Day.

That night,(123,8)mid-watch(784,11)old man—as his wont at
intervals—stepped forth(703,6)the scuttle in which he leane(802,7)went
to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
up(756,6)ea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some
barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that
peculiar odor, sometimes(628,6)great distance given(309,7)by the living
sperm(107,6), was palpable to all(550,8)ch; nor was any mariner
surprised when, after inspecti(988,7)compass(901,6)t(493,8)dog-vane,
(23,9)ascertain(58,8)precise bearing of(755,6)dor as nearly as
possible, Ahab rapidly orde(339,6)e(412,8)course to be slightly
alter(559,8)(738,6)il(37,8)hortened.

The acute policy dicta(234,8)se movements was sufficiently vindicated
at daybreak,(402,8)sight of a long sleek(997,8)sea directly and
lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil(760,6)resembling(1009,8)pleated(1017,6)y
wrinkles bordering it,(379,6)olished metallic-like marks of some swift
tide-rip, at(988,6)outh(203,6)deep,(400,6) stream.

“Ma(1009,6)mast-heads! Call all hands!”

Thun(150,7)with the butts(520,6)ree clubbed(52,6)pikes(306,8)forecastle
deck, Daggoo rous(530,8)leepers(94,6)such judgment claps(907,6)they
seemed to exhale from(600,6)cuttle, so instantaneously did they appear
(199,8)ir clothes(409,7)ir(247,6).

“What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to(736,6)ky.

“Nothing, n(9,6) sir!” was(774,6)ound hailing down in reply.

“T’gallant sails!—stun(11,6) alow and aloft(974,6)on both sides!”

All(828,6)being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
sway(224,6)m(219,8)main royal-mast head; and in a few mo(886,6)they were
hoist(73,9)hither, when, while but two third(597,7)e way(226,11)
(43,6)pe(798,6)ahead throug(657,6)horizontal vacancy between the
main-top-sail and top-(357,7)-sail, he raised a gull(874,6)cry(950,7)
air. “There she blows!—t(17,15) A hump like a snow-hill! It is
Moby Dick!”

Fired by th(108,6)which (744,7)simul(712,10)taken up(48,8)three
look-outs,(1014,6)en on deck rush(815,6)the rigging to behol(895,6)famous
whale(806,6)had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained(770,6)inal
perch, some feet abov(615,6)other (171,11)Tashtego standing just
beneath him on(278,6)ap(533,8)(437,12)mast, so that the Indian’s
head was almost on a level with Ahab’s heel. From this heigh(75,6)whale
was now seen(214,6)mile or so(644,6), at every roll(701,8)sea revealing
his high sparkling hump(955,6)regularly jet(809,7)s silent spout into
the air. T(909,6)credulous mariners it(568,8)the same(72,14)they
(477,12)ago beheld(739,7) moonlit Atlantic and(344,7) Oceans.

“And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men
all around him.

“I saw him(442,8)that(202,6)instant, sir,(500,6)Captain(661,6)did(337,6)I
(124,6)out,” said(620,9).

“No(557,6)(85,12); n(22,11)—no(842,6)doubloon is mine, Fate
reserv(358,7)(36,9)for me. _I_ only;(286,12)could have raised
the White Whale first. There she blows!—t(17,17)(34,8)
(34,6)(51,7)again(47,8)(13,6)” he(392,6), in long-drawn, lingering,
methodic tones, attuned t(615,6)gradual prolongings(909,8)whale’s
visible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails! Down
(972,12)(24,7)Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay
on boar(508,7)keep(897,6)hip. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;
steady, man, (13,6)(340,8)go flukes! No, no; only black water! All
ready th(179,7)(115,6)?(207,9), s(217,7)! Lower me,(215,13);
lower, (7,6)—quick, quicker!” and he slid through the air(426,8)deck.

“He is heading straight to leeward(835,6)(931,8)Stubb, “right away from
us; cannot(696,6)seen(347,9) yet.”

“Be dumb, man(448,13)e braces! Hard dow(62,6)helm!—brace up!
Shiver her!—s(12,11)So; well that! Boats,(530,6)!”

Soon all(373,11)but(551,9)’s were dropped;(43,13)(622,6)
set—(66,8)paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shoot(731,6)
(335,7); and Ahab(373,9)the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up
Fedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.

Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows spe(573,14)sea;
but(726,6)slowly they neared the foe. As(24,13)him,(229,6)cean grew
still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves(40,9)a
noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At lengt(768,6)breathless hunter
came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling
hump was distinctly visible, sliding alo(494,7)sea as if an isolated
thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,
greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of(934,6)lightly
proj(243,7)head beyond. Before it, far out o(993,7)oft Turkish-rugged
waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky
forehead, a musical(863,10)playfully accompany(837,8)shade; and
behind(631,6)blue (147,6) interchangeably flowed(612,7)nto the moving
valley of(537,6)teady wak(99,6) on either hand bright bubbles arose and
danced by(608,6)ide. But these were broken again by the(908,7)toes of
hundreds of gay fowl softly feather(262,9)ea, alternate wi(765,6)ir
fitful flight(197,6)like to some flag-staff rising(416,6)the painted hull
of an argosy(986,6)tall but shattered pole of a recent lance (609,7)ed
(92,9)(530,6)whale’s back(353,6)at(431,6)vals one(685,8)cloud of
soft-toed fowls hover(836,9)to and fro skimming(239,6)a canopy over
the fish, silently perched and rocked(749,6)is pole(598,6)(973,6)ail
(384,7)s strea(104,10)pennons.

A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested
(842,7)d(839,6)ale. No(865,6)(854,6)bull Jupiter sw(245,7)away with
ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering
eye(710,6)way(848,6)nt upon(827,6)aid;(628,6)smooth bewitching flee(212,6)
(975,9)straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that
great majesty Supreme! did surpass (307,6)orified White Whale as he so
divinely swam.

On each soft side—coincident(846,9) parted swell, that but once
leaving him, then flowed so wide away—o(104,7)brigh(106,6)(845,6)whale
shed off enticings. No wonder there had been(959,6)among the hunters who
namelessly transport(732,7)allured by all(737,6)serenity, had ventured
to assail it; but had fatally found(261,6)quietude bu(666,6)vesture of
tornadoes. Yet calm,(223,9)(15,7)oh,(732,6)! thou glidest on, to all
who(558,9)first time eye thee, no matter how many in(420,6)same way
thou may’st have bejuggl(1015,7)destroyed before.

And thus, throug(520,6)serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,(416,6)
waves whose hand-clappings were suspend(407,6)exceeding rapture, Moby
Dick moved on, still withholding from sigh(389,6)full terrors of his
submerged trunk(394,6)rely hidi(586,7)wrenched hideousnes(65,8) jaw.
But so(1022,7)for(794,6)(100,6)m slowly rose(147,6)the water; for an
instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s
Natural Bridge, and warningly w(912,8)s bannered flukes(537,6)e air,
the grand god revealed himself, sounded(94,7)ent out of(361,6).
Hover(114,6)halting(137,6)dipping (294,7)wing(1002,8)ite sea-fowls
long(178,6)lingered ov(1006,6) agitated pool(876,6)he left.

With oars apeak(256,6)paddles down(112,6)sheet(670,8)ir sails adrift(255,6)three boats now(602,6)y floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.

“An hour,” said Ahab, stan(714,6)ooted in(400,6)oat’s stern; and he gazed
beyond(297,7)ale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces(506,6)ide wooing
vacancies to leeward. It was only an (645,7)(661,7)ga(157,7)eyes seemed
whirl(192,6)un(191,9)head as he swep(878,6)watery circle. The breeze
now freshened;(404,6)ea began to swell.

“The birds!—t(11,9)” cried Tashtego.

In long Indian file, as when herons tak(629,18)birds were now
all flying(349,9)Ahab’(417,6)(409,6)when within a few yards(190,6)
fluttering(692,10)wat(702,6)re, whee(321,11)and(331,6), with joyous,
expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could
discover no sign(994,8)sea. But suddenly(439,7)peered down(941,6)own
into its depths, he profoundly saw a(958,7)living spot no bigg(157,8)a
(993,6)weasel(232,7)wonderful celerity uprising(951,6)magnifying as it
rose, till it turned(994,6)then(351,6)(458,6)plainly revealed two long
crooked rows of(517,6), glistening teeth,(1002,6)ing up from the
un(342,8)able bottom(837,9)Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw;
his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending(532,6)the(988,6)of(452,9)
The gli(621,8)(109,6)yawned benea(57,8)oat like an open-doored marble
tomb(729,6)g(451,6)one sidelong sweep(666,6)his ste(732,7)ar,(623,6)whirled
the craft aside(310,8)is tremendous apparition. Then, call(360,6)on
Fedallah to change places(130,8)m, went forward to(228,7)ws, and
seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars(68,6)tand by to stern.

Now, by reason(393,6)is timely spinn(980,10)(375,9)upon its axis,
its b(73,7)anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet
under water(970,6)as if perce(901,6)t(427,6)ratagem,(666,10)(892,7)that
malicious intelligence ascribed to(368,6)sidelingly transplanted
himself,(926,6) were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head
lengthwise(685,17).

Throug(828,6)t(12,6);(9,8) every plank and each rib, it thrilled for
(139,12)(337,9) obliquely ly(752,6) his back, in the manner of a
biting shark, slowly and fe(281,9)aking (480,7)s full within his
mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into
the open air, and one(653,6)e teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish
pearl-whit(58,9)insid(72,9)jaw wa(883,6)in six inches of Ahab’s
head(129,6)reach(168,7)er than that. In(1023,6)attitud(724,6)White Whale
now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With
unastonished eyes Fedallah gaze(162,7)cross(1016,7)arms; but the
tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over(607,6)other(907,7)s to ga(554,6)
uttermost stern.

And now,(947,7)both elastic gunwales(105,6)springing(824,6)d out, as the
(685,6)dallied(952,8)e doomed craft(686,6)is devilish way;(668,6)rom his
body being submerged(883,17), he could not be darted at from
(924,6)ws, for(938,7)w(198,7)almost(581,11)him, as it were(145,6)while(705,6)ther boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis
impossible to withstand, then it was(867,6)monomaniac Ahab, furiou(726,6)
this tantalizing vicinity(191,6)s foe, which placed him all alive and
helpless(390,6)e very jaws he hated; frenz(448,9)all this, he seized
the long bone(487,6)his naked hands(1001,6)w(781,6)strov(254,6)rench i(418,7)its gripe. As now he thus vain(58,9),(995,9)slippe(554,9)m; the
frail(679,10)bent in, collap(414,6)nd snapp(427,8)oth jaws, like an
enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the(716,7)completely in
twain(960,6)locked themselves fast again(380,8)sea, midway betwee(926,6)two floating wrecks. These(23,6)ed asid(279,7)broken ends drooping, the
crew a(175,6)stern-wreck cl(961,7)to the(992,9)(294,7)triv(30,7)hold
fast(43,8)oars to lash them across.

At(709,6)preluding moment, ere(949,9) was yet(397,10)(746,6)the first
to perceiv(54,6)whale’s intent, by(384,10)y upraising(773,8)head, a

it(764,8)(502,7)oat had shaken of(255,7)old o(988,6)jaw; spilled him
(165,7)it, as he leaned(520,8)push;(810,6)o he fell flat-faced up(89,6)
sea.

Ripplingly withdrawing(923,8)s prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and dow(843,8)
billows(190,6)(755,8)am(481,6) slowly revolv(88,8)whole spindled body;
so(709,6)when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet(360,8)the water—the now r(683,6)swells, with all their confluent waves,
dazz(354,7)broke against it; vindictively tossing(73,7)shivered spray
still hig(638,13)air.* So, in a gale(603,7)ut half baffled Channel(357,8) only recoil(494,6)the base(770,8)Eddystone, triumphantly to
overleap its summit(263,6)(186,7)cud.

*This motion is peculiar(682,8)sperm(832,6). It receives its
designation (pitchpoling)(667,6)its being like(767,9)at preliminary
up-and-down poi(220,10)whale-l(693,6)(638,6) exercise called
(117,11), previously described. By t(228,11)(90,9) must best
and most comprehens(493,6)view whatever objects may be encircl(830,6)m.

But soon resum(854,8)horizontal attitude(940,12)swam swiftly round
and(10,6)(728,6)recked crew; sideways churn(649,7)(764,6) i(841,7)engeful
wake, as if lash(170,7)self up to (688,6)another (263,6)re deadly
assault. The sigh(876,9)splintered boat seem(479,6)madden him, as the
blood of grapes(103,6)ulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants(508,7)
book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab(844,6)smothered(564,8)foam(816,7)
whale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he
could(315,7)keep afloat, even(681,8)heart of such a whirlpool(278,6)at;
helpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least
chance shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah
incur(826,7)and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other
drifting end, (289,6)not succor(68,6)more than enough was it for them to
look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling w(612,6) White W(478,6)
aspect(471,6)so planetarily(874,6) the ever-contracting circles he made,
that he(734,8)(969,10)ly swooping upon them. And (551,7)(283,10)boats, unharmed,(884,7)hovered hard by;(907,7)they dare(320,6)pull into
the eddy(950,6)rike, lest that should be(926,6)ignal(345,8) instant
destruction(968,8)jeopardized castaways,(845,6)and all; nor(899,6)at
case(480,7)they(425,11) hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,
they remained (320,6) outer edge(158,8)direful zone, whose centre had
now becom(246,6)old man(841,7).

Meantime, f(780,9)eginning all this had been descried(46,10)ship’s
mast heads;(594,6)quaring her yards, she(74,6)orne down(537,9) scene;
an(990,6)now so nigh,(446,6)Ahab(354,6)e water hailed her!—“Sail on
the”—bu(499,7)moment a breaking sea dash(339,6)him(248,6)Moby Dick, and
whelm(984,6)(546,9)time. But struggling out of it again(846,6)chancing
to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,(191,9)(222,6)hale!—Drive him
off!”

The Pequod’s prows were pointed(376,6)(233,9)up the c(850,6)(952,7),
she effectually parted(120,7)it(126,7)(525,6)his victim. As he sullenly
swam off,(562,6)oats flew to the rescue.

Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded(773,10)(146,6)
brine c(448,6)in his wrinkles; the long tens(950,7)Aha(103,6)dily
strength did cra(485,7) helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a
(807,6)ly(794,8)crushed(661,8)bottom of(231,13), like one trodden
under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails cam(414,6)
him, as desolate sounds(968,6)out ravines.

But(968,6)intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
abbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense
to one deep pang(582,6)sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
through feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such(145,7), though summary
in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it,(501,7)ir life-time
aggregate a(133,7)age of woe, wholly made up of(313,8)aneous
(411,8)ies; for even(103,10)pointless centr(802,6)ose noble natures
conta(657,7)entire circumferences(121,6)ferior souls.

“The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising(825,6)draggingly leaning on
one bended arm—“is it safe?”

“Aye, sir, for it was not darted;(673,7)s it(131,8)Stubb, showing it.

“Lay it before me;—any missing men?”

“One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars(156,7)and here are
five men.”

“That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!
(7,6) going to leeward(621,6); what a leaping spout!—Hands off(988,6)me!
The eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set(867,6)ail; out oars;
the helm!”

It is ofte(575,6)case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked
up by another boat, help to work(83,6)second boat; and(114,6)hase is
thus continued with(283,6)is called double-banked oars. I(597,6)thus now.
Bu(247,6)added power o(976,6)boat did not equal(42,23)
whale(694,6)he seemed to have tre(135,11)his every fin; swimming with
a velocity which plainly showed,(364,6)if now, under these
(962,6)stances, pushed on,(310,11)would prove an indefinitely
prolonged,(95,6)t a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long
a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining a(632,6)oar; a thing
barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,
then, as it sometimes happens, offere(600,6)most promising (179,6)ediate
means of overtaking(652,10). Accordingly(366,6)boats now mad(287,6)her,
and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts(653,8)wrecked
boat having been previously secured by her—(820,7)n hoisting(633,6)(354,6)to her side, and stacking her canvas high up(33,7)ideways
outstretching it(893,6)stun-sails, like the(899,8)jointed wings of an
albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At
the well known, methodic(449,6)vals(769,6)whale’s glittering spout was
regularly announced from(537,6)anned mast-heads; and when h(852,8)be
reported as just gon(202,6), Ahab(894,7)ta(282,7)tim(377,7)then pacing
the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so(575,6)as(287,6)ast second(554,7)
allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose i(77,6)doubloon now?
D’ye see him?” and i(652,6)reply was, No, sir!(976,6)ghtway he commanded
them to lift him to his perch. In this way(562,6)ay wore on; Ahab, now
aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly(328,7) the planks.

As h(246,6)thus walking, u(523,8)no sound, except to hail(513,6)en(126,6), or to bid them(855,6) a sail still higher(42,8)spread one to a
(36,6)greater breadth—thus to and fro(523,7), beneath his slouched hat,
at(970,6) turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped
upo(866,6)quarter-(632,6)and l(396,6)re reversed; broken bow to shattered
stern. At(651,6)he paused before it(817,6)as in an already over-clouded
sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes(365,6)across, so over the old
man’s face(192,7)now stole some such added gloom(838,6)is.

Stubb saw him(196,6)(1002,6)perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
evince(390,9)unabated fortitud(1008,9)us keep up a valiant place in
his Captain’s mind, he advanced(419,6)eye(744,8)wreck exclaimed—“The
thistle the ass refused; it prick(559,7)mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”

“What soulless thing i(311,6) that laughs(496,8)a(638,6)? Man, man! did
I not know thee brave as fearless fire ((555,7)mechanical) I could
swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor(142,6) should be hear(653,9)a
wreck.”

“Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen,
and an ill one.”

“Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the god(331,6)k to speak outright to
man, they(766,6)honorably(43,15); not shake their heads, and
give an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two ar(559,6)opposite poles

peopled earth, nor(332,6)nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How
now? Aloft there! D’ye see him? Sing out for every spout(1008,8) he
spout ten times a second!”

The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.
Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.

“Can’t se(480,6)(184,6)now(1004,6)—too dark”—cried a voice from the air.

“How heading when last seen?”

“As(870,7)(854,6)—stra(720,7) leeward.”

“Good! he(731,6)travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and
top-gallant stun-sails, Mr.(960,9). We must not run over him(160,7)
morning; he’s making a passage(282,6)and may heave-to a while. Helm
(565,7)keep her full(255,7) the wind!—Aloft! come down!—(169,6)ubb, send
a fresh hand to the fore-mast hea(855,7)see it manned till(198,8).”—Then advancing towards the doubloon in(848,6)ain-mast—“Men,
t(640,8) is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here(140,6)the White Whale is dea(992,7)then, whosoever of ye first raises him,

divided among all(177,6)! Away now!—the deck(136,6)in(755,6)!”

And so saying, he placed himself half way with(405,7)scuttle, and
slouching his hat, stood t(367,9) dawn, except(907,6)at intervals
rous(65,6)(116,6)to see how the(860,6) wore on.


CHAPTER 134. The Chase—Second Day.

At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually(685,8)afresh.

“D’ye(138,6)im?” cried Ahab after allow(908,6)little space for the light
to spread.

“See nothing, sir.”

“Turn up all hands(974,7)ke sail! he travels faster than I thought
for;—the top-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on h(205,6)
night. But no matter—’tis but resting(223,9)rush.”

Here be it said,(747,6)this pertinacious pursuit of one particular
whale, continued through day into(516,6),(927,7)(28,6)(535,6)into day, is
a thing by no means unprecedented (706,7)South sea fishery. For such is
the wonderful skill, prescience of experienc(775,6) invincible

accurately foretell both the direction in which he will(455,9) to

pilot,(284,6)about losing(131,6)(319,6)coast, whose general trending he
well knows(650,6)(247,9)desires shortly to return to again, but at
some further point; like as(819,7)ilot stands by his compas(118,7)take(675,6)precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in orde(958,6)more

exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable
from(545,7)statements, are many collateral subtile mat(580,6)ouching the
chase(241,7)les.

The ship tore on; leaving(736,7) furrow(361,8)sea as when a
cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share(406,6)urns up the level
field.

“By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but(658,6)swift motio(778,11)ck
creeps up one’s leg(355,6)tingles at the heart. This(253,6)and I are two
brave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,
o(307,9),—for by live-oaks! my(45,6)’s a keel. (105,8)we g(969,6)gait
that leaves no d(722,6)hind!”

“There she blows—(10,9)!(11,11)—right ahead!” was now the
mast-head cry.

“Aye, aye(385,17)I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on and split
your spout, O(890,6)! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your
trump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off(30,6)blood, as a miller
shuts his watergate up(409,8)tream!”

An(614,7) did but speak out for well nigh a(1000,8)crew. The frenzies
(650,7)(868,6)had by(688,6)time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine
(41,7)anew. Whatever pale fear(721,6)forebodings some(775,7)m might
h(705,7)t before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the
growing awe of Ahab, (904,6)ey(78,6)broken(780,9)on all sides routed,
as timid prairie hares(329,6)scatter(169,7) the bounding bison(358,6)hand
of Fat(349,6)snatched(403,7)eir souls; an(379,7)e stirring perils(294,7)
previous day; the rack(324,7) past night’s suspens(322,6) fixed,
unfearing, blind, reckless way in which(151,7)wild craft went plunging
towards its flying mark; by(214,8)se things,(228,7)hearts(379,7)owled

T(594,9)one man, not thirty. For as th(32,6)ship(905,6)hel(854,7)all;
though it was put together of all contrasting(348,7)—oak(702,6)maple,
and pine wood; iron(734,6)pitch(745,6)hemp—yet(426,11)ran into each
other in(180,9)concrete hull,(278,8)hot on its way, both balanced
and directe(725,9)long central keel; even so,(781,8) individualities

fatal goal(807,7)Ahab(963,7)one lord and keel did point to(551,6) rigging lived(761,6)mast-heads, like the top(1011,6)all palms, were
outspreadingly tufted with(761,6)and legs. Clinging to a spar(39,6)one
hand, some reached forth(677,6)the(44,7)impatient wavings;(30,6)s,
shad(648,6)eir eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out o(598,6)rocking
yards;(509,9)spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for
(384,6)fate. Ah! how they still strove through(891,6)infinite blueness to
seek out(386,6)h(870,6)at might destroy them!

“Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after
the lapse of(400,6)minutes sinc(524,6)first cry, no more had been heard.
“Sway me up, men; ye have(38,6)deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd
jet(846,6)way(777,6)then disappears.”

It was(950,8); in(767,7)headlong eager(845,6)the men had mistaken some
(612,6)(356,6)for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
hardly ha(347,6)(716,9)his perch; (35,7)w(80,7)rope belay(982,6)its
pin on deck(413,6) he struck the key-note to an orchestra,(542,7)ade the
air vibrate as(916,6)the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant
halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was(502,6), as—much nearer to(835,6)hip
tha(872,6)place(78,6)e imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—(544,9)
bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not
by(140,6)eaceable gush(227,6)at mystic fountain in his head, did the
White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but (108,7)far(811,6)wondrous
phenomenon of breaching. Rising(432,6)his utmost velocity from the
furthest depth(736,7)Sperm(153,7)thus booms his entire bulk(318,6)the
pure element of air(877,6)piling up a m(268,8)of dazzl(808,6)am, shows
his(475,7)(502,7)distan(491,6)seven miles and more. In those moments,
the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; i(963,6) cases,
this(334,10) i(251,6)act of defiance.

“There she(380,7)es! t(20,18)”(940,9)cry, as(528,7)
immeasurable bravadoe(982,6)(541,12)tossed himself salmon-like to
Heaven. So suddenly seen i(815,6)blue pl(379,7)the sea(416,6)relieved
against(877,6)till bluer marg(56,11)ky(545,6)spray(746,6)he raised,
for th(397,8), intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
stood(325,7)gradually fading and(11,9)wa(711,7)its first sparkling
intensity,(589,10)m mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.

“Aye,(852,7) your last(668,8)sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour
and thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at(933,6)ore. The boats!—stand by!”

Unmindful(478,8)tedious rope-ladders(506,9)hroud(999,7)men, like
shooting stars, slid(902,9)eck, by the isolated backstays and
halyards; while(263,7)less dartingly(218,6)(605,6)rapidly was dropped
fro(915,6)perch.

“Lower away,” he(355,6), so soon as he had (892,6)d his boat—a spare one,
rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck(735,7)hip is thine—keep
(623,10)t(391,8)(427,6)keep near them. Lower, all!”

As if to str(749,6)quick terror in(670,6)m(353,7)is time being the(729,6)
assailant himself(636,11) had turned(981,6)was now coming (918,7)
three crews. Ahab’(301,6) was central; and cheering his(549,6)he told
them he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up
to his fore(43,6)a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
such a course excludes the(252,8)onset(439,10)whale’s sidelong
vision. But ere that close(100,6) was gai(348,10)hile yet all three
boats were plain a(132,6)ship’s(37,6) masts (250,7)eye; the White Whale
churn(374,6)mself(541,6)furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,
rushing amo(578,7)(159,7)ith open jaws(553,6)a la(46,6)tail, offered
appalling battle on every side(548,6)heedless of the iron(1005,6)ed at him(978,6)(57,6)boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank

wheeling like trained chargers in(879,7)eld(412,6)(471,6)for a(503,6)

But at la(527,6)his untraceable evolutions,(618,16) so crossed

that way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sigh(135,6) savage
tha(740,6)em(983,6)d teeth of sharks!

Caught(180,6)wisted—corkscrewed(806,8)maze(1018,9)line, loose harpoons
and lances, with(766,8)ir bristling barbs and points, came flashing
and dripping up to the chock(946,9)bows of(849,8)boat. Only one

the sea; (994,6)s all(954,6)again. That instant, the White Whale made a
sudden rush amo(337,7)remaining tangl(552,10)other lines; by so
doing, irresistibly(315,9)the(703,6)involved boats of Stubb and Flask
towards his flukes; dash(270,6)m toge(125,7)ke two rolling husks on a
surf-beaten beach(390,12)diving down in(648,7)sea, disappear(798,6)a
boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space(343,6)odorous cedar chips of
the wrecks danced round an(10,7),(204,7)he grated nutmeg in a swiftly
stirred bowl of punch.

Whil(61,6)two crews were yet circling(1005,8)waters,(784,6)ing out after(653,6)evolving line-tubs, oars(710,6)(502,6)floating furniture, while

man’s line—now parting—admitted of his pu(639,6)(587,9)creamy pool to
rescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
concreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up (848,7)
Heaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
from(814,10)the White Whale(934,8)his broad forehead against its
bottom(912,6)sent it, turning over(618,6)ver,(926,10)air; till it fell
again—gunwale downwards—and Ahab an(139,6)men struggled(520,6)rom under
it(892,7)seals(26,6)a sea-side cave.

The first uprising momentum of(856,6)hale—modifying its direction as he
struck(320,6)urface—involuntarily launc(323,6)m along(285,6)o a(852,7)

came sideways smiting(686,8). But soon, as if satisfied(904,6)his work
for(922,6)time was done, he pu(737,9)pleate(739,11)through the
ocean(738,6)trailing after hi(832,6)intertangled lines, continu(834,6)
leeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.

As before(917,6)attentive ship having descr(240,6)e whole fight,(927,6)(320,6)bearing down (893,7)rescue(946,6)dropping a boat, picked up the
floating mariners, tubs, oars(1012,6)whatever else could be caught at,
and safely land(178,6)m on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists(70,6)ankles; livid contusions; wre(875,7)arpoons and lances;
inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oar(61,6)planks; all these
were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen
any one. As(961,6)Fedallah(1008,6)ay(507,9)so Ahab was now found grimly
clinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy(482,6); nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s mishap.

But when h(861,6)help(247,6)the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
instead of standing by himself he still half-hung(63,6)the(557,9) of
Starbuck, who had thus far bee(48,6)foremost to assi(233,6). His ivory
leg had(51,6)snapped off, le(893,6)but one short sharp splinter.

“Aye, aye, (146,10)’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner(190,6)e
will;(871,6)ould old(532,6)had(43,6)d oftener than he has.”

“The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I
put good work into that leg.”

“B(777,6)bone(639,8)(97,6) I hope(105,8)Stubb(754,6)true concern(301,7)! and all(326,9)(828,6)pieces,(62,6)!—d’ye see it.—But(887,6)with a

nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze(167,11)n his own proper and
inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape

“D(81,6) leewar(551,6).”

“Up helm, then; pile (892,8)ail again, ship keepers! dow(927,6)rest of

“Sir?”

“My body,(559,8)t thee. Give me something for a cane—ther(663,6)t
shivered lance will do. M(315,10)men. Surely I(150,6)not seen him yet.
By heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”

Th(711,6)man’s hinted thought was true. Upon(464,7)ing the company, the
Parsee was(262,8)re.

“The (28,6)!” cried Stubb—“he must(359,6)been caught in——”(59,7)black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
forecastle—find him—not gone(9,9)!”

But quickly they returned to him with the tidings(588,9)(218,7) was
nowhere to be found.

“Aye, sir,” sai(253,9)(235,7)amo(333,7)tangles of your line—I(393,8)
I saw him dragging unde(993,6)_My_ line! _m(11,7)? Gone?—gone? What mean(188,7)little word?—What
death-knell rings in it(678,6) old Ahab shakes as if he were(992,6)elfry.

the unmeasured globe; yea (301,6)ve straight through it, but(82,6)slay
him yet!”

“Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck;
“never, never wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’ name no more of
this(683,6)’s worse than devil’s madness. Two days chased; twice stove
to splinters; thy very leg once(110,6)snatched from(901,6) thee(49,6)evil

and blasphemy to hunt him more!”

“(531,8), of late I’ve felt strangely moved(910,7)e; ever since that
hour we both saw—thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes. But in this
matter(998,8)whale, be the front(285,6)y face to me a(361,6)pal(315,7)is

whole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehears(458,6)thee and me a billion

me, men. Ye see an(998,8) cut down(656,8)stump; leaning on a shivered
lance; propped up(32,6)lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but
Ahab’s soul’s a centipede,(202,6)moves upon a hundred legs. I feel
strained, half(687,6)ded, as ropes(275,7)ow dismasted frigates in a
gale; and I may look so(664,6)ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack(57,6)till
ye(27,6)_that_, know(401,6)(231,7)hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe
y(414,6),(786,6)e things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!
For ere they drown,(7,6)ing(84,8)will twice rise(501,9)urface;
then(26,6)again, to sink(819,9)more. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s
floated—tomorrow(120,6)(980,7)third. A(247,9)he’ll(144,6)once more,—but
only to spout his last! D’ye feel brave(318,6)brave?”

“As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.

“And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab.(369,6)as the men went forward, he
(48,9)on: “T(441,22)! And yesterday I talked(876,6)ame
to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek
to drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The
Parsee—the (11,6)!—gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but still was

might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of
judges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks(355,6)ain. _I’ll_,(8,7) solve it,
though!”

When dusk descended,(120,7)al(284,6)(266,6)in sight to leeward.

So(739,10)(515,7)il(54,6)hortene(985,7)everything passed nearly as on
the previous night; only(140,6)sound of hammers(83,6)the hum(297,7)
grindston(466,6)heard till(106,8)daylight,(774,12)toiled by
lanterns in the complete and careful rigging(413,8)spare boats and
sharpening their fresh weapons for(895,6)orrow. Meantime,(493,8)(795,6)
keel of Ahab’s wrecked craft(156,6)arpenter made him another leg; while
(707,6)as o(210,6)n(644,6)efore, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his
scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its
dial; sat due eastward(273,9)earliest sun.


CHAPTER 135. The Chase.—Third Day.

T(329,6)n(399,11)third day dawned fair and(392,6)(650,6)(688,13)
solitary(629,6)-man a(356,6)fore-mast-head was reliev(938,6)crowd(934,8)

“D’ye see him?” cri(412,7); bu(503,6)(916,10)not yet(918,9).

“In his infallible wake, (1005,6)(70,6)follow that(30,9)at’s all. Helm

Aloft there! What d’ye see?”

“Nothing, sir.(17,11)! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See(431,6)un!
Aye, aye, it must be so. I’ve oversailed him. How, got(495,6)tart? Aye,
he’s chasing _me_ now; not I, _him_—that’s bad; I(530,6) have known it,

by last night. About!(592,6)! Come down, all of ye, bu(214,6)regular look

Steering as she had done,(968,9) had been somewhat o(998,6)Pequod’s
quarter, so(979,6)now being pointed(997,8)reverse(695,7)ion(104,6)braced

white wake.

“Agains(489,6)(208,6)e now steers for the open jaw,” murmured Starbuck to
himself, as he coil(128,7)new-hauled main-brace(187,10)rail. “God
keep us(419,6)already my bones feel damp within m(897,8)rom the inside
wet my flesh. I misdoubt me(383,6)I disobey my God in obeying him!”

“Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
“We should meet him soon.”

“(913,10)sir,” and straightway(350,10)di(112,6)’s bidding(248,6)once
more Ahab swung on high.

A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three(731,6)s off the
weather bow,(177,6)des(333,6)the spout again(470,6)instantly(480,9)
(88,6)mast-heads(105,7)shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had
voiced it.

“Forehead to f(12,8)I(429,6)thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck

nay, to-night, whe(73,8)it(79,7) lies down(167,6), tied by head and
tail.”

He gave(139,6)ord(678,6)(534,7)azing round(364,7)as steadily lowered
through the cloven blue air to the deck.

In due tim(113,6)boats were(77,8); but as standing in his shallop’s
stern(390,6) just hovered(339,10)point(803,8)(615,6)t, he waved(148,7)
mate,—who held on(854,9)tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him pause.

“Starbuck!”

“Sir?”

“For(72,6)hird(238,6)my soul’s ship starts(517,8)is voyage, (80,8).”

“Aye, sir,(690,6)wilt(870,6)it so.”

“Some ships sail(791,6)their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,

Their(28,7)met;(288,7)eyes fastened;(378,9)’s tears the glue.

“Oh, my captain(12,12)!—noble heart—go no(7,7)t!—see, it’s a
brave man that weeps; how gre(295,7)agony(697,8)persuasi(725,6)n!”

“Lower away!”—cried Ahab, tossing the mate’s arm(527,6)him. “Stand by

In an instan(426,6)boat was pull(1022,10)close unde(731,6)stern.

expectant,—fixed at(176,6)op of a shudder! Fut(256,6)ings swim b(810,6)me,
as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the pa(318,6)somehow grown dim.
Mary, girl!(598,6)fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see
but thy(694,6)(94,6)wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem
clearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming? My legs
feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats
it yet? Stir thyself,(969,9)!—stave it off—move, move! speak
aloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft
(55,6)—keep(965,8)nest eye up(57,7)boats:—mark we(497,7)whale!—Ho!

to the red flag flying(700,8)main-truck—“Ha! he soars away with
it!—Where’(965,6)old man now? see’st(640,6)(858,6)ight, oh Ahab!—(788,7),
(797,8)”

T(253,8) had not gone very far, when by a signal from(176,7)(410,7)s—a
downward pointed arm, Ahab knew(1003,6)(341,9) had sounded; but
intending to be near him(985,8)next rising, he held on(666,6)ay a
little sideways(168,10)vessel;(488,6)echarmed crew maintaining the
profoundest silence, a(460,6)head-beat waves hammered and(13,9)(553,6)s(465,6)opposing bow.

“Drive, (581,6)in your nails, oh ye(90,6)! (552,6)ir uttermost heads
(640,6)them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and
no hearse can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”

Suddenly(801,6)aters around(151,6)slowly swelled in broad circles; then
quickly upheaved, as if(445,10)sliding(621,6)a submerged berg of ice,
swiftly(536,7)(311,7) surface. A low rumbling(624,6) was heard; a
subterraneous hum(303,6)then all(614,6)(395,6)breaths; as bedraggled(919,6)trailing ropes,(530,7)rpoon(14,7)lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,
but obliquely(872,10)sea. Shroud(338,6)(489,6) drooping veil of mist,
it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air(239,11)fell swamping
back in(338,7)deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards,(527,12)flash(126,6)
an instant like heaps of fountain(59,6)n brokenly sank(229,6)shower of
flakes, leav(939,7)(593,6)ing(495,8) creamed(104,6)new milk (667,9)
marble trunk of(705,6)hale.

“Give way!” cried Ahab(593,8)oarsmen(472,6)the boats dart(357,6)ward to
the attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corro(478,6)
him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possess(87,6)all the angel(78,7)fell
from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his(951,6)
white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;
(884,6)d on, he came churn(110,8)tail amo(477,7)boats(908,6)once more
flailed them apart; spilling out the(341,7)(883,10)(839,10)two
mates’(448,6)(935,6)dashing in one side(541,8)upper part(559,7)ir bows(937,6)(652,8)Ahab’s almost without a scar.

While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopp(723,8)strained plank(256,7)as the
whale swimm(239,8)(218,8)m, turned(673,6)showed one entire flank as he
shot by(325,7)gain; at(646,6)moment a quick cry went up. L(980,6)round
an(10,7)(802,8)fish’s back; pinioned in(552,6)urns upon(11,7)in
which, dur(976,8)past night,(923,10) had ree(503,7) involutions of
the lines a(1000,6)him(62,6)half torn body(1007,8)Parsee was seen; his
sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes(367,7) full(216,6)old
Ahab.

The harpoon dropped(644,6)his hand.

“Befooled, b(10,7)!”—draw(651,7)a long lean breath—“Aye,(194,7)! I see
thee(453,6).—Aye(722,6)thou goest before(840,6)this, _this_ then i(602,6)hearse(514,6)thou didst promise. But I hold thee(499,8)last letter(395,6)y word. Where(93,7) second (100,6)? Away, mates,(572,8)ship! those
boats are useless now; repair(1017,6)if ye can in tim(246,7)return to me;
if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men!(701,7)rst th(903,6)at but

not other men, but my arms and my leg(1002,7)so obey me.—Where’(1019,11)? gone down(951,6)?”

But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if b(969,6)on escaping with the
corpse he bor(582,7)(54,6)(921,6)rticular place(845,8)last encounter
had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now(709,6)
steadily swimming forward(707,6)had almost passed(576,9),—which thus
far (142,9)sail(853,7)the contrary direction to him, though for the
present her headway(86,11)topped. He seemed(179,10)with his
utmost velocity(926,6)now only int(403,9)pursuing his own straight
path(188,8)sea.

“Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third
day, to desist. See!(406,11)seeks(1006,6)not. It(976,6)ou(295,6)(757,6)
madly seekest him!”

Setting sail(995,8)ris(625,6)nd(134,6)lonely(844,6)was swiftly impelled
to(565,8), by both oar(822,6)canvas. And at(649,6)when(1007,6)was sliding
by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish(332,9)’s face as he
leaned over(208,6)ail, he hailed him to tur(614,6)(112,6) about, and
follow(617,6)(421,8)(245,7), at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,
he saw Tashtego, Queequeg(950,6)Daggoo, eagerly mounting(393,8)three
mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rock(823,11)two staved boats
(879,6)had but just(1021,6)hoisted(505,8)side(760,6)were busily at work in
repairing them. One aft(360,7)other, through the port-holes,(413,7)sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying
themselves on deck among bundl(61,6)new iron(641,6)lances. As (401,7)all
this;(562,6) heard the hammers(965,8)broken(326,6); far(229,6)(39,8)
seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied(778,6)now mark(211,6)at(762,6)ane or flag was gone from the main-(527,9), he shou(450,6)
(614,10)who had(489,6)gained that perch, to descend again for another
fla(671,7)a(270,7) and nails(695,6)so(231,7)t(681,8)mast.

Whether fagged (975,7)three days’ running chas(619,7)the resistance to
his swimm(723,11)knotted hamper he bore; or w(118,7)it was some
latent deceitfulnes(524,6)malice in him: whichever was true, the White
Whale’s way now began to abate, as it (516,6),(423,10)boat so rapidly
nearing him once more; though indee(637,6)w(112,7)last start had not
been so long a one as before(593,6)still as Ahab glided ov(924,7)waves
the unpitying sharks accompanied him;(484,8)pertinaciously stuck to
(227,8)(41,9)continually bit (717,7)p(981,6)oars,(639,6)the blades
became j(554,6)and crunched(636,6)left small splint(917,11)sea, at
almost every dip.

“H(332,7)m not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull
on! ’tis(461,6)etter rest(539,6)shark’s jaw tha(671,6)yielding water.”

“But a(158,8)bite, sir(607,6)thin(266,7) grow(234,6)(874,7)(12,7)!”

“They will(532,6)long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he
muttered—“(800,8)thes(191,7)(864,6) to feast o(869,6)whale or on
Ahab?—But(104,9) Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm! take the

to(859,7)ws(46,8)(753,6)f(614,6)boat.

At length a(447,6)craft was cast to one side(616,6)ran ranging along with
the White W(916,7)flank, he(1008,7) strangely oblivious of its
advance—(132,7)(343,6)sometimes will—and(938,6)was fairly with(740,6)
smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from(443,10)’s spout, curled
round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
with body arched back(935,6)both arms(375,7)wise high-lifted (440,6)
poise, he darte(148,6)fierce iron(1013,6)his far(25,7)r curse in(69,7)hated(677,6). As(125,6)steel and(46,7)sank(118,7) socket, as if sucked
into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically roll(186,6)
nigh(530,6) against(670,8), and, without staving a hole in it, so
suddenly canted(733,7)at over, that had it not been for the elevated
part(828,8)gunwale to(551,6) he then clung,(620,7)ould once more have
been tossed(364,9) sea. As it was, three(936,15)—who foreknew
no(261,6)precise instan(160,9)dart(883,6)were therefore unprepared for
its effects—these(48,6)flung out; but so fell(297,6), in an(114,9)two
(278,6)m clutch(353,7)(292,8)agai(627,7)rising to its level on a
combing wave, hurl(422,6)mselves bodily inboard(519,6); the third man
helplessly dropping astern,(198,6)till afloat and swimming.

Almost simultaneously(601,6) a mighty volition of ungraduated,
(381,7)(56,6) swiftness, the White Whal(911,9)through the weltering
sea. But when(578,6)cried out(868,9)teersman to take new turns with
the line(995,7)old it so;(949,6)ommand(770,7)crew to turn round on their
seats(578,6)tow(817,10)up(1007,8)mark(387,6)momen(916,6)treacherous line
felt(864,6)double strain(89,6)ug, it snapped in(881,6)mpty air!

“What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis who(622,8); oars!(6,6)
Burst in upon him!”

Hearing(182,8)mendous rush(997,8)sea-crashing boat(465,6)whale wheeled
(312,6)to present his blank forehead at bay(844,6)in(271,6)evolution,
catching sigh(963,9)n(161,7)black hull(152,9)hip; seemingly seeing
in i(390,6)source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a
larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore dow(339,7)its advancing
prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

Ahab staggered; his hand smote his(334,9). “I grow blind; hands!
stretch out before me(635,6)I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”

“T(477,8)! T(359,7)!”(900,7)(816,6)inging oarsmen.

“O(616,10) Slop(279,6)wards(948,6)y depths, O sea,(510,7)re it be for
ever too late,(1019,6)may slide this last, last time(715,8)s mark! I
see:(542,9)!(10,10) Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”

But as the(229,8) violently forc(267,6)ir boat through the
sledge-hammering seas(818,6)(399,7)whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
burs(89,9), and in an instant almos(907,7)temporarily disabled boat
lay nearly level with(959,6)aves; its half-wading, spl(1003,7)crew,
trying hard to stop the gap and bale ou(882,6)pouring water.

Meantime, for(1009,6)one beholding(206,8), Tashtego’s mast-head (325,6)
remained suspended i(502,6)hand; an(665,6)red flag,(210,7)rapp(892,6)m as
with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing(683,6)the
bowsprit beneath, caught s(123,6)f th(832,6)-coming monster just as soon
as he.(944,12)(614,6)(955,7)Up helm, u(9,6)! Oh, a(756,6)sweet powers of

woman’s fainting fit.(133,10)I say—ye fool(783,7)jaw(929,6)jaw! Is
thi(884,6)end of all my bursting prayers?(25,8)life-long fidelities?
Oh, Ahab(6,6), lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up
helm again! He turns to meet us(333,6)his unappeasable brow drives on
towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God(567,7) by me
now!”

“Stand not(24,6), but(41,7)under m(104,6)ever you are(885,6)will now
help(666,6); for(677,8)too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning
(612,7)Who ever helpe(755,9)or kept(770,6) awak(172,7)Stubb’(841,6)unwinking eye? And now po(150,8) goes to bed(829,6)a mattrass(214,6)is

(219,13)(831,8)Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I c(843,7)assassins
of as good a fellow as(289,6)spouted up his ghost. For all that, I(192,6)
yet ring glasses(193,6)ye,(224,7)ye but hand the cup(989,6)oh! o(8,6)(213,20)(560,6)there’ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye
not, O Ahab! Fo(612,6)off shoes and jacket to it; le(505,8)die in his
drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death(620,6)gh;—cherries!
(10,9) (10,10)Oh, Flask, for one red(33,6)y ere we die!”

“C(75,7)? I only wish(796,7)e(559,6)where they grow. Oh,(800,8)I hope
my(672,6)mother’s drawn my part-pa(120,6)this; if not, few coppers will
now come to her(191,6)the voyage is up.”

From the ship’s bows, nearly(568,7)e seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
bits of plank, lances(719,6)harpoons, mechanically retained in their
hands, just as(295,6)had darted f(171,7)ir various employments; all
(31,6)enchanted eyes intent(992,6)the(682,8)which(86,6)side to side
strangely vibrating his predestin(19,7)ead, sent a broad band of
overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,
swift vengeance, eternal malic(594,7)(765,6) whole aspect(374,6)spite of
(1021,8) mortal man could do,(507,6)olid white buttress of his forehead
smote(554,12)starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell
fla(394,10)ir faces. Like dislodged trucks(158,6)heads of the
(588,7)eers aloft shook (80,9)bull-like necks. Through the breach,
(602,6)eard(528,6)aters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.

“T(817,7)! T(162,6)rse!—(811,6)cond(19,8)” cried Ahab(704,9) boat;
“its wood(398,7)only be American!”

Diving beneat(196,6)settling ship(448,6)whale ran quivering along its
keel; but turning under(246,6), swiftly shot to(1008,6)urface again, far
off the other(498,6)but within a few yar(426,6)Ahab’s boat, where, for a
time, he lay quiescent.

“I turn my body(301,10)sun. What ho, Tashtego! let m(380,6) thy
hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel;
an(395,7)god-bullied hull(48,7)firm deck(871,6)haughty helm, and
Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious(570,7)must(170,6)en perish(65,6)without me? Am I cut off(577,10)last fond pride of meanest
shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on(16,8)life! Oh, now I feel
my topmost greatness lies in (29,13)ief. Ho, ho!(738,6)all your
furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billow(409,6)y whole foregone

and since neither can be mine,(800,8)then tow to pieces, while still
chasing thee, though tied(263,7)(21,7) damned(291,6)! _Thus_, I give up
the spear!”

The harpoon was darted;(976,6)tricken(366,6) flew forward; with igniting
velocity(756,6)ine ran thr(165,6)he grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stooped to
clear it; he did (17,10)but the flying turn caught him round the
n(1007,9)voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstr(334,7)ir victim, he was
shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew(47,7) gone. Next instant, the
heavy eye-splice in the rope’s final end(347,6)(112,11)stark-empty
tub, knocked down an oarsman(878,6)smit(537,7) sea, disappeared in its
depths.

For an(168,13) tranced boat’s(224,6)stood(634,6);(667,7)urned. “The
ship? Great God, where is(570,6)hip?” Soon they(522,9)dim, bewildering
mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as(318,8)gaseous Fata
Morgana; onl(638,6)uppermost masts(455,8)water;(849,7)fixed by

But a(565,6)last whelmings intermixingly pour(329,6)mselves over(110,6)unken head(944,8)Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches(996,7)

which calmly undulated,(63,6)ironical coincidings,(203,9) destroying

Now small fowls flew sc(995,8)(925,9)yet yawning gulf; a sullen
