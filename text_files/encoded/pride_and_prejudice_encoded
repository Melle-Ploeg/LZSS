_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving
by allowance” and(26,8) with personal love.” This(80,13)applies
to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
numerous authors who are the objects(53,8)(155,9)affection, it
brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as
to their best work than(190,18)ose othe(173,11)loved “by
(347,11)by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
proper thing to love them. A(336,10)sect--fairly large and yet
unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be
found partisan(389,9)claim to primacy of almost every on(486,8)
novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger
Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted
critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with
difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
in interest, has devotees who exalt above all th(697,9)its exquisite
delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly
theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost
wickedly destroyed all romantic(244,9) by expressly admitting that
Edmund only took Fanny(899,9)Mary shocked him(144,8)at Fanny might
very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes(272,9)characters of Mrs. Norris and
others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and
Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
not want them._

_I suppose, however, tha(254,8)jority of at least competent votes
would, all things(210,9)ed, be divided(1754,8)_ Emma _(592,8)present
book; and(219,13)vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss
Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge
of vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the
more popular;(831,14)d by the time of (1332,8)osition seen rather
mor(1933,9)world, and had improved her general, though not her most
peculiar and(695,10)istic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the
Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On(1234,10) hand,
I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It
seems to me the most perfect(406,8)st(240,15)(25,10)
eminently quintessential(403,8)author’s works; and for this contention
in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show
cause._

_In(1684,11)place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the
reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
when Miss Austen was(125,8)twenty-one;(631,8)it was revised and
finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till
1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this
combination(857,8)fresh and vigorous projec(37,8)youth(1802,9)
critical revision of middle life, there(428,8)traced the distinct
superiority in point of construction, which, as it (752,11), it
possesses over all(872,10)s. The plot(1043,13)elaborate, i(1991,9)regular enough for Fielding; hardly a(1775,10),(20,9)n incident
could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia
and Wickham is not, like that of(2000,10)and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de
théâtre; _it connects(1557,8)in the strictest way with the cours(1396,8)
story earli(671,8)brings about the denouement with complete propriety.
All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.
Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the
same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the
hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which(371,8)transactions between
Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the
intrigue of_ Emma, _but(64,13)it in a(223,8) which(1075,10)think
the best featu(1921,8)at otherwise admirable book. Although(1324,12)
always liked something(1999,8)misunderstanding kind(305,8)afforded her
opportunities for(1100,8)play(1221,8)(2021,13)incomparable talent to
be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here(791,10)perfectly
natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given
by(1005,8), an(62,9)awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from
the gradual transform(1506,9)Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive
aversion to actual love(1616,23) the all-grasping hand of
the playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare
say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or
garish(1496,12)the footlights, the(1497,10)-scheme too subtle and
delicate for pit and gallery. But if the(1054,9)were made, it would
certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses(1809,17)
which, sometimes disguis(636,10)conveniences of which the novelist can
avail himself, appear at once o(1570,8)age._

_I think, however(1877,9)the thought will doubtless seem heretical to
more than one school of critics, that(242,13) is not the highest
merit(443,8)oicest gift,(1113,8)(233,8). It sets off his other gifts
and graces most advantageously(1968,8)critical eye; and the want of it
will(400,11)mar those graces--appreciably(310,9)not quite
consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-(135,8). But a very badly-built
novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous(754,10), or which
displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all
faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot
acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the
ability whic(1687,13) has shown in working out the story, I for one
should put(1204,21) _far lower if it did not contain what
seem to me the very masterpieces of(1851,12)’s humour and of her
faculty of(1204,11)creation--(79,13)who may indeed admit John
Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,
but who, in one instance (1260,9), and (560,8)in others, are still
superior to them._

_T(1430,12)istic(288,27)re s(1456,12) (1456,8)
that they are,(136,8), at all times easier to apprehend than to
express, and at any particular time likely to be differently
(79,9)ed by(27,10) persons. To me thi(493,9)seems to possess a
greater affinity,(1437,8)whole, to that of Addison(191,8) any other(1943,8)numerous species of this great British genus. Th(209,10)ces of
scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,
obvious enough; t(104,13) of sex does not(440,11)count for much,
for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in
Jane(887,10)genius(88,10)(1460,12)hing mannish, much that was
masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of
common subdivision(61,12)--demureness, extreme minut(104,9)touch,
avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a
certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those
who judge grossly to contrast the good nature(711,12)with the
savagery of Swift, the mild(351,8)(1503,12)(56,8) boisterousness
of Fielding and Smollett, ev(55,12)ferocious practical jokes that
her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much
protest. Yet, both in Mr.(962,9)and in(1717,13)(416,8)(656,9)a
restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in
roast(274,8)cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,
(991,10) could push this taste further(2036,8)lady(86,13)
nineteenth; and no doubt(1814,15)principles, as well as her heart,
would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate
husband in the_(1080,11) _who describes, with all the gusto and(18,8)
innocence(326,8)world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play
at blind-man’s-buff. But another(163,11) _letter--(1562,8)the damsel
of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shape(1983,8)assures her selected
Mentor that “he admires you(138,12)s _mightily”--might have been
written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the
days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while(1849,9)other hand, some (I
think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touche(1144,16)’s
own, such(659,8)satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over
her son(1609,8)is wor(133,8)al” is one(473,8)most misuse(688,8)
English language, especially when, by a(1548,9)and gratuitous
falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and
snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If (365,8) means
the percep(142,8)“(455,10)side,” the sense(31,9)accepted hells
beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and
that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be(207,9), then
every man and woman who(79,8)a fool, who does not care to live in a
fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of(1877,8)and(1146,10) and life, is
a cynic. A(1261,8)at sense(1876,13)certainly was one. She may even
(981,9) on(1257,9)(1524,8)sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she
took an epicurean(1706,11) dissecting, in display(15,8)setting at
work her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take thi(1821,9),
and I do not think at(1513,9)worse of her for it as a woman, while she
was immensely the bett(54,14)n artist._

_In respect(96,8)art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed
that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfec(1012,10),
combined with the narrowness(253,9)ield;” and he has justly added that
we need not go beyond(521,9)comparison to the art of a miniature
painter. To m(431,9)latter observation quite exact we must not use the
term(88,10) in its restricted(1249,8)and mus(509,8)rather of Memling
at one end(1893,8)history of paint(1372,8)Meissonier at(1670,10), than
of Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so(908,8) that I should
myself(228,8) word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a
microcosm, the cosmic quality of(1526,8)t least as eminent as the
littleness. She(1221,10)touch what(886,9)not feel herself called to
paint;(249,13)sure t(64,8)could not have painted(96,17)
(96,22) touch. I(207,14)remarkable that in two very
short periods of writing--one of about three years, and ano(569,8)not
much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a
single failure(202,8)possi(191,9)the romantic paste in her
composition was defective:(819,9)always remember that hardly
anybody born in her decade--that(784,8)eighteenth-century
seventies--independently exhibited the full(188,10)quality. Even Scott
required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and
German to enable them to chip the classical shell.(1817,13)was an
English girl, brought up in a country retirement,(1031,8)time when
ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might
pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subjec(436,8)
gravest fear(57,8)their studies, their way(12,9)conduct were
(81,8)to all those fantastic limits and(1397,9)ions again(207,8)
Mary Wollstonecraft protest(1680,8)better(1818,8) sense than particular
taste or judgment(449,13), too, drew back(239,9)(353,12)
touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey
even in a black one._

_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which
only genius knows. The one was humanity, and(1669,10) was art. On the
first head(1385,15)make a mistake; her men, though limited, are
true, and her women are, in the ol(1897,9)“absolute.” As to art, if she
has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree(792,8)akes
the false(50,9)of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any
Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously
piling up strokes(280,8)hope of giving a complete impression. You get
none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can
shape a real(105,11) ou(1484,9)rest. But with(1286,13)the
myriad, trivial, unforced(225,9)build up the picture like magic.
Nothing is false; n(18,10)superfluous. When (to take the present book
only) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.
Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. (54,8)(1040,9)
stirr(1751,8)ire), when Mr. Darcy “(1586,8)his coffee-cup back_
himself,” _the touch in each case is like (1915,8)Swift--“taller by the
breadth of my nail”--which(603,8)ed the half-reluctant Thackeray with
just and outspoken admiration. Indeed,(1520,11)as it may seem, I
should put(1869,13)as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her
to Addison in others._

_This Swiftian quality appear(874,9)(563,8)novel as it(35,8)
nowhere else(1202,8)character(786,8)immortal, the ineffable Mr.
Collins.(646,13)is really_ great; _far greater than anything(218,8)
ever did,(1158,8)great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has
been said that no one ever was like him. But(1445,8)first place,_ he
_(43,12); he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds
of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-(13,8)and
distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash,(1979,8),
to conclude that an actual(1088,13)was impossible or non-existent at
the end(1326,8)eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we
possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first
draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The
formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait
is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural.(833,12) is perfectly natural, and(23,11)alive. In fact, for all the
“miniature,” there is something gigantic(1920,8)way in which a certain
side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially(517,11)-century
(44,10)its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,
its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,
its selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech
or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled
with real(332,9)I should not wonder if many of these words and actions
are historically true._

_But the greatness of(1443,13)c(111,9)have been so satisfactorily
exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the
figure(128,9)Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like
(1632,12)himself, has been charged with exagge(1961,8)There is,
perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for(1799,9)ge; but it seems to me
(62,11)indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be(1374,11)
to find persons,(851,12)female(27,10)not necessarily of noble
birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,
as(397,15). A(1734,8) years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady
Powerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,
rich, long out of marital author(1157,9)so forth, had opportunities of
developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present
themselves now. As for(713,11), Miss Austen, and Mr. Darc(1319,8)ven
Miss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him
(669,8)“impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must
always(1019,10), a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her
or(909,8) there was no way(442,8)it for a man of sense and spirit but
the ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,
except for an excusable and not(1913,10) helplessness at the crisis of
the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the
consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that
even(616,12) has put into the mouth of any of her(737,10)s. It is
difficult to know whether he is most(802,11)when talking to his wife,
or when putting(1625,13)through his paces; b(1677,8)eneral sense(362,8)world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his
consolation(34,9)ormer when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,
do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.
Let us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;”(616,9)inquiry
to his colossal cousin as(263,8)compliment(1214,8)(1828,13)as just
related as made by(947,10)o(1922,15), “May I ask(541,9)these
pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or(819,8)
result of previous study?” These(860,9)thing(1431,8)give(1386,12)’s
readers the pleasant shocks, the(912,12)thrills, which are felt by
the (75,8)of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as
they(90,12) (90,15)(1233,9)English author of fiction
outsid(318,8)se four._

_The goodness(349,9)ino(998,12) in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been
already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beautie(1096,12)in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs(1840,8) we have
glanced at(131,9)is not easy to say(1184,9)s(1185,8)re exquisitely
amusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and
Lydia; but(135,12)very author, even of genius, who would have
differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and
vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon(1028,8)mon
weaknesses of woman at such (156,9) ages. With Mary,(1620,16)
taken rather less pains, though she (589,8) even more unkind to her;
not merely in the text, but, as we learn(1079,8)ose interesting
traditional appendice(1251,12)Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming
her privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of
first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of pla(48,8)
singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but
perhaps poor Mary was(425,8)the scapegoat(1403,8)sins of blue stockings
in that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate (1012,10)not
to exte(501,9) a shar(1529,9)resp(704,8)affection ((11,10)and
(37,8)of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.
Collins,(2026,10)draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish
that the exigencie(1379,9)story had permitted(820,13)to unite
these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mat(598,8)soothe
poor(1326,12)’s anguish over the entail(1558,9)Bingleys(669,8) Gardiner(18,10)Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de
Bourgh, Jane, Wickham(194,8)e rest, must pass without special comment,
further than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa(1127,8)
(1978,10), is just a little on the thither (1841,11) line between
comedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and
that(278,8) ((1290,8)omething of(1351,12)’s hesitation of touch in
dealing with young men appears) is a not much less(553,9)sketch in
(162,8)another. Only genius c(1680,9) made(371,11)what she is, yet
not disagreeable;(225,9)what he is,(490,9)investing him either with
a cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the
hero(704,9)heroine are not tints to be dismissed._

_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most(1643,12) of
(445,16)roes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,
whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into
comparison. It has(1190,10), I believe, been urged that his pride is
unnatural at first in its expression and later(28,8)yielding, while
his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I
cannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own accoun(1718,9)way in which
(220,10)had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and
nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its
sudden restoration to healthy conditions(1277,10)shock of Elizabeth’s
scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in
even our author is finer and more delicately touched(1432,10)change of
his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he
been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting
under his rejection, or suspicious (1963,9)girl had come
husband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent(670,9)
(712,8) feelings of a man spoilt(262,8)common sense, but not really
injured in disposition(1866,8)oroughly(853,8). As for h(174,9)in
love,(564,10) has given a(1802,8)n ex(93,8)(1787,8)causes of that
phenomenon a(2035,8)has(46,9)(688,10)of his unregenerate state,
only she(58,8)course not counted in what was due to her own personal
charm._

_The secret(169,8) charm many men and not a few women, from(1892,12)
herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather
to be felt than to be explained.(391,11)(255,10)belongs to the_
allegro _or_ allegra _divis(416,11)army of Venus.(206,12) was
always provokingly chary of description in regard(362,8)beauties; and
except the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate
(1653,9) a bright complex(713,9)was not very tall, we hear nothing
about her looks. But her chief difference from other(2040,8)(676,8)
lively type seems to lie(1753,10)he(1931,8)distinctly clever--almost
strong-minded,(1228,8)better sense(651,9)objectionable word--and
secondly(115,14)entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her
propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue(637,12)can give
at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never
“scratches,” and(27,10) attacks first. Some(1942,8)merest
obsoletenesses of phr(203,8)manner give one(618,8)of her early

or anybody(996,10)resents Darcy’s(832,8)ll-mannered(1452,9)ity with
as(1472,9) a(1813,8). (By the way, the reproach(1946,10)(88,10)s of
this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for th(1920,8)the same
kind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have
been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons
who ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the
injury done to Jan(1041,10)contempt shown to the (647,8)her family
aggravate this resentment(1255,8)healthiest way(1277,8)world._

_Still, all this(605,10)explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a
common form of(1268,8)oines, may perhaps consis(158,9)addition to her
playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and(792,9)disposition, of a
certain fearlessness very uncommon in(1644,13)her type and age.

that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with
(49,13)an. Though no(841,9)least “impudent(1777,9)ish grown,”
she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness(320,10). The(830,8)

invariably connected with the display of(1962,9)he other, or both of

(1883,8)I.]


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other(1869,10)daughters.

“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?”

(99,10) replied(216,9)had not.

“But it is,” returned she; “for (1354,10)has just been here, and she
told me all about it.(131,14)made no answer.

“Do not you(1364,9)know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.

“_You_(1433,9)tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”(841,16)

“He came down to see the place”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

This was invitation enough.

“Wh(1624,12)you must know,(375,11)says that (499,12)is taken
by a young man of large(915,9)from the north of England;(741,9)came
down on Monday in a chaise and four(265,17), and was so much
delighted with it(842,9)agre(23,8)Mr. Morris immediately(145,10)is
to take(1135,11) before Michaelmas, and some(1650,8)servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week.”

“What is his name?”

“Bingley.”

“Is he married or single?”

“Oh, single(467,11)to be sure! A(1351,12)(421,16); four or
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”

“How so? how can it affect them?”(1147,24)(1050,8)(860,10)“(67,8)you be so tiresome? You
(679,9) that I am thinking(2044,8)marrying one of them(326,8)that his design in settling here?”

“Design? Nonsense,(218,9)you talk so! (1214,9) very likely(1471,8)
_may_ fall in love with(149,12), and therefore(904,10)visit him as
soon as he comes.”

“I see no occasion for that. You(89,8) girls may go--or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
as handsome as any(226,10)Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the
party.(558,11), you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown-up(1872,10), she ought to give over(654,14)er own beauty.”

“In such cases,(106,13)not often much beauty to think of.”

“But(1467,20)indeed go and see(378,13)when(577,9) into
the neighbourhood.”

“It is more than I engage for, I assure you(141,8) consider your(289,10). Only think what an establishment it would
be for(944,13) Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new
comers. Indeed(1817,10)go, for it(786,9)impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not.”

“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say(447,14)ill be very
glad(1807,8)you; and I will send a few lines by you to(442,8)him of my
hearty consent to(1341,14)whichever he chooses of(1110,10)--though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”

“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others: and I am sure she(55,8)half so(1184,13)Jane, nor(30,8)
good-humoured as Lydia. But(1253,8) always giving _her_ the preference.”

“They have n(1663,11) much to recommend them(1796,12)e: “they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.”

“(1935,11)(1764,13)abuse your own children in such a way? You take
delight in vexing me. You(267,8) compassion on my poor nerves(796,9)mistake me(1251,9). I have a high respect for you(67,9) They
are my old friends(64,9)heard you mention them with(1219,9)ation
these twenty years at least.”

“Ah,(985,11) know what I suffer(1307,9)I hop(740,11)get over it, and live(972,8)many young men of four
thousand a year come into (1474,25)(1973,8)no use to us, if(212,8)such should come, sinc(908,11)not
visit them.”

“Depend upon i(1666,12)that when there ar(316,8),(1174,8)(75,10)
all.”

(632,10) was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-(470,13)had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope. She was(2033,9)of mean(93,11)ing,
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she
fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
(1993,9) married: its solace was visiting and news.

“I hope(1823,18)like it”(92,43)CHAPTER II.(106,16)](676,17)among the earliest of those who waited on(1978,12). He
had(1598,8)intended to visit him, though to the last(1647,8)assuring his
wife that he(960,8)not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his second (573,8) employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,--(494,34), Lizzy.”

“We are not in a way to know _what_(565,13)likes,” said her mother,
resentfully, “since w(92,10)(442,8)(1509,9)you forget, mamma(85,8)Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”

“I(1677,8)believe(61,11)will do any such thing. She has two nieces
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and(1952,8)no opinion
of her.”

“No more have I(367,8)(1535,10); “and I am glad to fi(259,8)you do
not depend on her (627,8)you.”

Mrs(1616,9)deigned(428,8)make any reply; but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one(1317,8)(1297,9).

“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”

“Kitty has no discretion in her cough(723,13)father; “she times
them ill(567,14)cough for my own amusement,” replied(220,9)retfully. “When
is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”

“To-morrow fortnight.”

“Ay, so it is,” crie(909,13) “and(778,11)does not come back till
the day before; so, it will be impossible for her(839,17), for
she will not know him(1860,8).”

“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and(954,10)
(1728,12)to _her_.”

“I(172,9),(808,11),(196,11), when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?”

“I honour your circumspection. A(429,10)’s(102,9)ance is certainly
very little. One can(320,9)what a man really is by the end of a

will take it on my(578,8)The girls stared at thei(942,8). (1230,12)said only, “Nonsense,

“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?(876,10). “Do
you consider the forms of(1645,9)tion(1694,8)e stress that is laid on
them, as (162,8)? I(527,8)quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books, and make extracts.”

Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
Bingley.”

“I am sick of (1061,11)(1310,10)is wife.(45,9)orry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I
had known as much this morning, I(1005,10) would not have called on
him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the(1141,14)now(833,8)astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.

“How good(55,8)in you(1651,9)(1556,11)! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to

CHAPTER III.(66,16)]

Not all that Mrs(1220,8), however,(860,10)assistance of her five
daughters, c(224,9)on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description(1914,15). They attacked him
in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
delight(1324,8)him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be(996,12) assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
danc(953,8)a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes(602,15)’s heart were entertained.

“If I can but see one of my (778,9) happily settled at Netherfield,”
said(880,12) to her husband, “and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”

In a few days(1429,13)returne(1916,12)(1227,14)sat about ten

window, that he wore a blue coat and(1436,19).

only once with Mrs. Hurst and(25,12)iss(1448,10)declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest(1483,9)vening in
walking about(1194,9), speaking occasionally to on(799,9)own party.
His character was(1398,8). He was the proudest, most (677,13)man in
the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his(1373,9)behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted(321,9)er daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of(1433,10), to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time,(1733,11)(116,8)
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation(772,16)(1082,12), who came from the dance for a few(1707,9)to press(1159,11) to join it.

“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you(226,10)about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance.”

“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
(577,10)ly(1356,17)my partner. At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman(1456,12) whom it(893,8)ot be a punishment to me to
stand up with.”

“I(55,14)so fastidious as you are,” cried(1268,10)“for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life as I have this(1295,8);(268,11)are several of them, you see,
uncommonly pretty.”

“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl(1801,12)(705,8)Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

“Oh, she is(1258,10)beautiful creature I ever beheld! But(497,10)one
of he(542,10)sitting down just behind you, who is ver(252,8), and I
dare say very (1497,9). Do let me ask(718,11) to (1730,9) you.”

“She is tolerable”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at(1427,10), till, catching her eye, he withdrew(1811,8), and coldly said,(197,18): but not(533,10)enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are(1667,9)
by other men(1240,10)better return to your(429,9)and enjoy her
smiles, for(954,8) wasting your time with me.”
(1545,12) followed his advice.(1669,11)walked off; and (1818,9)
remain(1304,8)no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which de(2028,8)in anything ridiculous.

The(1143,8) altogether passed off(1214,9)ly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her(1068,8)daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. (417,12)had danc(1666,8)her twice, and(269,9)been
distinguished by his(1642,8). Jane was as much gratifi(139,8)is as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.(528,10) felt Jane’s
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss(656,9)a(1344,10)
accomplished(1449,13)neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia(280,10)fortunat(986,12)be never without(2008,8)s(570,8)was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a
book, he was regardless of time; and on the(1257,9)occasion (906,8)
good deal of curiosity as(817,8)event of an(877,9)which had raised
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s
views(177,8)stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear(2038,8)my dear(357,11),” as she entered the room, “we hav(1218,8)most
delightful(1160,8), a most excellent ball. I wish y(1575,9)en there.
(991,9)so(1123,8), nothing(971,9) like it. Everybody said how well
s(1924,9); a(572,8)ingley thought her quite beautiful, an(1193,13)
(1193,9). Only think of _that_(313,9): he actually(1259,16)
twice;(1259,9)was the only creature(1047,8)room(449,8) asked a second
time. First of all,(38,10)Miss Lucas. I(324,8)vexed to see him stand
up(1416,9); but, (1730,9)he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane(598,8)was going
down the dance. So he inquired who(310,8), and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. Then,(20,9)third (110,8)d with Miss
King, and(64,9)fourth with Maria Luc(135,8)(37,9)if(36,8)Jane
again(72,14)six(71,8)Lizzy(102,10)_Boulanger_----”

“If(1170,8)had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,
“he would not hav(242,9)half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of
his(1621,9). O(666,9)had sprained his ancl(709,9)first dance!”(1123,14),” continued Mrs(1136,9) “I am quite delight(837,9)im. He
is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never
in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the
lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”

Here(1013,9)interrupted again.(1750,12)protes(28,9)st any
description of finery. S(1096,10)refore oblig(1005,9)k another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some
exaggeration, the shocking rude(56,8)Mr. Darcy.

“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is(1645,8)disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring
him! He walked here,(1283,8)walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not(713,9) enough to dance with!(1844,26), my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I(870,9)test the man.”

CHAPTER IV.(33,19)When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who(2040,10)cautious in
her praise(580,8)(1972,8)before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.

“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and(1107,8) saw such happy manners!(1385,8) ease,
with such perfect good breeding!”(172,9)also(1246,9),” replie(352,11), “which(204,8) (204,9)
likewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”

“I was(346,10) flattered by his asking me(688,10)a second time. I
did not expect such a compliment.”

“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. C(90,9)s always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
could be more natural than(243,12)you again? He c(1898,10)elp
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
very (1300,11)and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
stupider person.”

“Dear Lizzy(2024,9)you are a(422,8)eal too apt, you know,(114,9)people in general.
You(854,8)ee a fault in anybody. All the world are good and(234,10)
in your eyes(2044,9) heard you speak ill of a human being in my lif(776,9)ould wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I(639,8)speak
what I think.”

“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it
everywhere. Bu(287,8)candid without osten(96,8)r design,--to take the
good of everybody’(1191,12)and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,
too, do you? Their(1498,8) are not equal to his.”

“C(893,9)not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. Miss(1809,9)is to live with her broth(269,8)keep
his house(1707,8)am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her.”

(2023,10)listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to pleas(1063,12); and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sis(584,8)
with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was
very little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine
ladies; not deficient in good-humour when t(72,8) pleased, nor in the
power of being(1548,10) where they chose it; but proud and conceited.
(173,9) rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were(217,8)habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves and meanly of others(496,11) of a(82,8)able family(2038,8)north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories(268,8)at(893,8)rother’s(364,9)and their own(458,9)
acquired by trade.

Mr.(1155,10)nherited property(1641,8)amount of nearly a hundred
(462,15) from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it. (165,14)tended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a
good hous(329,9) liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easi(1232,8)his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder(205,8)days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
(373,8).

Hi(1810,9) we(1724,8)anxious for his having(420,10)(332,8)own; but
though(332,12)established only as a tenant,(1777,14)was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst(607,9)

look(487,15) House. He did (34,8)it, and into it, for half an
hour; was(1610,8) with the situ(1875,10)the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its pra(908,8) took it immediately.

(908,8), openness, and ductility(933,16)though no dis(122,8)
could offer a greater contrast to(818,8), and(69,8)with(843,8) he
never appeared dis(375,9). On the strength of Darcy’s regard,(1474,8)
had(1949,8)mest reliance(1840,9)his judgment the highest opinion. In
understanding, Darcy was the superio(359,15)by no means
deficient; but(63,11)clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious; and his manners(406,9)well bred, were not
inviting. In that(2031,9)his friend had greatly the advantage(1815,9)
was sure of being liked wherever he(443,9);(239,12)ontinually
giving offence.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
(759,9)istic(1171,15)ever met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;
there(47,10)no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquaint(1131,8)all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collec(1111,8)people

felt the smallest interest, and from none received either(364,8)on or
pleasure.(269,12) he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too
much.

(1871,10) and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they sh(468,9)object to know more of(249,14)was therefore
established as(108,13);(1768,8)ir brother felt authorized by such
(1935,12) to think of her as he chose.

CHAPTER V.(69,16)]

Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with(680,9) Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas(1003,10)formerly in trade
in(1169,8), where(964,8)made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The
distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgu(1959,10)business and(1979,8)residence in a small market town;
and, quitting them both,(1250,8)removed(2037,10)family to a house about
a mile from(361,10)denominated from that period Lucas Lodge;(403,9)
could think(1530,11)ure of his own importance, and, unshackled by
(267,8), occupy himself solely in being civil to(1455,9)world. For,
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
(1447,11)e was all(1296,11)to(1706,10). By nature inoffensive,
friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s(735,10)him
courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clev(1282,10)
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young(142,8)about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth’s(1056,9) friend.

That the Miss Lucases(1357,8)(1938,12)s(1468,8)meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary(1436,9) morning after the assembly
brought the former to(1297,11)to hear(961,8)communicate.

“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said(396,12), with civil
self-command, to(277,11). “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”

“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”

“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danc(1138,9)er twice. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he(1999,8) her--indeed, I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--(44,9)
about Mr. Robinson.”

“Perhaps(237,10)what I overheard betwe(1480,8)nd(67,13):(1114,8)
I mention it to you?(110,13)’s asking him how he liked our(1775,8)
assemblies, and whether he(1221,9)think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he th(737,10)prettiest? and his
answering immediately(1842,8)last question, ‘Oh, t(1064,9)(934,12),
beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”

“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does(626,8)
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”

“_My_(527,9)ings were more(271,8)purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said
(1011,9). “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”

“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vex(1860,9)
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to b(766,8)by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”

[Illustration: “W(49,28)”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.
“I certainly saw (556,10)speaking to her.”

“Ay(1421,10)she asked him at last(1129,14)Netherfield, and he
could not help (1015,10)her; but she said(1597,11)very angry at being
spoke to.”

“Miss(1681,8)(464,8)(1773,8)Jane, “that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably
(661,9).”

“I do not(1623,9)a word of it, my dear. If he had been so ver(77,11), he would have talked to(703,10). But I can guess how it
was; everybody says(728,8) is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
(1798,10)how that(828,11)does not keep a carriage, and had to come
to the ball in a hack chais(308,15)mind his not tal(646,8)(946,9)(474,8)Miss Lucas, “but I
wish(339,8)danced with Eliza.”

“Another time, Lizzy(554,8)her mother, “I w(683,9)dance with _him_,
if I were you(1272,9)liev(904,8), I may safely promise you _never_ to(90,12)him.”

“His prid(705,9)(231,13)(369,9)offend _me_ so much as pride
often does(945,10)there is an excuse for it. On(1826,9)wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If(302,8)o express it, he has a _right_
to be proud.”

“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive
_his_(771,8)i(913,9)not mortified _mine_.”

“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, “is a very common failing, (596,9). By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced(1812,9)(281,8)common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and tha(1618,9)re very few of us
who(1265,8)cherish a feeling of self-complacency (280,8)core of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be
proud(2011,9)being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves; vanity to what w(1486,13)others think of us.”

“I(1116,9)as rich as(1945,10),” cried(913,9)Lucas, who cam(1101,9)s
sisters, “I sh(1912,9)care how proud I was. (1263,8)keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”

“Then you woul(52,10)great deal more than you ought(1492,9)rs.
Bennet; “and (1387,10)to see you at it, (217,9)take away your bottle
directly.”

The boy protest(806,8)she(285,11); she continued to declare(46,9)
would; and the argument ended only with the visit.

(19,19)

CHAPTER VI.(33,19)The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. T(141,8)
was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the
good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley(295,8)(909,9)mother was
found to be intolerable(1136,8)e younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was(1634,8)ed towards the
two eldest. By Jane this attention was receiv(86,8)the greatest
pleasure; but(1663,10) still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
everybody, hardly excepting even h(279,9), and c(990,9)like them;
(1284,10)ir kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,
in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It
was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and
to _her_ it was equ(82,12) that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him(239,10)first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but(1108,8)sider(655,8)(556,8)(1964,8)
was(449,9)l(81,8)discovered by(1742,8)ld in(329,8), since Jane
uni(752,9)great strength of(1937,8), a composure of temper and an
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her(528,9)
suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss
Lucas.

“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection(1548,10)same skill
(830,9)object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe(576,11)(818,8)in the
dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachmen(953,8)it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight(941,11) is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be re(255,8)love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten,(500,9)had(1648,8)show _more_
(510,10)than she feels.(1816,8) likes you(1759,8) undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”

“But(33,10)(29,11), as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can
perceive her regard(1307,8), he must be a simpleton indeed not to
(1225,8) it too.”

“Remember, Eliza(1526,10)(207,9)know Jane’s disposition as you do(229,9)i(904,10)is partial to a man, and(294,10)endeavor to(950,8)
it(202,10)find it out.”

“Perhaps(234,8), if he sees(599,8)of her. But though(491,9)and Jane
meet tolerably often,(813,8)ever for many hours toget(1782,8) as they
always see each other in large mixed parties(95,8)impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing(136,9). Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in (1899,10)can command his
attention. When she is secure of him, the(672,8)be leisure for falling
(973,8)(730,11)she chooses.”

“Your plan is a good one(1609,11)Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
question(1147,8) desire of being well married; and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any(16,10)I dare say I(424,8)adopt it. But
these are not(812,8)feelings;(333,8)not acting by design. As yet she
cannot even be certain(1987,8)degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since din(722,8)mpany(94,10)four times. This(1718,8)quite
(1585,10)make her understand his character.”

“Not(1177,8)represent it. Had she merely _dined_(229,9), she might
only have (1329,8)ed whether he had(696,8)appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent(1125,9)--and four
(49,9)may do a great deal.”

“Yes: these(98,20)enabled them to as(591,8)that they both
like Vingt-un(1864,8)than Commerce, but with respect to any other
leading(394,10)istic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”

“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart(1000,8)
she were(1025,8) to him to-morrow,(967,10)think s(469,8)s good a
chance of happiness as(2026,8)were to be studying(651,14) for a
twelvemonth. H(73,9)in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the(1912,12)s(1040,8)parties are ever so well known to(1690,11), or
(37,8)similar beforehand, it(2033,10)advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
hav(97,8)share of vexation; and it is(656,9)o know as little as
(1870,9)(1313,9)fect(288,10)erson with whom you are to pass your
life(1687,8) make me laugh,(644,10); but it(1478,8)sound. You know(26,10)
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s (1960,9) to her sister,(1844,10)
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty:(1352,8)looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he(73,15)only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself (1630,8)friends(317,10)had
hardly(1540,8)feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression(2047,8)dark eyes. To
this(1709,9)y succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
(265,8)orm, he was forced to acknowledge her figu(1359,9)light and
pleasing; and in spite(640,8)asser(726,10)her manners were not those
of the fashionable world(154,9)caugh(372,8)ir easy playfulness. Of
this(828,9)perfectly unaware:(909,8)he was only the man who made
(603,9)greeable nowhere, and who had(187,8)ught her handsome enough
to dance with.

H(613,11)wish(1324,9)more of her; and, as a step towards conversing
with her(771,8), attended(1131,8)conversati(1367,8)others. His doing so
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were
assembled.

“What does(1140,11)mean,” said she to(1459,10), “by listening to my
(195,18)Colonel Forster?”

“That is a question which(1263,11)only can answer.”

“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about. He has a very satir(918,8), and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself(140,10)soon grow afraid of him.”

[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George
Allen._]]

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though(1546,9)seeming to have
any in(1796,8)of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking(1885,10) to do it, she
turned to him and said,--

“Did not you think,(1838,10),(497,8)expressed myself (1554,11)well
just now, when I was teasing(700,16) to give us a ball at
Meryton?”

“With great energy; but it is (275,10)which always makes a lady
energetic.”

“You are severe on us.”

“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased(956,8)(442,10). “I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows(157,13)(823,8)trange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a
musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down(150,8)those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers.” On(844,11)’s persevering, however,
she added, “Very well; if it(126,9)so,(15,8).” And gravely glancing
at(792,12)“There i(1263,9)fine old saying(936,8)(371,9) here is
of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and
(1450,8)keep mine to swell my song.”

Her(309,8)ance was pleasing(1221,9)by no means capital. After a song
or two, and(601,8)she could reply to t(1406,24) that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at(850,15) by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of be(581,8)only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.

Mary had neither genius nor taste; and(1608,8)(906,11)given her
application, it(30,14) likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner(1591,8)(972,11)injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.(1640,10), easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure(1867,9)not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs(99,8) request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined(751,9)in
dancing at one end(80,8)room.

(1936,9) stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
pass(1358,8)evening,(946,9)xclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till(42,13)thus began:--

“What a charming amusem(886,8)young people this is,(1455,10)! (1454,8)
nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as on(479,9)first
refinements of polished societies.”

“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also(1194,10)in vogue amongst
the less(104,19)(630,8)world: every savage can dance.”

(387,12)only smiled. “Your friend(1884,8)s delightfully,” he
continued(299,9) pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
not that you are an adept(2048,8)science yourself(454,11).”

“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”

“Yes, indeed, and received no in(492,8)abl(1170,10) from the sight. Do
you often(119,10)St. James’s?”

“Never(122,10)Do you not think it would be a proper compliment(1857,8)place?”

“It is a(36,12)which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it(308,9)have a house in town, I conclude?”(1127,12)bowed.

“I had once some(999,10)of fixing(77,8) myself, for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas.”

He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and(1771,10) at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,--

“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you(1231,8)?(1273,10), you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as(160,8)desirable partner. You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”
And, taking her hand, he would have given it to(215,12)who, though
extremely surprised,(473,9)unwilling to(1020,8) it(161,8)he(463,8)ly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to(1752,12),--

“Indeed, sir, I have not the least inten(521,9)ancing. I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a(420,9)(971,12), with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
(406,10)but in vain.(788,11)was determined; nor did(2037,13)at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

“You excel(585,9)in the(623,8)(780,12)that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of(1714,8)you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can(491,8) objection(779,13)to oblige us
for one half hour.”

“(1402,10)is all politeness,” sai(1160,11), smiling.

“He i(1761,9): but (1747,8)ing the inducement, m(1094,20)e(976,8)wonder a(1317,10)laisance; for who would object to such a
partner?”

(1329,10)looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured
her(1345,10)(407,9), and he was thinking of (47,9)some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--

“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”

“I should imagine no(1902,10)are(392,13)how insupportable it would be to pass many
evenings in this manner,--in such(1863,10)and(507,8), I am quite of
your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the
noise--the nothingness(36,13) self-importance, of all these
people! Wha(239,8)I give to hear your strictures on them!”

“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged.(1431,8)been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes(1165,8)face of a pretty woman can bestow.”

(620,12) immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.(1563,10) replied(1571,9)eat intrepidity,--

“(1381,10)beth Bennet.”(26,24)!” repeated(865,13). “I am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you
joy?”

“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you(1030,10)wishing me joy.”

“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall(1528,9) the matter as
absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law(1116,10)and
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”

He listened to(1444,10)perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself(1304,15); and as(1715,9)osure convinced her
that all was safe,(1582,8) flowed along.

     “A note for Miss Bennet”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]




CHAPTER VII.(103,16)]

Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four (298,9)pounds.

She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who(120,11) clerk to their
father and succeeded him(1584,8)busi(1865,10)a brother(926,8) in
London in a respectable line of trade.

The village of Longbourn was only one mile from(277,8); a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three o(351,8)imes a week, to pay their duty(301,9) aunt, and
to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:
their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing
better offered, a walk to(667,8) was necessary to amuse(841,9)rning
hours and furnish conversation(430,9)evening; and, however bare of
news the country in general might be, they(1489,8)contrived to learn
some from(443,11). At present(1583,10)they were we(972,8)ied both
with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in
the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and(383,12)
the head-quarters.

Their visits to Mrs(1020,9) were now productive(641,8)most interesting
intelligence. Every day added something(781,10)knowledg(83,8)
officers’ names and connections. Their lodging(158,9)t long a secret,
and at length they began to know the (109,8) themselves.(1272,12)
visited them all, and this op(2018,9)is nieces a source of felicity
unknown before. They could talk of(834,8) but(149,9); and Mr.
Bingley’s large (1641,11)e mention of which gave animation(1445,10)mother, was worthless i(984,8)eyes when opposed to the(643,9)als of
an ensign.

After listening one(966,8)(1264,10)effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed,--

“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girl(250,8)(1056,8). I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced.”
(1407,11)was disconcerted, and made no answer; but(1445,9)ith perfect
indifference, continued to express her admira(500,8)Captain Car(1007,8)
her hope of seeing(1933,12)cours(963,9)day, as he was going the
next(461,12)London.

“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. If I wish(656,8)ink slightingly
of anybody’s(62,9), it(112,8)not be of my own(1579,9).”

“If my(118,10)are silly, I must hope to be(1576,8)sensible of it.”

“Yes; but as it happens(1631,8)re all of them very cl(131,9)This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as(429,10)our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.”

“My dear Mr(537,10)(933,9)not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
not think abo(1395,11) any more than we do. I remember the time when I
liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want on(753,8)girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in
his(1595,12).”

“Mamma,” cried(1284,8)“my aunt says that (133,16)and(1257,8)
Carter(768,8)go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did w(546,9)first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”

(1256,11) was prevented replying by the entranc(1397,9)footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.(1415,12)’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her(1004,9) read,--

“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us;(24,11), my love.”

“It is from Miss Bingley(1675,8)Jane(304,9)n read it aloud.

     /* NIND (1190,9)friend, */

     “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never
     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this. My bro(1433,9)the gentlemen are(289,9)with the(1397,9).
     Yours ever,

“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”

“W(59,16)!(1099,13): “I wonder (1108,8)did not(585,8) of
_that_.”

“Din(739,8)” said(821,12); “that is very unlucky.”

“Can I(1697,10)carriage?(631,11).

“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain;(711,10)(1851,9)stay all night.”

“That would be a good scheme(789,8)Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home.”

“Oh, but(496,15)will have Mr.(916,8)’s chaise to go to Meryton;
(1234,8)Hursts have no horses to theirs.”

“I had much rather go in the coach.”

“But(380,14)r father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted(95,8)farm, Mr(1527,8),(1043,9)they?”

[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]

“(96,8) (96,18) much oftener than I can get them(223,8) if you have got them to-da(1280,9)(491,12)my mother’s purpose
will be answered.”

She did at last extort from he(327,9)an acknowledgment that(337,11)
were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to(782,18)and her
mother attended her to the door with many c(364,19) of a bad
day. Her hopes wer(246,10); Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening(1437,9)intermission;
Jane certainly c(936,9)come back.

“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!(1271,18), more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for(1306,10):--

     /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */

     “I find myself(1583,8)well this (255,9)which, I suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on
     my seeing Mr. Jones--(961,10)do not be alarmed(1172,8)should hear
     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a
     headache, there is not much the matte(1040,8)e.

“Yours, etc.”

“Well(1935,10)(2032,9)(1484,10)when(1821,10) had read the note
aloud(1845,9)r daughter(239,9)ave a dangerous fit of illness--if she
should die--i(1966,13)comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of

trifling colds. She (1598,8)taken good care of. As long as she stays
there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I c(351,10)the
carriage.”

(1762,11)feeling really anxious, determin(1642,9)to her, though(83,13)(1172,9)to be had: and(199,8)was no horsewoman, walking was
her only alternative. She declared her resolution.

“How can you be so silly,” cried(1604,11), “as to think of such a
thing, in a(1139,8)dirt! You will(935,8)fi(218,8)seen when you get
there.”

“I shall be very(54,8)see Jane--which(452,8)I want.”

“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy(881,8)her father, “to send for the
horses?”

“No(1700,8). I(1129,8)wish to avoid the walk. The distanc(1049,8)hing,
when one has a motive; only three miles. (243,11)back by dinner.”

“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
impulse of(683,9)sh(1020,8)guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion(1377,8)always be in proportion to what is required.”

“We will go as far as Meryton with you(1308,8)Catherine and Lydia.(880,10) accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.

“If we make haste(1434,8)Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”

In(249,9)they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers’ wives, and(1614,11)continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles, with impatient(699,9), and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.

She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she(1998,13)walked(1068,12) so early in the day in such
dirty weather, and by(353,8), was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss(2010,8);(585,15)was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. (356,8)received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother’s manners there was(887,11)better than politeness--(44,9)
good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst
nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which(652,9) had given to her complexion and doubt as to
the occasion’s justifying(57,8)ing so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his(758,10).

Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill(1446,8)ough up, was very feverish, and not well
enough to leave her room.(666,15)glad to be tak(330,9)
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance(834,10)not equal,
(835,9)to much conversation;(1163,8)n (974,12) left them (1797,8),
could attempt little beside(212,9)ons of gratitude for the

When(1404,11)was over, they were joine(417,9)sisters(1191,15)

wanted a(934,8)(1137,9)to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
at parting with her that(1069,14)was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield(1087,9)present(1480,12)most thankfully consent(683,8)a servant was
despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family(238,10)stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.

(44,19)covering a screen(42,8)CHAPTER VIII.(58,16)]

At five o’clock the two(748,8)retired to dress, and at half-past six
(1823,14)summoned to dinner. To the civil(2032,11)which then
poured in, and amongst which(1201,9)the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior (1378,11)of Mr.(1700,8), she could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. T(1570,10), on hearing
this, repeated three or four times(1975,10)(1658,10)grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad(1455,11)how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter:(40,8)ir
indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored(558,11)to the enjoyment of all her original(198,8).

Their brother, indeed, was the only on(192,9)party whom(492,10)
regard with any complacency. His anxiety(1925,9) was evident, and his
attentions to(2037,8) most pleasing(353,9)y prevented her feeling
(54,8)so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. She had very(1465,8)notice from any but him(1558,15)was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom(1904,11)sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had (1924,11)say to her(1922,8)dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and(1887,13)
began abusing her as soon(463,8)was out(865,8)room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad(754,8)--a mixture of pride and impertinence:
(1333,8)n(1877,8)sation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst
(1050,8)the same, and added,--

“She has(345,8), in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
looked almost wild.”

“She di(314,9) Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because(853,12)had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”

“Yes, a(753,8)etticoat; I hope you saw(30,14), six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certa(1920,8)the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.”

“Your picture may(717,9)exact(398,8),” said(1946,8); “but this was
all lost upon me. I(1714,9)Miss(1129,11)Bennet looked remarkably well
when she came into(902,9)(600,15)Her dirty(357,10) quite
escaped my not(232,8)_You_ observed it,(1348,12)I am sure(233,8)(1406,12); “and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _you(1440,8)_ make such
an exhibition.”

“Certainly not.”

“To walk three miles, or four(15,12)iv(30,12)whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum.”

“It shows an affection for(1788,12)that is very(2017,9),” said
Bingley.

“I am afraid(515,12)”(540,10)(1914,12), in a half whisper,
“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes.”

“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
short pause followed this speech, and(1589,11) began again,--

“I have(1525,8)ssive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet
girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections(1321,8)fraid there is no
chance of it.”

“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton?”

“Yes;(1418,8)y(321,8)other, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”

“That is capital,” added(1664,11)(98,11)both laughed heartily.

“If(131,8)d uncles enough to fill _all_(124,10),” crie(1489,9), “it
(1218,10)make them one jot less agreeable.”

“But it must very materially lessen their (389,10)marrying men of any
consideration in the world,”(781,8) Darcy.

To(728,12)(1680,8) made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend’s vulgar relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlou(790,8)at with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and(1958,11)(1740,10)quit her(1187,8) till
late(427,8)evening, (1981,9)had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appea(247,12)ather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself. On enter(310,9)rawing-room, she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high, she declined it, and mak(281,8)(1737,9)e
excuse, said she would amuse(227,8), for the short time she(1978,8)tay
below, with a book. Mr(1542,8)looked at her with astonishment.

“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “(1921,8)rather singular.”

“Miss Eliza(1606,8)” sai(1900,16)“despises cards. She is a great
read(1544,8)has no pleasure in anything else.”

“I deserve neither such praise nor such censur(1302,10)(777,9); “I
am _not_(135,8) (135,12)I have(135,13)many things.”

“In nursing you(488,9)I am sure you(70,14)(286,8)Bingley; “and
I hope it will soon be increased by(872,12)quite well.”

(988,10)thanked him from her heart,(1741,8)n walked towards a table
where a few books were lying. He(814,13)offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.

“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow(1978,8)ough(454,8)not many,(471,8)more
than I ever(819,8)into(342,14)assured him(1187,10)could suit(1176,8) perfectly with those
in the room.

“I am(906,9)ed(812,23)that my father(1295,8)have left
so small a(318,12)of books. What a delightful(391,9)(656,9)at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”

“It ought to be good,” he(1971,8): “it has bee(2005,9)k of many
generations.”

“A(635,8)(126,10)dded so much to it yourself--you are always buying
books.”

“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family(640,9)in such days as
these.”

“Neglect!(950,15)(77,8)nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, w(252,8)build _your_ house,(777,8)it may be
half as(446,12)as (429,9).”

“(53,13).”

“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take(116,10) for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire.”

“With all my heart: I will buy(120,11)itself, if Darcy will sell it.”(849,8)talking of possibilities,(388,8).”

“Upon my word, Caroline, I(865,8)think it more possible to ge(815,11) by(324,10)than by imitation(1426,14)was(743,9)caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed(1217,9)between Mr.(1977,8) and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.

“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?(1273,19): “will
she be as tall as I am?”

“I think she will. She is now about Miss(2022,10) Bennet’s height, or
rather taller.”

“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who(1380,8)ed me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished
(494,8)age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”

“It is amazing to me(1643,8)(1638,10)how young ladies can have patience
to be so ver(163,14) as they all are.”

“All(82,14)(213,12)! My dear(1305,12)at do you mean?”

“Yes, all of them, I think. T(113,8)paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. I scarcely know any one who(1609,8)do all this; and I am
sure(510,9)heard a(306,10)y spoken of for the first time, without
being informed that she was(343,18).”

“Your list of the common extent of(557,11)ments(476,8)Darcy, “has
to(1886,8)ruth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwi(1258,11)netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of(658,8)in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my
acquaintance that are(1846,9)(398,16)Nor I, I am sur(841,9)(1211,12).

“Then,”(1303,8)d(1156,10), “you must comprehend a great deal(262,8)
idea of an(878,14)woman.”

“Yes; I do(76,28)it.”

“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can b(272,8)
esteemed(144,15)ho does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, t(710,9) the word; and, besides all
this, she must possess a(306,8) something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or(159,9)
will be but half(903,8)d(1368,9)this(174,17),” added Darcy; “and to all(218,10)yet add
(208,10)more substantial(811,8)improvement(201,8)mind by extensive
reading.”

“I am no longer surprised at your(931,9)_only_ six(728,17)en.
I rather wonder now(67,18)any_.”

“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of(513,9)?”

“_I_ never saw such(1298,8). (28,19)capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”

Mrs. Hurst an(1111,14) both cried out against the injustic(627,8)
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr(173,8)called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end,(1384,10) soon afterwards left the
room.

“Eliza Bennet(1479,20), when the door was closed on her, “is
one of those young(1712,8)who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it
succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”

“Undoubtedly,” repli(1108,8), to whom this remark was chiefly(1248,8)ed,
“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which(2017,8)sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.”

(850,13)was not so entirely satisfied with(233,8)ply as to
continue the subject.

that she could not leave her.(1034,9)urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for

CHAPTER IX.(113,16)](968,12)passed the chief(724,8)night in(966,11)’s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquirie(1325,8)she very early received from M(1062,11)by a housemaid,
and some time(1819,12)from the two elegant(1733,12)waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment, (664,9)she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation. The note was (1302,11) despatched, and
its contents as quickly compl(1550,8). Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
(666,18), reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger,(149,12) would have been
very(1106,10); but(1581,8)(1769,9)on see(373,8)(1698,9)illness was
not alarming, she had no wish(376,8)recovering(363,12), as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from(309,12). She
(1585,10)listen, therefore, to her daught(1553,13)(887,10)carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the(788,8)and three(237,9)s all
attended her into the(601,10) parlou(1707,11)met them with hopes(1833,8)(598,10)had not found(1805,12) worse than she expected.

“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be
moved.(1977,12)ays we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
(389,9)longer on your kindness.”

“Removed!” cried(2002,8). “It(113,10)be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear(804,10)moval.”

“You may depend upon it, madam,” sai(365,8)ingley, with cold civility,
“that(405,13)shall(1562,8) every (1952,19)while she
remains with us.”

(1109,13)as profuse(1785,8)acknowledgments.

“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not
know wha(1227,8)become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with(135,14)has, without excep(938,10)sweetest
temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_. You have a sweet room here,(2048,12), and a charming prospect
ov(1511,8)gravel walk.(387,9) know a pla(282,10)country that is
equal to(1441,14)You(759,10)(918,9)quitting it in a hurry, I
hope(415,9)y(216,8)but a short lease.”

“Whatever I do is done(80,12)” replied he; “and(1563,10) if I
should resolve to quit(1945,12), I sh(1683,14)be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”

“That is exactly what(126,10)have supposed of you(1043,8)Elizabeth.

“You begin to comprehend me, do you?(1228,8)he, turning towards her.

“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”

“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through, I am afraid, is pitiful(285,13)as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimabl(1730,8)uch a one as yours.”

“Lizzy,(327,10)r mother, “remember where you are, and(847,8)run on in
the wild mann(900,8)you are suffered to do at home.”

“I did(923,10)before,” continu(1703,10), immediately, “(97,9)were
a studier of(277,10). (1754,8)be an amusing study.”

“Yes; but (339,19)s are the _most_(63,8). They have at
least that advantag(774,8)(1116,9)(1778,8)Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study. In a(1201,9)neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.”

“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever(358,8),(1739,8)(946,8)(1925,11), offended by his(581,8)of mentioning a
(249,21). “I assure you(168,10)quite as much of _that_
going on(1536,16)as in town.”

Everybody was surprised; an(456,9)after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.(253,14)who fancied she had gained(1144,8)ete
victory over him,(803,11)her triumph,--

“I cannot see that London has any gre(688,12) over(1805,12), for
my part, except the shops and public places. (751,11) is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it(2002,13)?”

“When I am(1946,15),” he(1794,8), “I never wish to leave it; and
w(70,13)own, it is pretty much the same(972,12)each their
(969,9)s, and I can be equally happy in either.”

“Ay, that is because(2041,10)the right disposition. But that
gentleman,”(593,12)(1073,8)seemed to think(696,13)was nothing
at all.”

“Indeed, mamma,(1420,9)mistaken(1906,17), blushing for her
mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant(1068,12)was not(1219,8)variety of(1138,9)o be met with(912,26), which
you must acknowledg(69,8)true.”

“Certainly, my dear, nobody said(155,8)ere; but as to not meeting with
many(1305,8)in this(1392,14), I believe there are few
(1431,13)s larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”

Nothing but concern for(433,10) could enable(1831,8) to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicat(2005,8)irected her eye towards
(493,9) with(1630,8)expressive smile.(588,12)for the sake of
saying(1596,11)that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.(1677,8)she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is(1223,13)--is not he?(1855,8) the man of fashion! so
genteel and so easy! He has alway(1898,12)to say to e(1688,8). _That_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons(1647,9)y(2033,12)very
important and never open their mouth(1879,8)mistake the matter.”

“Did (418,10)(745,10)you?”

“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. F(1690,12)(1604,11), _I_(315,8)keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But(384,10) is to
judge(751,8)mselv(1589,8)the Lucases are(823,8)good sort of girls, I
assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think(794,11)so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”

“She seems(998,8)(1980,8) young woma(1596,9)Bingley.

“Oh dear, yes; but (1453,9)ow(120,9)very plain. Lady(964,8)erself
has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not(119,8)ee anybody
better(1933,8)(406,8)wha(516,12)says(136,11)trust my own
partiality. W(381,8)was only fifteen(1835,11)a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner’(1810,9)(1117,9)in love(1212,9), that my
sister-in-law was sure (893,9)make her an offer before we came away.
But, however, he did not. Perhaps he(1456,8) her too young. H(55,10)
wrote some verses on her, and very pret(754,8)were.”

“And so ended his affectio(646,9)(1654,11)impatiently. “There has
been many a one,(1137,8), overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driv(1648,8) love!”

“I have been used to consider(61,8)as the _food_ of love(876,8)Darcy.

“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin(1200,9)inclination, I
am convinced that one(1250,8)nnet will starve it entirely away.”

Darcy only smiled(1715,8)e general pause which ensued made(504,10)
tremble lest her mother should be exposing(1131,8) again. She longed to
speak, but could think of no(1928,12); and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to(1723,12) for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.(89,13)was
unaffectedly civil in his answ(899,8)forced his younger sister to be
civil al(1430,8)say what the occasion required. She performed her part,
indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her(2045,11)put(546,9)forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit(728,10)result of it was, that the
(154,9)should tax(462,14)ith having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a(1111,8)well-grown girl of(1717,8)(662,8) fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourit(1713,10) mother, whose
(1502,9) had br(1624,10)into public at an early age. She had high
animal spirits, and a(1219,9)natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her
own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was
very equal, therefore, to address(1098,13)on the subject of the
ball, and abruptly reminded him of his(596,8); adding, that it would be
the most shameful thing(1855,8)world if he did not keep it. H(1138,9)
to this sudden attack was delightful to(1485,11)’s ear.

“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when
you(1248,9)is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”(892,8)declared(1699,9)(1266,9). “Oh yes--(395,11) much better to
wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter
(95,9)at Meryton(1837,8)And when you have given _your_ ball,” she
added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. (41,8)tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame(616,8)oes not.”

(1590,12)and (1503,14)then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leav(1985,8)own(91,9)relations’ behaviour to the
remark(1089,9)two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
c(589,9)be prevailed on to join i(341,8)censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss(1612,8)’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.




[Illustration]




CHAPTER X.(32,19)The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
(1769,8)had spent some hour(1419,9)morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and,(1201,8)evening,(521,11)joined
their party(1246,8)drawing-room. The loo table(435,10)(1272,9)appear.
(491,9) was writing,(244,9)(2013,8), seated near him, was watching
the progress(1456,8)letter, and repeatedly calling off his (1743,9) by
messages to his sister. Mr(398,13)(1619,11)were at piquet, and
(445,11)was observing(993,8)ame.

(862,10)took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what(607,8)between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commenda(2005,13)lady either on his hand-(420,9)or(1872,8)evenness
(378,8)ines(33,12)length(409,16)(676,9)perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue(314,9)
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.

“How(1892,8)ed Miss(669,8)ill be to(127,8) such a letter!”

He made no answer.

“You write uncommonly fast.”

“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”

“How many letters you must have occasion to write(965,8)course of a
year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”

“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”

“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”

“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”

“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well.”

“Thank you--but I always mend my own(442,9)can you contrive(423,10)so even?”

He was silent.

“T(288,16)I am(674,11)to hear of her improvement(923,8)harp,
and pray let her know(365,8)am quite in raptures(806,10)beautiful
little design for a(1503,8)and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley’s.”

“Will you give me leave to defer your(150,10)till(803,9)again? At
present I have not room to do them justice.”

“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall(635,8) in January. But do you
always(451,8)uch charming long(933,9)to her, (1768,9)?”

“They are generally long; but whether(590,8)(88,8)(180,8)not for me
to determine.(925,10)a rule with me, that a person who can(325,8)(175,12) with
ease cannot(1098,8)(753,10)t will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her
brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much
for words of four syllables. Do not you,(368,11)My style of writing is very different from(1186,11)Oh(188,9)Miss(2034,8), “Charles writes(1385,8)most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”

“My ideas flow so rapidly(1320,8)(751,9)time to express them; by which
means m(1596,10)sometimes convey no ideas at (1473,10)correspondents(1715,8)r humility, Mr.(281,9)” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”

“Nothing is more deceitful(69,8)Darcy, “than the appearance of
(129,8). It is often only(386,9)ness of(2023,8), and(248,11)an
indirect bo(1937,8)And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modest(994,9) (96,14);(1625,8) are really proud of(1722,8)fects in
writing, (809,8)you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and(278,17)execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is(1828,9)uch prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection(433,8)performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of(1347,15)yourself; and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage(151,12) or anyone else?”

“Nay(1514,9)(1321,10)this i(1468,10), to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said(1383,10)rning. And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
(407,13)merely to show off before the ladies.”

“I daresay you(159,8)d it; but I am by no means convinced that you
w(670,13)with such celerity. Your conduct (47,9)quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were

till next week,’ you would probably do it--(26,19)not

not do justice to his own disposition. (109,9)shown him off now much
more than he did himself.”

“I am exceedingly gratified(1940,8)(915,10)by your converting what my
friend says into a(1176,12)on the sweet(1884,8)my temper. But I am
afraid(1769,9)giving it a turn which that gentleman did(719,12)
intend; for he would certainly think the(548,8)of me if, under such a
circumstance, I(625,9)give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.”

“Would Mr. Darcy then(1942,13) rash(1892,8)your original intention
as atoned for (401,8)obstinacy in adhering to it?”

“Upon my word, I cannot exactly expla(1315,8)atter--Darcy must speak for
(569,12)You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
stand according(1797,8) representation, you must(1605,9), Miss Bennet,
that the(1122,9)ho is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has(1474,8)desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.”

“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of(1351,10)is no merit
with you(83,14)(153,8)conviction is no(992,12)to the understanding of
either(1298,9)appear to me,(779,10), to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard(56,9)requester would often make
one(295,8) yield to a(50,8),(393,9)wait(139,8)(392,8)s to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case(1766,8)have
(607,9)abou(1539,13). We may as well wait, perhaps, till the(1194,13) occurs, before we discuss the discretion(670,8)behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between(1935,8)and friend,
where one of them is(757,9)by the other to change a resolu(155,8)no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire(479,18)to be argued(464,8)?”

“Will it not be advisable(347,12)proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this(683,10)(537,8)as(75,16)ntimacy subsisting
(433,8)the parties?”

“By all means,” crie(2036,9); “let us hear all(63,10)culars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more
weight in th(1276,10)(1446,14) than you may be aware of. I assure
you that if Darcy were not(902,8)great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I(632,8)not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy on(1083,11) occasions, and in
(29,11)places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he has(1390,9)to do.”

(1427,9) smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss(1272,8) warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.

“I see your design,(1412,8),” said his friend. “You dislike an(681,10)
and want to silence this.”

“Perhaps I do. A(1618,9)are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful;(405,8)(846,10)say whatever you like of me.”

“What you ask(281,8)(540,9), “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter(653,14)took her advice, and did(56,19)

When that business was over, he applied to(630,14)an(206,11)
for(632,8)ulgence of some music(691,15)moved with alacrity to
the pianoforte, and after a polite(1485,8) tha(874,12)would lead the
way, which(1854,11)as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.

Mrs. Hurst sang(820,9) sister; and while they were thus employed,
(1051,10)c(1314,9)help observing, as she turned over(328,11)-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently (1188,9)’s eyes were fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose tha(1220,12)be an(1428,8)of
admiration to so great a man, and yet(1265,9)should look at her because
he(1064,8)d her was still more strange. S(1359,9)only imagine, however,
at last,(186,10)drew his notice(115,8) there was something about her
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of righ(1916,8)in
any other person present. The supposition di(1846,8)i(411,11)liked
him too little to care for his approbation.

After playing some Italian songs,(1603,14)varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards(610,10), drawing near(749,10), said to her,--

“Do you not feel a great inclination(163,8)ennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?”

She smiled, but made no answer. He repea(1844,8)question, with some
surprise(683,8)silence.

“Oh(1774,8)she, “I heard you before; but I(1004,11)immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know,(40,8)‘Yes,’
t(1636,8)might have the pleasure of despising my tast(153,9)always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a(724,8)of
their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you
dare.”

“Indeed(80,10)(25,8)(1935,11)having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but(1106,11)a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her(141,12)anybody, and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by h(779,9)ally
believed that, were it not (2020,10)feriority of her connections, he

(1144,13)saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety(146,9)recover(143,9)dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of (1971,9).

She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking(810,10)supposed marriage, and planning his happi(555,8)such an alliance.

“I hope(1163,13)as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of hold(297,8)tongue;
and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after
the officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that(1913,8)something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.”

     “No, no; stay where you are”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”

“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed
in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. They are(705,9)ame profession, you know, only in different
lines. As for your(985,10)’s picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”

“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression(1632,9)ir
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.”

At that moment(1083,11)met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and(1862,10) herself.

“I did not know that you intended to walk(1210,8)(1560,12),(1591,8)
confusion, lest they had been overheard.

“You used us abominably ill,” answered(187,11), “(1075,9)way without
telling us(181,10)were coming out.”

Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left(1614,10)(255,8)
by(310,9) The path just admitted three.(80,10) felt their rudeness,
and immediately said,--

“This walk is not wide(1897,8)for our party. We had better go into the
avenue.”

Bu(201,11), who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly(414,9),--

(1276,27). You are charmingly grouped, and appear to
uncommon(1649,10). The(1003,8)sque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Good-bye.”

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about,(1911,8)hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leav(1871,8)room for a couple of hours that evening.


(1669,24)Piling up the fi(1661,43)


CHAPTER XI.(98,16)]

When the ladies removed after dinne(1443,11) ran up to her sister, and
see(243,8)well guarded from cold, attended her(720,9) drawing-room,
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many(1661,11)s of
pleasure; and(1002,11)had never seen them so agreeable as(1397,10)
dur(1107,8)hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers
of conversation(1220,8)nsiderabl(1875,8)could describe an entertainment
with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh a(1709,8)acquaintance with spirit.

But w(523,8)(211,10)entered,(770,10)no longer(652,8)st object;
(1595,12)’s eyes were instantly turned towards(1431,8)and she had
something to say to him(371,8)he had advanced many steps. He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness
and warmth remained for(305,11)salutation. He was full of joy and
attention. T(384,9)half hour was spent in p(1079,17), lest she
should suffer from the change of room;(410,9)removed, at his desire,
to the other side of(1190,9)place, that she might be farth(119,11)
door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
(1801,11)at work(1515,8)opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.(1300,8)ea was over(527,10) reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards, and(150,11)soon found even his open
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silenc(479,9)whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had, therefore, no(1008,9)do but to stretch (967,8)on on(606,8)
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. (1175,12) did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now(311,8)n in her brother’s(1548,15)ith Miss
Bennet.
(1349,16)(1009,9) was quite as much engaged in watching(570,10)’s progress through _his_ book, as in read(1975,8)own(1009,10)was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking(1055,8)page. She
coul(706,8)n him, however, to any(1822,13); he merely answered her
question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused(455,10)own book, which(1669,8) only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn(1572,9), “How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no
enjoyment like(466,8)! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if(50,8)not
an excellent library.”

No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her(693,8)nd
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing
(918,11) mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him(486,10)--

“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes(1947,8)present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom(300,8)would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.”

“If you mean Darcy,” cried(1323,12), “he may go to bed, if he
chooses(259,9)it begins; but as for the ball, it i(1340,9) settled
thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough(773,9)send
round my cards.”

“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were
carried on in a different manner; but(1031,10)something insufferably
ted(613,8)the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if(1733,14)instead of dancing made the order(1974,8)day.”

“Much (84,13), my dear Caroline, I dare say; but i(157,8)not be
near so much like a ball.”(1861,14) made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about
(1113,8). Her figure was elegant,(1841,11)lked well; but Darcy, at
whom(1599,8)all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the
desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,
turning to Elizabeth,(1199,11)Miss Eliza(1264,9)let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about(1425,9). I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude.”

(190,9) was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. (526,12)
succeeded no les(798,9)real object(361,8)civility: Mr. Darcy looked
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as(211,11)herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book(131,8)
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motive(1370,9)ir choosing to walk(832,8)down(824,9) together, with either of which(87,9)his joining them would
interfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know w(42,10)be his
meaning--and asked(777,10) whether s(252,9)at all understand him.

“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it,(172,8)s to be
severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
nothing about it(1266,16), however, was incapable(93,18)(727,10)in
any(1812,11)persevered, therefore, in requiring an explan(1183,10)is
(559,11).

“I have not the smallest objection to expla(511,10),” said he,(1949,8)
as she allowed him to speak. “You(605,8)choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or(83,17)(958,9) that you(1607,8)s
appear(1074,8)greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be
completely in your way; and(54,8)second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by(107,8)e.”

“Oh, shocking!” cried(1365,13). “I never heard (587,8) so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”

“No(69,8) easy, if you have but the inclination(566,8)(1765,9). “We
can all plague and(123,8)one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate
as(554,8), you must know how it is to be done.”

“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do(1824,12)that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_(179,8)calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,
no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves(406,9)please, by attempting(72,9) without a subject. Mr.
Darcy may hug himself.”

“(1180,11)s not to be laughed at(651,9)(496,12)That is an
uncommon(849,10)(1875,10)mmon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a
laugh.”

“(1452,13)(1258,11)“has given me credit for more than can be. The
wisest and best of men,--nay, the (34,19)their actions,--may
be rendered ridiculous by a person whose fir(1465,9) in life is a
joke.”

“Certainly,” repl(416,13), “there are such people, but(399,8)I am
not one of _them_.(31,10)never(169,8)e what is wise or good. Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I
(1041,9)them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what
(1640,8)without.”

“Perhaps that(746,8)possible for anyone. But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to(349,9).”

“Such as vanity and pride.”

“Yes,(26,8)is a(115,9) indeed. But pride--where there is a real
superiority(1196,8)--pride will be always under good regulation.”

(1522,9) turned away to hide a smile.

“Your examination of (1129,13)over, I presume(1619,8)(1774,12);
“and pray(637,9)the result?”

“I am perfectly convinced by it that(119,11)has no defect. He owns it
himself(1341,9)disguise.”

“No(1777,8)Darcy, “I(1170,8)de no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of (539,13). My(1635,8)I dare not vouch
for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; c(1062,8)(31,12)for the
conveni(1724,8)the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My
feelings(276,8) puffed about with ever(1771,9) to move them(295,11)
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for
ever.”

“_That_ is a failing, indeed(1810,21)Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
really(404,8)_laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”

“There(550,16)in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”

“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody(56,9)yours,” he(1776,8), with(1142,8), “is wilfully to mis(1393,10)
them.”

“Do let us have a(822,8)music,(474,8)(1161,12), tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst.”

Her sister(1114,8)t the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; an(1197,9)after a few moments’ recoll(77,8)was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying(770,10) too much attention.

CHAPTER XII.(34,19)In consequ(1180,8)an agreement betw(1945,9)isters,(136,11)wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the cours(1327,9)day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till(1392,9)owing Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore(549,10)propitious, at
least not to(1295,10)’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word(416,9)y(213,11)possibly have(445,13)
before(306,8); and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr.(1009,8)
and his(911,8)pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well. Against staying(56,9)however(699,13)as positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be ask(1019,8)fearful, on(2026,8)trary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow(315,12)’s(843,10)immediately, and at
length(387,8)settle(487,10)ir original design of leaving(808,12)
tha(988,10)sh(261,8)mentioned(1315,10)request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wish(311,8)(538,9)at least(973,20)day to work on
Jane; an(1017,11)morrow their going was deferred.(1691,13) was
then sorry that(1677,9)proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike
of on(1365,8)(617,8)ceeded her affection for the other.

so(1757,8)repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet tha(776,11)not be
safe(235,8)--(277,9)(1769,8)enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt(1348,12)be right.

To Mr. Darcy(1111,8)welcome intelligence:(1832,11)had been at
(1530,12)long enough. She attracted him more than he li(1004,9)Miss
(526,11) uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He
wisely (1145,8) to be particularly careful that no (933,8)admiration
should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea(356,9)
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and th(34,8)y were at
one time left by(1462,12)for half an hour, he adhered most

On Sunday, after(1413,10)ervice, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place(1240,14)’s civility to(1827,11)increased at last

tenderly, she even shook hands(805,10)former.(1114,11)took leave of

T(1418,9)not(1217,8)d home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered (1998,9)coming(1933,8)ought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father,(829,8)very laconic in his expr(2025,11)(478,8), was really
glad to see them; he had fel(226,8)importance(354,8)family circle. The
evening conversation,(645,11)were all assembled, had lost much of its
animati(1830,8)almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and

CHAPTER XIII(34,19)“I hope, my dear,” said Mr(1019,8)(1789,8)wife, as(1712,14)breakfast the next(1590,8), “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our(910,8)party.”

“Who do you mean(213,9)? I know of nobody that is(1222,9)I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”

“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”

(1478,11)’s eyes sparkled. “A(60,25)! It is Mr.
Bingley(295,11). Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly
thing! Well(372,11) I shall be extremely (1443,12)Mr. Bingley.
But--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got
to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this
moment.”

“It is _not_(167,12)(841,8)her husband; “it is a(461,8)whom I
never saw(1994,8)whole course of my life.”

This roused a general astonishment; and(1743,8)the(1793,9) of being
eagerly questioned by(998,9) and five daughters at once.

After amusing himself some time(1284,12)curiosity, he thus
explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a
fortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,
and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,
when I am dead, may turn you all out(776,8) house as soon as he
pleases.”

“Oh(1417,12)cried(1404,11)“I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.

childre(1318,9)(1382,8) if I(1966,10)you, I(1380,10)ve tried long ago
to do something or other about it.”

Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
They had often(68,11)it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an(407,8)(388,10)a(1825,8)of
(974,14), in favour of a man whom(1822,8)cared anything about.

“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair(1277,8)Mr(1659,8); “and
nothing can clear(850,12) from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to (1076,12)you may, perhaps, be a little
softe(1273,11)manner of expres(1246,12).”

“No, that(1719,19)not: and I(851,10)was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?”

“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as(415,10)hear.”

     /* RIGHT “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_. */

“WILLIAM COLLINS.”

“At(454,15)therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”
said Mr(1971,8), as he folded up the letter. “He seem(1876,8)a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will
prove a(1785,10)acquaintance, especially if(1941,16)should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.”

“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if
he is disposed(1104,8) them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him.”

“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess(184,9)way he can mean
(143,8)us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit.”

Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
(1003,9), and his kind inten(1264,8)christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.

“He must be an oddity, I think(349,8)she. “(1740,9)make him out. There
is something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by
(1714,8)ing for(1997,25)? We(1876,8)suppose he would
help it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”

“No, my dear;(252,8) not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. (840,9)a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter which promises well. I am impatient to se(799,10)In point of composition(800,8)Mary, “his letter does not seem
defective. The idea(1520,8)olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed.”

To(1747,11)and Lydia neither(1380,11) nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins’(429,9)had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing(551,11) with a degree(552,10)ure which
astonished her husband(1962,14).

(162,11) was punctual to his time, and was (294,9)with great
politeness by the whole family.(1928,11) indeed said little; but the
ladies(1237,8)ady enough to talk, and(337,12) seemed(624,9)in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,
heavy-looking(2034,10) of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
stately(1536,10)manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs(341,9)on having so fine a family of
(492,9), said he had heard(636,9)their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short(1117,8)truth; and added, that he did not
doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarrell(732,8)no(370,11)s, answered most readily,--

“You a(469,8)kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly.”(153,8)llude,(1516,8),(291,8)entail of this estate.”

“Ah(192,9)do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,
I know, are all ch(1890,8)this world(1957,11)no knowing how estates

“I am very sensible, madam,(1863,8)hardship to my fa(1681,9)s, and
could s(1504,9)n the subject(867,10) I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies(365,8)come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but(567,10)
when we are better acquainted----”

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of(1887,15)admiration. The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examine(373,8)aised;
(1475,8)commendation of everything would have touch(1444,14)’s
heart, but for the mortifying supposi(89,8)his viewing it all as his
own future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admir(210,9)e begged to know to which(1330,8)(727,12) the excellence of its
cookery was owing. But here he was set right by(1721,12), who assured
him, with some asperity, that t(523,9)very well able to keep a good

herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a
quarter of an hour.

CHAPTER XIV(33,19)During(552,9)Mr(669,8) scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest(425,8)erefore started a(1320,8) in which he expected him to
shine, by observing(501,8) seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and considerati(549,8)is
comfort, appear(129,8)remarkable.(374,12)could not have chosen
better.(1242,12) was eloquent in her praise. T(1622,10) elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of ma(1417,10)with a most important aspect
he proteste(854,9) had never(341,8)life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability(345,8)descension, as(109,8)himself
experienced from Lady (451,9). She had been graciously (956,8)to
approve of both the discourses(626,10)had already had the honour of
preaching before her(127,10)also ask(688,8)wice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of

people, he knew, but _he_(494,11)seen anything but(449,12)in her.
(260,10)ways spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she

neighbourhood, nor(975,8)leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two to visit his relations(626,10)even(705,10)ded to advise(1204,8)marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit(1246,8)humble parsonage, where she had perfectly(775,8)d all the alteration(887,9)been making,(128,8) even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves(1901,8)closets upstairs.

“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs(1730,8), “and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”

“The garden(1732,10)stands my(420,8)abode is separated only by a lane
from(1067,8) Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”

“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”

“She has one only daughter, the heiress of(1214,9) and of very
extensive property.”

“Ah,” crie(435,15)shaking her head, “then(443,8)better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome(225,9)is(1770,8)charming(62,11), indeed(1335,17)herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
(153,8)st of her sex; because there is tha(2037,9)featur(1699,9)marks
the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution,(1798,8)as prevented her making that progress in many

informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. But(1048,8)(1285,9) amiable(714,8)t(1475,13)s

“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among(249,8)ies at
court.”

“Her indifferent state of health unhappily(440,8)s her be(1829,8)own;
and by that means, as I told(764,16)myself one day, has deprived
the British Court of its brightest ornament. H(1212,11) seemed pleased

offer those(411,8)delicate compli(667,12)are always acceptable to

elevated rank, instead of giv(1339,8)consequence, would be adorned by
her. These are the kind of(699,8)thing(1109,8)please(1639,13), and
it is a(1396,9)attentio(1759,8)I conceiv(562,9)peculiarly bound to
pay.”

“You judge(2032,12)ly(2013,10)(2012,8); “and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing(220,10)s proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or(351,9)result of previous study?”

“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time(540,8)ough I
sometimes amus(928,9)with suggesting and arranging such(1195,8)elegant
(783,12)as may be adapted to ordina(865,11)s, I(816,8)wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.”

(472,10)’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped; and he listened to him(1535,9) keenest enjoyment,
maintain(366,11)same time(901,9) resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an(1169,9)al glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.

By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, an(826,12) was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room agai(1866,9)en tea was over,
glad to invite him

to read aloud to(1792,11). Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book
was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be
from a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,
p(261,8)(1549,8)(261,18). Kitty stared at him, and Lydia
exclaimed. Other books were(227,9), and after some deliberation he
chose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted(920,9),--

“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away
Richard? and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”

Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--

“I have often observed how(1592,8)young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp,(1723,8)written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
(1686,8)instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”

Then,(630,9)to(1380,11), he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.(1444,12)accepted the challenge, observing(1091,9)acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.
(127,8)nd her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s(974,10)ion, and promis(1265,8)it should not occur(1628,8)if he would
resum(656,10)(709,9)(1516,8), after assuring them(1363,9)bore his

CHAPTER XV.(33,19)(1777,12)was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but(959,8)assi(940,8)education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and(1044,8)he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retiremen(1647,8)he consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the(165,8)of Hunsford was vacant(514,8)e respect(375,8)e
felt for her high rank, and his veneration(38,9)as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of(1454,8), of his authority as a
clergy(874,9)his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and(571,9).

Having(558,11) house and(210,8)sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose(957,12)(1616,9)(1522,8)found(1937,9)handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This w(505,8)lan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.

H(207,8)did not vary on see(1793,8). Miss Bennet’s lovely face
confirmed his view(146,8)stablished all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_(400,9)settled
choi(1381,8)next morning, howeve(831,8)an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_(1931,8)s(1932,8) before breakfast, a
conversation beginn(1052,9)his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal(1077,8)hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
(865,9), produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encourag(1532,8) caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to
her _younger_(948,12)she could not take upon her to say--(36,9)
not positively answer--but she(716,9)_know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest(139,10) she must just mention--she felt it incumbent (161,9)
hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”

Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and(2002,8)soon
done--done while(663,13)was stirring(832,8)e.(79,10), equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

two(1473,10) married(1972,10)man whom(550,15)bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.

Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and (506,12)was to attend them,
at the request of Mr(1130,8), who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither(147,13)had followed
him after(1244,13)nd there he would continue, nominally(749,8) with
(1957,11)largest folios in the collection, but really t(391,11)r.
(262,9)ith little cessation,(1311,10)use and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed(358,11) exceedingly. In(324,13)he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquill(1733,9)though prepared, as he told
(915,11)to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,
(607,9)prompt in inviting(701,13)to join his(953,11)in their
walk(754,17), being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.

In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered(1079,8). The at(1116,10)
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes
were immediately wandering(1405,8)street in (1099,9)the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a(925,8)new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.

But t(270,15) every lady(1751,9) caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen(1517,9)of most gentlemanlike appearance,(1496,8)
with an(269,8) on the other sid(1199,9)way. T(311,10)(429,8) very
Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and
he bowed as they passed. All were struck with(478,8)anger’s air, all
wondered who (1832,9)be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible
to find out, led(264,8) across(604,11), under pretence of wanting
something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just(756,8)the
pavement, when the two(478,8)en, turning back, had reached the same
spot. (425,10)addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day
befor(1418,8)own, and(1457,9)happy to say, had accepted a com(142,8)in
their corps. This was exactly as it sh(508,9)for (1140,9) man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming. His(847,11) was
greatly in his favour:(1832,8)all the best parts of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing(449,8). The (409,8)tion
was followed up(1502,12) by a happy readiness of conversation--a
(29,10)at(581,9) time perfectly correct and unassuming(2024,8)e
whole party(957,8)ill standing and talking together very agreeably,
(756,9)sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down(1563,11). On distinguishing the ladies(1584,8)group
(893,17) came(831,9) towards them, and began the usual
civilities.(162,10)as the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
(41,10)object. He(1856,9), he said,(2009,8)way to Longbourn on
purpos(1411,12) after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and

was all astonishment(774,8)effec(137,9)meeting. Both changed colour,
one(98,8)white,(1883,11)red.(1336,14)after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which(426,11)just deigned to return.
What(1796,9) the meaning of it? It was im(1788,8) to imagine; it was
(30,11)not to long to know.

In another minute Mr(739,9), but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on(1616,8)(1663,8).

pressing(1861,8)ies that they would come in, and even(79,14)rs.
(139,10)throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.

Mrs(224,9) was always glad(816,8)her nieces(1476,9) two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly

(1942,9)best politeness, which he return(875,8)as much more,
apologizing for his intrusion,(1044,9)any previous acquaintance(133,9)(112,11)could not help flattering himself, however, might be

breeding; but her contempla(400,8)on(1769,10) was soon put an end to

disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine(1836,10)Philipses the

tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering(364,9)y parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
(1507,8)repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,
with unwearying(1626,9),(1747,16)perfectly needless.

As they(888,8)home, Elizabeth related to Jane what (1915,8)seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane(442,12)defended either or
both, had they (986,8) to be wrong, s(1615,11) more explain such
behaviour than her sister.

(1882,12)on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.
Philips’s manners and(1897,11). He (697,14),(1075,8)Lady

(396,8)not only received him(1140,10)utmost(540,11)but had even
pointedly included him in her(1006,12)for the next(966,8), although
utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed(2031,11)attributed to his connecti(1344,11)m, but yet(297,14)met with so
much attent(1696,11)whole course of his life.

that(2029,12) had accepte(1750,8)uncle’s(1687,11)(1319,10)then in
the house.

When this informa(446,9)given(1477,11)had all taken their seats,(1473,13)was at leisure to look aroun(328,10)admire, and he was so much
struck(1994,10)size and furnitur(2043,8) apartment, that he declared he
might almost hav(871,10) himself(1924,8)small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when(2005,13) understood from him wh(118,10)
was, and who was its proprietor, when(1675,9)listened to the
description of only one of Lady (1407,9)’s(625,13)s, and found

the forc(454,9)complime(1019,8)(1813,8)rdly have resented(381,13)
(1488,9)housekeeper’s room.

In describing(1405,8)all the grandeur(259,18)(1666,9)mansion,
with occasional digressions in prai(1346,10)own humble abode(831,9)
improvements it was receiv(1540,8)was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them;(833,8)found i(601,15)a very(1533,8)ve

soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
(788,8)had nothing to do but to wish for an instru(617,10)examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
The (487,10)did approach: and(1082,8)(1536,10)walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that(1052,9)neither been seeing him before, nor thinking

skill(1832,8)speaker.

With such rivals for the noti(1881,10)fair as(1074,13)(1679,8)(916,8), Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance;(741,8)young
ladies he certainly was(1420,8); but he had still at (1325,8)s a kind(1686,9)(1728,16), and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly
suppli(1714,8)coffee and muffin.

When the card tables were placed,(173,8)an opportunity of obliging her,
in return, by sitting down to whist.

“I know littl(1184,9)game at(1192,8),” said he, “but I shall be glad to
improve myself; for in my situation of life----”(327,13) was very
thankful for his compliance, but(1906,11)wait(39,9)reason.(1067,14)did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between(1085,11)and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia’s engross(1752,8)entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much(978,9)ed in(507,9), too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.
Allowing(1050,9)common demand(1930,9)game,(1056,13)was therefore
at leisure to talk to(1501,10), and(341,9)very willing to hear him,
though what she chiefly wished(44,9)she(641,11)hope to be told,
the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even
mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved.(1365,13)began the subject himself. He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating(1823,8)how long(265,10) had been staying there.

“About a month(1159,8)(1979,9)(1925,9)n, un(473,11)let(237,12)
drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand.”

“Yes,” replied(1723,8); “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten
thousand per annum. You(610,12)ave met with a person more capable of
giving you(1765,8) information (591,8)head than myself--for I have been
connect(1696,8)his family, in a(961,11) manner, from my infancy.”

(1310,10)(1453,10)but look surprised.

“You may well be(29,10), Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold(644,8)of our meeting
yesterday. Are you much(957,9)(1968,8)(955,9)?”

“As much as I ever wish to be,” crie(684,11), warmly. “I have spent
four days(1409,8)same house(389,8)m, and I think him very
disagreeable.”

(89,8)no right to give _my_ opinion(1996,8)Wickham, “as to his being
(84,9) or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one.(585,8)known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial. But I believe your(218,8) of him would in general
astonish--and, perhaps, you w(1486,9)express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”

“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except (1441,11). He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgus(1004,13)pride. You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyon(645,8)cannot pretend to be sorry(637,17)after a short
interruption, “that he or that any man sh(1111,10)e estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_(572,11)it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frighten(46,9)
high and impos(1798,10)s, and sees him only as he chooses(311,8)een.”

“I(247,8)take him, even on _my_ slight(1203,9)ance,(876,8)n
ill-tempered man.”

Wickham only shook his head.

“I wonder(1910,8)he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.”

“I do(714,12)know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was a(804,15)I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affect(512,10)being(1452,8)(925,13).”

“Oh no--it(915,8)(1226,11) be driven away by(1618,10). If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but(1466,8)no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what(1201,9)proclaim to all the world--a sense of
very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at(357,11)what he is.
His father, Miss Bennet, the late(1949,10), was one(473,8)best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend(2001,8)had; and I can never be
in company with this(460,10) without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous(803,8)verily(1822,9)I could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory(913,8)father.”

Elizabeth found the interest(886,8)subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.

Mr.(1653,8) began to speak on more general topics, Meryton,(1926,20)the society, appearing highly pleas(1880,8)all that he
had yet seen, and(1334,9)(1156,8)latter, especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.

“It was the prospect of constant(184,11)nd good(202,9)” he added,
“which was my chief inducement to enter(1337,14). I know it(1659,8)
most respectable, agreeable corps; and my(891,8)Denny tempted me
(462,8)by his accoun(576,8)ir present quart(1883,9)the (1149,10)
attentions and excellen(1841,14)(500,8) had procured them.
S(495,8)I own, is necessary to me.(1352,8)been a(833,11)ed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment an(429,9).
A military life(1648,8)what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to(222,11)my profession--I
was brought up for t(68,9)(1348,8)should at this time(306,11)in
possession of a most valuable living, had it(871,9)the gentleman we
were(858,13)just now.”

“Indeed!”

“Yes--(1601,18) bequeathed me the next(617,8)ation(1628,12)
living in his gift. He(829,8)god(1722,8)(635,8)ssively attached to me.
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when th(338,8) fell, it was given
elsewhere.”

“Good heavens!” cried (1502,9); “but how could _that_ be? H(21,9)his
will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”

“There was just such an informality in the terms(2045,10)quest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but(2040,11)chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short,(2048,10)or nothing.
Certain it is that(543,12)became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it(1427,8)at(614,13) to another man; and no
less c(148,8)s it,(260,8)cannot accuse myself of having really done
(234,9)to deserve to lose it(1454,9)a warm unguarded temp(941,8)I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely. I can recall(386,8) worse. But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of me(560,8)hat he hates me.”

“This is quite shocking! He(276,8)s to be publicly disgraced.”

“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it sha(1742,9) by _me_. Till I
can forget his (1295,8)I can never defy or expose _him_.”

(1126,9) honoured him for such feeling(2038,9)ought him handsomer than
ever as he express(2012,9)
“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can(2017,11)his motive? what can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?”

“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a(17,9)which(769,10)but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had (1765,19)liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; bu(453,12)’s uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had
not a temper to bear the(753,9)competition in which we stood--(43,8)
of preferenc(320,8)was often given(806,8)I had not(1847,9)(1493,10)so bad as this--though(1086,8)never liked
him, (75,18)so very ill of him--I had suppos(554,12)
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but(1848,9)suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustic(16,10)humanity as
this!”

After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_
remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield,(1981,8)implacability of
his resentments, of his(1535,8)an unforgiving temper. His disposition
must be dreadful.”

“I will not trust(1629,9)n the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can
hardly be just to him(1221,14)was again deep in(1203,8), and(1139,9)time exclaimed, “To
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But(538,9)ented herself
with--“And one, too, who had probably(1394,10)own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner.”

“We were born(39,8)same parish, with(24,15)k; the greatest
part of our youth was pass(154,11): inmates(749,8)same house,
sharing(126,10)amuse(756,8)bject(56,14)parental care. _My_
father began life(247,8)professio(1342,8)your uncle, Mr. Philips,
appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use
to(1667,19), and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by(106,13) most
intimate, confidential friend.(1822,11)often acknowledged himself to
be und(893,8)reatest obligations to my(1828,10)active superintendence;
and when, immediately before(65,13)death,(1983,11)gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it
to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”

“How strange!” cried (1281,9). “How abominable! I wonder that the very
pride of this(1936,11)has not made him(1388,9)you. If from no better
motive,(240,9)should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
(16,9)y I must call it.”

“It _is_ wonderful(1574,21)for almost(748,9)actions may be
traced to pride; and pride has often(1291,10)best(698,9)It has
(1281,10)him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none
of us consistent; and i(122,8)haviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride.”

“Ca(1734,8)(520,9) pride as(2000,8)e ever done him good?”

“Yes; it(275,11)led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. Family pride, and _filial_(20,8)for he is very proud of what(1948,11) was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influenc(1386,19)House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly(240,8)
which, with _some_ (37,9)(1084,10), makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of(154,8)s.”

“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”

He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her(328,8),--very,(1328,8)oud. As a child, she was(1450,10)ate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and I have(1955,9)hours an(10,8)to her amusement. B(183,9)
nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, I understand,(2024,8)accomplished. Since her(1842,15) her
home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and(1965,12)s her
education.”

After many pauses and many trials of other subjects,(1799,10) c(1669,8)
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--

“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can(21,12),
who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly(729,8),
be in friendship with such a man?(126,9)they suit each other? Do you
know(181,12)?”

“Not at all.”

“He is a sweet-tempered,(140,9) charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is.”

“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
want abilities(122,8) be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what (1116,8) the less prosperous. His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich he is(1913,8)-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure.”

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other t(160,9) Mr. Collins t(1524,8)station between his cousin
(999,10)and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when(139,13) began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;
that he considered the money as a mere trif(389,8)begged she w(1341,9)make herself uneasy.

“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
am not in such circumstanc(505,9)make five shillings any object. There
are, undoubtedly, many who(1613,10) say the same; but, thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.”

Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing(862,13)for
a few moments, he asked(1853,11)in a low voice whether her relations
were very intimately acquainted(1218,10)family of D(274,8).

“Lady (302,20)” she replied, “has very lately given him a
living. I hardly know how(1108,13)was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has (1751,8)n her long.”

“You know of course that (211,24) and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters;(1633,10)tly that she is aunt(1607,8)presen(1853,11).”

“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing(1751,8)of(166,15)’s
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday.”

“Her daughter, Miss(778,12)will have a(469,8)rge(1653,8), and it is
believed(270,10)and her cousin will unite the two estates.”

This information made(740,11)smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her(904,10)s, vain and useless her
affection for his sister(207,9)praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.

“(1856,11)(1411,8)she, “speaks highly both(513,18)(343,8)
(437,8); but, from some particulars (1625,8)has relate(549,8)
Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of
her being his patroness,(784,9)n arrogant, conceited woman.”

“I believe her to be bo(1238,8)great degree,”(1126,8)(1368,8); “I have
not seen her for many years; but I(1790,10) remember that(834,9)lik(2003,8)(235,8) her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever(165,8)rather(275,8)
she derives part(993,8)abilities from her rank and(924,10)part from
her authoritative mann(234,10)e rest from the pride(1101,8)nephew, who
chooses that everyone connec(1605,9)him should have an understanding of
the first class.”

(1744,10)allow(1098,8)he had given(1157,8)rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards, and gave(305,10)of the ladies their share of Mr.
(2048,19)s. There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs. Philips’s(163,9)arty, but his(678,9)recommended him to
everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and w(37,11)did, done
gracefully.(1431,11)went away with her head full of him. She could
think of(1767,9)but of Mr.(980,8), and of w(510,11)told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor (1450,11) were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets,(556,8)fish she had lost(899,8)
(26,13)won; and(130,12), in describing the civility(325,8)and(560,13), protesting(1549,9)did not(617,8)least regard his losses

CHAPTER XVII.(86,16)](1209,12)(1890,8)to Jane, the next day, what had passed between(1066,12)(2014,8)self. Jane listen(1373,8)astonishment and concern: she
knew not how to(1883,9)that Mr. Darcy(1147,10)so unworth(578,8)
Bingley’s regard; and yet it(866,9)in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as(2004,8). The
possib(731,9)his having really endured such unkindness was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and(1165,9)therefore remained to be
done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each(1692,8)row into the(1726,12)accident or mistake(1416,10)could not be
otherwise explained.

“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjectu(1013,9)uses or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.”

“Very true, indeed(539,8)w, my dear Jane(966,9)ve you got(1212,8)in
behalf(1516,8)(638,8)(297,10)who have probably been(964,8)ed in the
business? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged(671,10)ill of
somebody.”

“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places(1169,10), to be treating his father’s favourite in such a
manner,--one whom(51,11) had promised to provide fo(637,8)
(626,10). No(1182,8)common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character,(1365,10)capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively(937,9) in him? Oh no.”

“I can much more easily(1510,9)Mr. (1471,10)being imposed on than that
Mr.(1391,8) should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last

so, le(1698,14)ntradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”

“It is difficult(974,8)--it is distressing. One does not know what to
think.”

“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly(56,8) (56,9)But Jane could(1589,8)ith certainty on only one point,--(1961,8)(1927,8), if he _had been_(466,11), would have much to suffer when
the affair became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some(1297,8)very persons of whom
they (223,8) speaking;(718,12) and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield,(1776,8)as
fixed(59,9)following Tuesday. (315,8)(309,12)delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since (262,9)met, and
repeatedly asked what she(301,10)doing with herself(78,10)ir
separation. To the rest(1695,8)family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs. Bennet(1603,12)(1975,8), saying not(650,9)Elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone(306,8)rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from(247,12)’s civilities.

The prospec(338,9)(594,11) ball was extremely agreeable to every
femal(800,9)family.(366,13)chose to(1885,11)t as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the(835,13)rom(907,13)himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to(674,9)a happy evening in the
society of her two(1828,8), and th(666,11)s of(484,14); and
(627,9) thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of(1767,12)in(1721,10)’s look
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any(468,11) person; for though they
each, like(916,11) meant to dance half the(408,9)(276,8) (276,8)
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her(1201,10)at she
had no disinclin(1525,10)it.

“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in(727,9)engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
(1024,10)ntervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody.”
(809,10)’s spirit(2046,8)o high on the(222,9), that(598,8)she did
not oft(1975,8) unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept(1154,12)’s(2019,11), and if he
did,(71,12)would (449,9)proper(440,9)in(750,12)’s

scruple whatever on(43,8)ad(1419,10)very far from dreading a rebuke,
either from the Archbishop or Lad(1081,12)de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.

“I am(956,13)of opinion, I(872,8)you(785,8)he, “that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency(780,8)am so(287,10)objecting(1199,8)ing

soliciting yours, Miss(1390,12)for the two first dances especially; a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her(1032,13) felt(1956,9)completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by(1584,8)(1671,8)se very dances; and to have(1056,12)
instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help
for it, however.(1731,12)’s(1926,13)d her own was perforce

T(265,8)soon reached to conviction,(372,8)observed his increasing
civilities towards(765,8), and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and(1842,8)more astonished than
gratified(888,9)by this effect of her charms, it(568,9)long before
her mother gave her to understa(1707,8)the probability of their marriage

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the

CHAPTER XVIII.(36,19)Till(335,11)entered the drawing-room at(746,12), and looked in
vain for(1879,12) among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of
meeting him(942,14)checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dres(1961,9)more than
usual care, and(1051,8)d(1753,8)highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued(301,8)heart, trusting that(1562,12)(145,10)might be won(1886,8)course(1089,8)evening. But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion(440,15)urposely omitted,(544,9)Darcy’s
pleasure(2021,9)Bingleys’(1220,19)(1111,8)(1856,13)this
(1789,8)exactly the case, the absolute fac(603,9)absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that(776,9)had been obliged to go to town on business
(1483,8)befo(562,8)(2013,8)yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,--

“I do not imagine his(110,9)(1653,12)called him away just now, if
h(1781,10)wished to avoid a(890,8) gentleman here.”

This par(978,9)intelligence,(452,8)unheard by Lydia, was caught by
(1515,9); and, as it assured her that Darcy(751,9)less answerable for
Wickham’(511,10)than if her first surmise(435,10)just, every feeling
of dis(702,8) against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she(1566,9)rdly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
Attention, forbearance,(1845,10)with Darcy, was injury to(1791,8). She
was resolved(275,9)any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of ill-humou(1973,8)(298,10)not wholly surmount even in
speaking to Mr.(1116,8), whose blind partiality provoked her.

But(1814,11)(1350,8)formed for(151,11)(1170,13)every prospect
of her own was destroyed(1511,9)evening, it(213,11)dwell long on her
spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she
(1805,8)seen for a week, she was soon able(545,8) a voluntary
transi(1430,13)ddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her
particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of
distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and
solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong
without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a
disagreeable partner for a couple of(221,8)can give. The moment of her
release from him was ecstasy.

She danced next with an(1883,8), and had the refresh(95,8)talking of(1352,8)(275,8) hearing that he was universally liked. When thos(424,8)
were over, she(1756,9)(707,21)(1801,8)in(1097,18)
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr.(1236,9)ho took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing w(1494,8)did, she accepted him. He walked away again
(1573,9)ly, and(921,9)left to fret over(1112,11)nt of presence of
mind:(1032,11)tried to console her.

“I dare say you will find him very (664,9).”

“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
a man(91,10) whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
evil.”

When the dancing recommenced(1094,11)and Darcy(1800,15)claim her
hand,(1343,11)(1638,10)help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for(1853,8)(1384,9)her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man often times his consequence.(1717,11)made no
answ(990,8)took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
(1570,8)arrived in(1268,8)llowed to stand opposite(1914,8)Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
They stood for some time(901,8) (2046,9)a word;(844,9)began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two(1692,9)and, at
first, was resolved(522,9)reak it; till(1161,10)fancy(1329,9)it
(832,19)r punishmen(1848,8)(1561,9)to oblige him to talk,
she made some slight observation o(805,10)e. He replied(1373,10)again
silent. After a pause of some minutes, she(1364,11)him a second time,
with--

“It is _your_ turn to say something now,(1429,10). _I_ talked about the
dance, and _you_ ought(834,9)some kind of remark(244,8)size of the
room, or the number of couples.”

He smil(282,8)assured her that whatever she wished(395,8)say should be
said.

“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I
may observe that private balls are much (1084,8)er than public ones; but
_now_ we may be silent.”

“Do you talk by rule, then, while you ar(1386,9)?”

“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet,(314,9)advantage of
_some_, conversation(554,10)be so arranged as(1025,9)y may have the
trouble of saying as little as possi(1815,8)Are you consulting your own feelings(1388,8)present case, or do you(1168,14)(359,8)gratifying mine?”

“Both,”(957,8)(1520,11)archly; “for I have always seen a great
similarity(1536,8)turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
(1017,10)that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”

“This is no very striking resemblance of(438,10)character, I am sure,”
said he. “How near it(840,8)to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”

“I must not decide on my own performance.”

He(2038,8) answ(813,8)they were again(867,8)till they had gone down
(1574,9), when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton. She answered(783,8)affirmative; and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaint(321,8)The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not a word; an(953,11), though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,--

“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his
_making_ friends; whether h(1634,9)equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain.”

“He has been so unlucky as to lose your(123,8)hip(1305,20),
with emphasis, “(283,8)(271,8)which he is likely to suffer from all
his life.”

Darcy(876,15), and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to(773,11)side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.
Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.

“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very
(137,9)(102,8)is not often seen. It is evident(1876,10)belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however,(1940,9)r fair(206,8) does not
disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a(782,8) desirable event(285,10)Miss Eliza (glancing
at(1437,11) and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will
then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.
You will not thank me for d(1032,8) you from the bewitching converse of
(458,8)ng lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William’s allusion to his frie(1128,10)to strike him forcibly,(890,8)
eyes were direct(984,11)very serious expression, towards(564,8) and
Jane, who were(993,9)together. Recovering himself(833,11)shortly,
he turned(206,8)partn(1340,9)(1687,9)(1294,11)’s(594,10)ion has made me forget what we were talking
of.”

“I do not think(38,9)speaking at all.(1408,13)(1891,10)have
(721,9)ed any two people in(1370,9) who had less to say for
themselves. We have tried two or thre(1561,9)s already without success,
and(235,9)are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”

“Wha(252,8)you of books?” said he, smiling.

“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with(22,9)
feelings.”

“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of(1860,10)We may compare our different opinions.”

“No--(288,9)(310,8)books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.”

“The _present_(48,8)occupies you in such scenes--does it(385,11)
with a look of doubt.

“Yes, always,” she repli(1948,8)out knowing what she said; for her
thoughts had wandered far(1386,10)subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hear(1484,8)once say,(1581,10),(1473,9) hardly ever forgave;--(1898,10)resentment, once created, was
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_?(675,8),(785,11)with a firm voice.

“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”

“I hope not.”

“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their(723,8),
to be secure of judging properly at first.”

“May I ask to what these questions tend?”

“Merely to the i(1841,11) of _your_ character(309,8)she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”

“A(1254,8)is your(1280,8)?”

She shook her head. (1506,10)get on(1490,9)I hear such(1046,10)
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”

“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, (814,9)were
not to sketch my(392,10) at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear th(52,8)erformance would reflect no credit on either.”

“But if (1882,10)ake your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunit(359,8)would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly(1300,8).
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for
in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.

They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came(141,13) and(1705,8)n expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--

“So, Miss Eliza,(927,8)you are quite delighted with George Wickham?
Your sister has been talk(1100,8)e about him, and asking me a thousand

other communications, that he was the son of old(200,8), the late Mr.
(554,8)steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,(646,8)give
implicit confidence to(538,10)ssertions; for(1813,8)(1949,9)’s using
him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he(403,10)always
remarkably kind to him(834,9)(478,14) has treated(149,10) in a
most infamous manner.(1153,10)know the(1879,11)s, but I know very
well that(94,12)s not in the least to blame;(459,9)cannot bear
to hear(189,16)mentioned; a(588,10)ough my brother thought he
could not well avoid including him in his invitation(1943,8)officers, he
was excessively glad to(724,11)he had taken himself out of the way.
His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and
I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you(1048,14)for this
discovery(1527,8) favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his
descent, on(135,8)not expect much better.”

“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”
said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing
worse than of being(1097,12)(944,12)steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me(518,8).”

“I beg you(1626,9)”(1876,8)(1557,13), turning away with a sneer.
“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”

“I(579,8)girl!” (315,14) to herself. “You are much mistaken if
you(463,8)to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of(1471,10).” She then s(996,8)r eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries(1369,8)same subject of(1946,8). Jane met her(389,9)mile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy(1990,11), as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfi(1953,8)the occurrences(1106,8)evening.
(465,10)instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude
for(1853,10)resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave
way before the hope of Jane’s being(1547,8)fairest way for happiness.

“I want to know,” said she,(790,8)countenance no less smiling than her
sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr.(1827,8). But perhaps(47,9)
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case
you may be sure of my pardon.”

“No(1051,11)Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but(1267,8)(1243,8)satisfactory to tell you. Mr.(1128,8) does(2008,14)whole of his
history, and is quite(935,8)(1749,9)circumstances which have
principally offended(1365,10); but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour, of his friend(165,9)perfectly convinced that
(479,11) has deserved much less attention from(1537,10)(586,8) has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his(1729,10)as well as his(657,11)(150,12)is by no means a respectable young man. I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and(234,14)to lose(1754,12)
regard.”

“(539,26)(316,13)(1746,11)No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”

“T(288,11) then is what(211,8)(360,8)(396,15). I am
(487,10)(1321,9). But what does he say(1322,8)living?”

“He(762,10)exactly recollect(724,18), though(364,8)heard
them(551,16)more than once,(738,8)believes that(1960,8)left to
him _conditionally_ only.”

(1012,12)a doubt of(963,12)’s sincerity(1311,8)(2012,10)warmly,
“but you must excuse my not being(812,11)by assurances only. Mr.
(113,10)defenc(1062,8) friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
since he is unacquaint(1764,8)several part(1762,9)(1155,11)has learnt
the rest from that(136,8)himself, I shall venture still(1447,12)
both gentlemen as I did before.”

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no differ(332,8)sentiment.(450,11)listened with
delight to the happy(669,8)modest hop(1414,9)Jane entertained of(455,11)regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. On their being joined by(1638,13)(402,9)(665,11)ithdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the(1907,9)ness of her last
partner she had scarcely(1856,8), before Mr. Collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation, t(1182,9)d just been so fortunate
as to make a most important discovery.(986,10)found out(957,8)he, “by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman(1503,8) mentioning(623,8)young lady who does the honours of
this house the names(1960,8)cousin Miss De Bourg(804,8)f her mother,
Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of (124,14) de
Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful(417,9)(492,10) is made
in time for me to pay my(2021,8)s to him, which I am now going to do,
and trust he will(1486,15)having done it(1226,8) My total
ignorance(1815,8)connection must plead my apology.”

“You are not(143,10)introduce yourself to(1960,10)?”

“Indeed I am.(1425,9)entreat his pardon for(191,20)earlier.
I(1860,8) him to be(426,15)’s _nephew_. It will be in my(1232,9)
assure him(974,8)r Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”

(1887,10)tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that(301,10) would consider his addressing him without(375,9)tion as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there sh(1725,8)any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong(552,13), the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.(1488,13)(1832,9)to(1474,9)
the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased
speaking,(1620,8) thus,--

“My dear Miss(1977,10), I have the highest opinion(357,8)world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope(59,9)understanding, but permit me to say(1595,12)must be a wide difference

thou(1822,8)e case before us(460,11) myself more fitted by education
and habitual study to decide on what is right(1238,8)young lady like

reception of his advances she eagerly watched(1072,8)ose astonishment at
being so(1482,8)ed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow(1377,8)ough she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw(1526,8)mo(247,12)lips(1192,8)ds “apology,”
“Hunsford,” and “(1931,14) de Bourgh.” It vexed(374,8)see him
expose himself to(1838,8)man.(1817,12)as eye(1798,12)
unrestrained wonder;(1464,10)at last(1567,13)allowed him to speak,
(1485,8)with an(1569,8)distant civility(1642,13), however, was not
discouraged from (1583,8) again, and(2027,10)’s contempt seemed
abundantly increasing(1229,10)length(654,8)second speech; and(1185,8)end of it he only made him a slight(578,10)moved another way: Mr.
(1872,8)then returned to(1754,10).

“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisf(367,9)my(873,10)(496,12)seemed much pleas(416,8)the attention. He answered
me(1530,10)utmos(444,10), and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of (744,14)’s discernment as to be
certain(926,12)ever bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am(300,19)him.”

As(439,10) had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her(380,10) almost entirely on her sister(749,9)Bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made
her perhaps(140,8)as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that
very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could
bestow; and(1395,10)capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
even to like(321,8)’s two sisters. Her mother’s(537,8)s she plainly
saw were bent the same way,(162,9)determined not to venture near her,
lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,
she considered it a most unlucky perversenes(519,8)placed them within
one of each oth(1523,8)deeply was she vexed to find that h(305,9) was
talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing
else bu(829,9)expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.
Bingle(1021,10)an animating subject(1597,8)s. Benne(1588,8) incapable
of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such
a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,
were the first points of self-gratulation(1053,9)n it was such a
comfort to think how fond the(784,12) were of Jane, and(1413,15)that they must desir(1540,8)nnection as much as(1461,11)do. It
was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as
Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;
and, lastly,(307,9)o pleasant at her time of life to be able to
consig(1458,8)ngle(172,10) to the care of thei(1496,8), tha(1039,11)
not be obliged to go into company more than she liked(1769,9)necessary
to make this(1312,13) a matter of pleasure, because on such
occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet(1079,9)(638,8)in staying at home at any period(1849,8)life. She
conclud(1928,8)many good wishes that (1126,10) might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth(1661,10) to check the rapidity(1244,8)(1647,8)
words, or persuade her to describe her(1857,10)in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation(906,11)perceive(973,9)
chief of(1079,8)overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

“What is(98,10) to me, pray, that I sh(1526,8)afraid of him? I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to(870,15)say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”

“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What(1572,10) can it be to you
to offend(345,10)? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing.”

Nothing(1108,10)could say, however, had any influence. H(1996,11)ould
talk(1923,8)views(1345,8)same intelligible tone.(765,11)blushed and
(12,9)gain with shame and(658,9). S(1565,9)not help frequently
glancing her eye at(652,12)(971,9)ery glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for(1030,8)h(990,8)t always look(1183,8)(937,9), she was
(95,10)that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The (918,8)on
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

At length(504,11)Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and(1348,11), who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left(1823,9)omforts of cold ham and chicken.
(1378,10)now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper(1265,9), singi(68,8)alked of, and she
had the mortifica(259,8)seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige(259,8)pany. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties did she(1658,14)prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary w(908,9)understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibit(309,8)delightful to her(317,9) began her song(468,11)’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and
she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope(1455,10)might be
prevailed on to favour them again(608,8)the pause of half a minute
began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for(560,8)display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected(1545,12)was in agonies.
She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane(394,10)(1263,8)ly
talking to Bingley. (92,14)his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each ot(690,9)at(1639,8)who continued(1870,10)
impenetrably grave(142,17)er father to(1029,8) his
interference, lest Mary should be(1162,9)all night. He took(584,9),
and, when Mary had finis(781,8)second song, said aloud,--

“That will do extremely well, child. You have(1508,8)ed us long enough.
Let the other young ladies have time to(1065,8).”

Mar(1983,10)pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and(1554,10), sorry for(1136,11)(19,12) father’s speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good. Other(967,9)party were now applied to.

“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging(1598,12)(1240,8)
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean(808,11)to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our(576,8)
music, for there are certainly other thing(349,9)ttended to. The
rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such
an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. He must write his own serm(1777,8) the time
that remains will not be(322,10)for his(236,8)duties,(70,9)care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused fro(1365,9)as comfortable as possible. And(542,10)think it of light importance
that he(1288,8)have attentive and conciliatory manners towards
everybody, especially(30,8) those to whom he owes his preferment. I
cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well(2028,8)man who(971,8)omit an occa(823,8)testifying his respect(168,9)anybody
connected(895,10)family.” And with a bow to Mr.(1714,8)he concluded
hi(1272,11)hich had been spoken so loud(1174,10)heard by half the
room. Many stared--many smiled; but no on(2025,9)more amused than Mr.
Bennet(783,8), while his wife seriously commende(1355,13) for
having(187,11)sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady
Lucas, (620,8)was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.

To (1663,9) it appeared(84,8)ad her family made (1074,13)to
expose themselves (1161,8)as they could dur(1509,8)evening, it would
have been im(878,8)(1313,8)m to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she(947,10)for Bingley and her sister
that some(1837,8)exhibition had escaped his notice(1161,8)at his
feelings(1888,8)t of a sort to be much distressed by the folly(1191,9)
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and(822,13)owever, sh(350,10)such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt(1101,8)gentleman, or
the insolent smiles(1142,8)ladies, were more intolerable.

The res(89,9)evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
(911,11), who continued most perseveringly by her side(1725,8)ough he
(273,10)prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
pow(49,17)others. In vain(710,9)entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offered to introduce(61,8)any young lady in(1318,11)He assured her that, as(215,8)ing,(1143,8)perfectly indifferent
to it;(794,9) chief object was, by delicat(1823,9)ons, to recommend
himself to her(384,8)(1888,13)therefore make a point of remaining
close to (683,8)whol(1166,9). There was no arguing upon such a
project. She owed her greatest relie(166,8) friend Miss Lucas, who
often joined them, and good-naturedly engag(1588,14)’s conversation
to herself.

(735,8)at least free from the offence of(1885,10)’s further notice:
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt i(1306,8)the
probable consequ(187,8)her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait(1712,8)ir carriage a quarter of an
hour after every(937,9) was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by(1725,13)family. Mrs. Hurst(1776,8)
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
every at(1591,9)(360,12)at(766,13), and, by so doing, threw a
languor ov(999,13)party(350,8)was very(1578,8)reliev(1930,10)long

(1953,8)on the eleg(823,8)their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had mark(432,9)behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr(714,8), in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
(234,16)Jane were(1077,10)together a(1933,8)detached(1174,9)
res(243,8)alked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either(746,12)or Miss(407,8); and even Lydia was too
much(725,8)d to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,
how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.

When at length they arose to take leave,(1138,13)was most pressingly
civil in her hope of see(440,8)whol(1035,8) soon at(1304,10); and
addressed(1623,8) particularly(1391,8)Bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a(133,8)dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation(884,10)was all grateful
pleasure; and he readi(1886,11)for tak(734,8)earliest opportunity of
waiting on he(1471,8)his return from London, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.

(488,16)perfectly satisfied; and quitte(1068,8)use under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing(1708,8) necessary preparations of
settlements, new(1749,9)s, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
months. Of having anot(89,13)married(683,8)Collins she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, (594,8).
(1175,10)was the least dear to her of all her children; and(89,8)the
man(1525,9)match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by(1675,17)(360,11).

CHAPTER XIX.(88,16)]

T(753,12)opened a new scene(1159,13).(438,13)made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it (1082,8)loss of time, as
his leave of absence extend(1658,11)the fo(805,8)Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding(1140,12),(1902,10), and one(60,8)younger girls(2015,9), soon
after breakfast, he (1616,10)the mother in these words,--

“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fai(1101,11)(177,10)
when I solicit(1250,9)honour of a private audience with (153,10)
(1150,12)is morning?”

Before(289,10) had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet instantly answered,--

“Oh dear! Yes,(1185,8)ly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--(36,9)
she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And
gathering her work(498,12)he was hastening away, when(577,10)
called out,--

“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will(23,9)(1035,13)ust excuse
me. H(223,13)thing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am
go(183,8) myself.”

“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire(167,10)stay where you are.” And
upo(261,11)’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
(1801,11).”
(1719,12)ould not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s
(1823,9)tion mak(546,8)also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal, by incessant employment, the(1457,10)whi(1891,8)divided
between(1459,9) and diversion. (1312,11) and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone,(1750,13)began,--

“Believe me, my dear Miss(1412,12)that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
mother’s permission for this(1619,8). You can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions(295,11)too marked to be mistaken. Almost(531,12)I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life. But before I am run away with by my(750,10)on this
subject, perhaps it(1603,9)advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as I(1776,10) did.”

The idea of(1552,12), with all his solemn composure, being(282,9)
(282,8)his(1033,9), mad(1998,12)so near laughing that she c(1321,8)
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continu(2040,8)M(362,13) (362,8) are, first,(820,8)think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish; secondly(143,9)am convinced(598,9)add
very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which(668,9)I ought to
have mentioned earlier,(1633,9)is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom(1163,8)the honour of calling
patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
too!)(913,8) subject; and it was but(162,10)Saturday nigh(1010,10)
left Hunsford,--(1725,8)our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--(774,9)said, ‘(903,13)you
must marry. A(637,11)like you (33,12)Choose properly, choose a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to(441,10) and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin(1047,9)do not reckon the not(778,8)kindness of Lady Catherine d(504,8) as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond
anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity,(1259,8), must be
accept(436,8)her, especially when tempered(1653,10)silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour (1333,12); it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father (who, however, may live many years longer), I(1884,10) satisfy
myself without resolving to(1070,9) wife from among his daughter(216,8)the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
event takes place--which(225,11)as(1598,8)already said, may not be
for several years. This has been my moti(991,20)and I
flatter myself(1896,9)not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
(656,8)for me but to (578,11)in the most animated language(1035,8)violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it(583,11)be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents., which(354,10)be yours till after your mother’s
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent:(1326,8) may(442,11)rself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when w(1079,8)rried.”

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget(1719,8)have made no
answer. Let me do it(1033,9)further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
th(517,8)ment you are paying me. I am very sensibl(737,8) honour of
your proposals, but it is im(1077,9)for me to do otherwise than decline
them.”

“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wav(900,9)hand, “(764,8)is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses(2008,8)man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour(873,11)sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third ti(415,8), (790,11)by no means discouraged by w(876,8)have
just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”

“Upon my word(706,8)cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an
extraordinary on(1845,8)my declaration. I d(1402,13)that (541,8)
one of thos(1984,8)ladies (if suc(485,16)(2042,8)) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being ask(417,11)
(401,10)(1490,11)serious in my(481,8). You(2001,11)make _me_
happy, and I am convinced(250,11)the last woman(1677,8)world who
would make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified(757,8)
situation.”

“Were it certain that(134,16)would think so,” sai(1010,14)
very gravely--“but I cannot imagine(1589,8)r Ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. A(1588,11)be(164,14)when(1413,8)(1277,14)seeing her again(1688,9)speak(415,8)highest terms of(1815,8)desty,
economy, and other amiable(339,8)cations.”

“Indeed,(1286,14)all praise of me wi(1821,8)(1684,9). You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me (1576,15)of
believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being(1601,10).
In making(169,8)offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy(394,8)
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls,(1950,9)any self-reproach. This matter may be
considered(1502,13)as finally settled.” And rising as she thus
spoke,(954,11)have quitted the room, had not(1876,12) thus
(1798,8)d her,--

“When I do myself(780,14) speaking to you next(1342,8)subject, I
(1644,14)receive a more favourable answer than(1720,9) now given
me; though I am far from acc(602,9) of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom(946,9)sex to reject a man on the
(2037,11)cation, and, perhaps,(195,10)even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the tru(718,14)the
female character.”

“Really(1077,14)(1970,19)with some warm(1988,8) puzzle me
exceedingly. If(1023,8)have hitherto said can appear(528,8)in the form
of (239,9)ment, I know not how to express(1851,11) in such a way as
may(1831,9)(497,8)its(1064,8)ne.”

“(1272,8) (1272,17)flatte(1270,10)my dear cousin, that your
(131,8)of my (798,8)s are merely words of course. My reasons for(1334,11)it are briefly these:--It does not(316,11)me that my hand
is unworth(1218,9) acceptance, or that(717,14)ment I can offer
(601,9)any oth(875,8)highly desirable. My (1992,9) in life, my
connections(660,10)family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your
own, are circumstances(136,8)in my favour; and you should take it into
further (1341,8)ation that, in spit(2030,8)r manifold attractions, it is
by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.
Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects(1163,9)loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,
(1609,11)conclude(735,9) are not serious in your rejection of me(1472,10)choose to attribute it(469,8) wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”

“I do assure you, sir, t(1165,11)no pretensions whatever to that kind
(94,9)ce which(1382,8)s in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
again and again for(1885,12)(1791,9)done me(415,9)proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossi(979,8)feelings in every(227,8)
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not(872,9) me now as an(430,8)(1670,8)inten(480,8)plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart(1492,9)are uniformly charming!(1753,8)he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the(1688,8)
authority of both your excellent parents, my(426,10) will not fail of
being(1474,8)ble.”

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception(1986,10) would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined(1177,8)f he
persisted in(1375,9)ing her repeated(1956,8)s as(1879,8)ing

not be mistake(875,10)affectation and coquetry of(728,11) female.

CHAPTER XX.(33,19)Mr. Collins was not left lo(1282,10)silent contempla(1406,8)his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch(1129,9)end of the conference, no sooner saw(615,11)open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. (407,11)
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars(148,10)interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had(1462,9)ason to be satisfied, since the
refusal(72,8)is cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
(1413,9)bashful modesty(245,8) genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled(721,12): she would have been
glad to be equally(250,10) that her daughter had meant to (1168,9)
him by protesting against his(1883,15) she dared not(1998,8) it,
and could not help saying so.

“But depend upon it,(626,12),” she added, “that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak(1355,8)about it myself directly. She is
a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it.”

“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,(1957,8)(1300,11); “but if she
is reall(177,12) and(180,8), I know not whether(558,10)
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
(767,10)looks for happiness(1364,8)marriage state. If, therefore, she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of
temper, she(690,11)contribute much to my(1260,8)y.”

“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” sai(952,13), alarmed. “Lizzy is
on(461,14)(2004,8)matters as these. In everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived(799,9)go(773,9) to Mr(159,11)nd
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”

S(1167,9)not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out, as she (1807,12)library,--

“Oh,(193,13)you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
You must come and make Lizzy marry(1179,13) for she vows she will
not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and(71,10)_her_.”

(417,10) raised his eyes from his book(301,15), and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not(973,8)least altered by
her communication.

“I have not the(2045,9) of (791,10)(1262,8)” said he, when she had
finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”

“Of(1591,12) and Lizzy. Lizzy declare(424,10) (424,9)(1647,12)
an(1397,13) begins to say(1854,8)(65,15)Lizzy.”

“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”

“S(1720,8)Lizzy(1722,10)yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.”

“Let her be(857,8)down. Sh(1000,8)hear my opinion.”

(1204,11) rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

“Come here, child(1765,9)her father(1000,8)appeared. (592,8)sent for
you on an affair of importance. I(615,11) that(536,13)has made
you an offer of(1706,9). Is it true?”

(222,10)replied that it was.

“Very well--and this(86,18) you have refused?”(811,9), sir.”(75,12). We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
(1785,10)it(203,8)not so,(1665,12)?”

“Yes, or(1551,8)never see her again.”

“An unhappy alternative is before you,(518,10). From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents(223,14)(151,15)you
again(1361,11)_not_(1436,20)and(217,18)you again
if you _do_.(486,13)(2042,10)but smile at such a conclusion of(21,8)beginning;
but(2024,14)who had persuaded herself(1099,8)r husband regarded the
affai(783,9)wished, was excessively disappointed.

“What do you mean(1812,14)by(1330,8) in this way? You promised me
to _insist_(1104,9) (1104,17)My dear,”(793,9)(205,11),(952,9)two small favours to request.
First,(1222,10)will allow me the free use of my(1603,15)on the
present(1379,9); and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have(1197,12) to myself as soon as may be.”

Not yet, however, in spite of her(409,11)ment in(285,14)did(1371,13)give up(999,12)She talked to(1380,11)again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and(1555,10), sometimes with real earnestness, and
(37,15)playful gaiety,(1402,10)o her attacks. Though her manner
varied(409,11)her determination never did.

(1074,13)meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend(65,9)motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary(100,8)e possibility of her
deserving he(1652,8)’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

While the family were(1151,9)confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! (1397,12)think has happened this morning?(1700,12) has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have(1404,8)[Illustration:

(358,10)had hardly time to answer(2006,8)they were joined by Kitty,
who(416,9)tell the same news; and no sooner had (156,16)
(156,9)-room, where(1851,12) was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas(766,9)compassion, and entreating
her to(1957,9) her friend Lizzy(963,8)l(642,10) wishes(811,8)family. “Pray do, my dear(138,11),” she added, in a melancholy tone;
“for nobody is on my side,(22,8)takes part with me; I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves.”(525,11)’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane(1503,14).

“Ay, there she comes,” continued(468,12), “looking as unconcerned as
may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she
can have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss(881,8)if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriag(1243,10)way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
you(1396,8)library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
and (290,9)find me as good as my word(159,9)no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. Not(138,8)have much(64,9), indeed,(73,15)anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints (632,8)
no great inclination for(177,8). Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
is always so. Those who(544,8)(123,8) are never pitied.”

Her daughters listened in silence to this ef(1922,8)sensible that any
attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
(1681,20)(1871,11), who(1792,9)with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--

“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let(188,12) and me have a little conversation together.”

(1408,9) passed quietly out of the room,(1459,10)Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and (1598,9),
detained first(1595,8)civility of(424,17)se inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by(304,9)
curiosity, satisfied (87,8)with walking(472,8)window and pretending
not(248,8). In a doleful voice(1745,12) thus began the projected
(444,12):--

“Oh,(687,12)!”

“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me,” he presently(1933,10), in a voice that marked his
dis(1311,10)“to resent the behaviour of you(1118,10). Resign(678,8)
inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar(29,9)a young man
who has been so fortunate as(1714,8)been, in early preferment; and, I
trust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed, that r(328,11)is(1848,8)o perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.
Y(1919,8)not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your
family, m(717,13) by thus withdrawing my pretensions(66,9)(1706,8)’s favour(1560,10)having paid you(1059,10)Mr(901,11)e

CHAPTER XXI.(34,19)The discussion(1676,15)’s offer was now nearly at an end, and(1904,11)had only to suffer from the uncomfortable(1093,8)s necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allu(184,8)her mother.
As(391,9)gentleman himself, _his_(130,10)were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to
her;(2004,8) assiduous attentions which he had(1554,9)sensible of
himself were transferred(687,9)rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abate(1214,8)Mrs(1244,8)’s ill humour or ill
health.(713,12) was also in the same state of angry pride. (718,9)
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear(127,8)least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to (17,8) he still meant to stay.

After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned(128,9)lament over his absence(1010,10)Netherfield ball.
He joined them on their entering the town, and attend(46,8)to their
aunt’s, where his regret and vexation(816,9)concern of everybody were
well talked over. To(511,10), however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of(272,13)_had_ been self-imposed.

“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy;--that to be(747,13)room,(762,10)party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to(66,11)myself.”

She highly approved his forbearance(1275,9)y had leisure for a full

bestowed on each other, as(774,8) and another officer(839,8)back with
(682,8)Longbourn, and du(735,9)walk he particularly(746,11)o her.
His accompanying the(1379,8)double advantage: she felt(240,8)
compliment it offer(93,9)self; and it was most acceptable as an
(1915,8) of introducing him(1463,9)ather and(1914,9)

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

Soon after their return, a letter was deliv(226,8)Miss Bennet; it came
from(1168,12), and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s
fair, flowing hand; and(1660,10) saw her sister’s countenance change as
she read(757,9)(56,8)dwelling intently on som(632,12) passages.
Jane recollected(552,8) soon; and putt(1443,8)letter away, tried to
join, with her usual cheerfulness,(1919,8)general conversation: but
(258,10)felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from(1731,8); and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a gla(1752,9)Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they
had ga(1782,8)ir own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is
from Caroline Bingley: what it(679,8)s has surprised me a good deal.
The whol(1540,8)have left(1966,14)y this time, and are(1967,10)way
to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear
what she says(1554,8)then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved(439,11)their brother to town directly,
and (76,9)meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.
Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to
regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the
meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these
high-flown expressions(1422,11)listen(1479,9)ll the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness(587,10)removal(940,11)her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament:(1980,8)not to be supposed that their
abse(1211,9)(993,12)would prevent Mr.(1105,8)’s being there; and as
to the lo(194,12)(595,9)she was persuad(132,8)Jane must soon
cease to regard it(1551,8)enjoyment of his.

“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope(345,9) period of(800,8)happiness, to which Miss(1447,8) looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, an(461,10)(861,11)
(861,12)you(862,11) as(225,9)will be renew(699,8)yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?(527,12) will not be detained in London by
them.”

“(1692,9)decidedly says that none of th(1658,8)will return into
(1212,14)this winter. I(46,8)ad it to you.

“‘When my(1472,9)left us yesterday, he imagin(796,11) business which
took him to(219,8)might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinc(951,8)when
Charles gets(1681,9)he(466,9)in no hurry to(1533,8)t again,(1392,8)
determined on following him thither, that he may(487,8)obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter: I wish I could hear (978,8), my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one(1114,8)crowd, but(1702,9)I
despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas(1873,18)may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings(977,11)your beaux
(935,8)so numerous as to(1438,9)your feeling(1414,16)(656,8)f
whom we shall deprive you.’(1358,9)evident by this,” added Jan(1347,9)he comes back no more this
winter.”(1438,9)only(85,9)that(1269,14)does not mean he _should_.”

“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is(21,9)master.
But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me(1137,9)have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is
impatient(1646,8)hi(1363,8); and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely
less eager to meet her again. I really(240,8)think Georgiana Darcy has
her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection
she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still
more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being
hereafter our sister. I(502,13)whether I ever(2017,8)mentioned to
you my(845,8)s on this subject, but(1645,8)not leave the country
without confiding them, and I trust you(1848,10)esteem them
unreasonable. M(1718,10)admires her greatly already;(1530,9)have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her
relations all wish the connection as much a(885,9); and a sister’s
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call (1760,8)most
capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing(1362,12)it, am I wrong(1632,13)Jane, in indulg(1395,8)hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?’ Wha(938,8)you of _this_ sentence(1763,9) Lizzy?” said
Jane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Doe(26,9)expressly
declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be he(879,8);
that she is perfectly convinced(946,9)rother’s indifference(1116,8)at
if she suspects the nature of(928,13)for him she means (most
kindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the
subject?”

“Yes, there can; for mine is totally (205,8)t. W(1721,8)hear it?”

“Most willingly.”

“You sha(1611,8)it in a few words.(1842,14)sees that(329,12) is
in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follow(37,8)
town in(723,13)keeping him there, and tries to persuade you(156,8)
(2011,9)care about you.”

Jane shook her head.

“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his(1709,10);(334,13), I am sure, cannot: she
is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half(1291,9)love in Mr.
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand(16,8)for them; and(213,8)the more anxious to get(533,11)(175,8)(1657,8),(1929,10)notion
that whe(832,8)has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my
dearest(642,11)cannot seriously imagine that, because(931,13)
tells you(931,13)(1973,9)dmires(904,11), he is(886,8)smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday; or that it will be in her power(970,13)him that, instead
of being (1129,16)(191,8)very much(34,14)her friend.”

“If we thought alike of(918,14)” replied Jane, “your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust.(1775,10)is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, (1811,12)deceived
herself.”

“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine:(1346,9)her to be(141,9), by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”

“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wish(1697,9)o marry
elsewhere?(1895,8)must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two(193,9)is
more than equivalent to the happiness (882,9)his wife, I advise you,
(440,12), to refuse him.”

“How can you talk so?” sai(857,8)faintly smiling; “y(295,8)know, that,
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate.”

“I did not think you would; a(345,8)be(545,8)case, I(1428,8)consider
your situation with much compassion(665,8) if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months.”

The idea of his returning(126,9)(631,9) treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the sugges(1311,8)(1239,8)’s
interested wishes; and she(1132,11)for a moment suppose(733,8)ose
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.

She (1521,9)(236,10)(1103,8)as forcibly as possible, w(1390,8)felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane’s temper was not desponding(332,10)was gradually led to hope(836,9)the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.

They agreed that Mrs. Bennet(999,8)only hear of the departure of the
family, withou(940,8)alarmed on the sco(50,9) gentleman’s conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
(721,8)bewailed it as(1194,13)unlucky(1458,10)ladies(1240,8)happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it(819,9), at some length, she had the consolation of
thinking(416,8). (511,14)be soon down again, and soon dining at
Longbourn(1364,8)e conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,
that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take
care to have two full courses.

CHAPTER XXII.(35,19)The Bennets were engaged to dine(1362,10)Lucas(1280,8)again, during the
chief(752,9)ay, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
(1490,11)ook an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good
humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”

Charlotte assured her friend(1046,8)satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice(1137,8)time. This was
very amiable; but (160,9)’s kindness extended farther than(1833,10)
had any conception of:--its object(1448,8)hing less than to secure her
from any(1355,8)of(456,12)’s addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. Such(559,15)’s scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night(844,12)have felt almost
(1734,9)uccess if(935,8)not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.
But here she did injustice to the fire and(1982,11)ce of his
character; for it led him to escape out of (1177,9) House the next
morning with admirable slyness(1990,8)(889,8)Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the not(693,8)is cousins,
from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he(682,8) willing(1310,10)he attempt known
till its(486,9)c(1546,8)known likewise; for(1455,9)feeling(554,9)ecure, and with reason, for(910,10)(1506,10)tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His
reception(1827,11)was(1409,8)most flattering kind.(1422,11)
perceived him from an upper window as he walked(948,8) the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But(1273,8)had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

In as short a time as(1176,15)long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between(1211,8) the(1527,14)of both; and as
they entered(304,12)he earnestly entrea(194,9)o name(1852,8) that

excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and(551,13)gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever(1246,12)
sh(1749,8)in possession(1556,8)Longbourn estate, it w(1800,8)highly
expedient that both he(466,9)wife sh(923,10)their appearance at St.
James’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the
occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two

herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time
to consider of it. Her reflections were in general(1712,10)ory. Mr.
Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was
irksome,(1013,9)attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would
be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,
marriage had always been her object:(1356,8)the only honourable
provision for well-educated young women of small(1270,8), and, however
uncertain of giving(1853,10),(275,9)their pleasantest preservative
from want. This(29,13) she had now obtained; and at the age of
twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good
luck(624,8)The least(538,10) (1629,12) in the business(366,8)
surprise it must (998,8) to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she
valued beyond that of any other person.(79,11)would wonder, and
probably(1280,8)lame her(1028,8)ough her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings(746,9)hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved
to give her the information herself(1178,9)refore charged(2022,12),
when he returned to(1523,11)to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
pass(1745,9) any(1597,8)family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept(657,9)difficulty; for the
curiosity (1899,9)y his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evad(1240,8)e was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.

As(51,8)to begin his journey too early on the morrow to se(433,8)
(433,10), the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies
moved(396,8) night; and Mrs.(932,10)ith great politeness and
cordiality, said how happy they should be(191,8)him at(694,11)again,
whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.

“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very (1562,8)that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible.”

They were all astonish(1532,8)Mr(411,11)ho could by no means wish for
so speedy a(787,9)immediately said,--

“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s(1261,15) here, my
good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.”(487,11)sir,”(482,8)(1317,13) “I am(480,13) obliged to you
for this friendly caution,(460,8) may depend upon my not taking so
material a step(1908,10)er Ladyship’s concurrence.”

“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I(940,8)think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no off(266,9)Believe me, m(470,11) my gratitude is warml(1566,13)such
affectionate attention; and,(443,13)it, you will speedily(958,8)
from me a letter of thanks (551,9)as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,
though my(1783,9)may(1865,8)long enough to render it necessary,(1129,8)
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth.”

With proper civilities,(1625,11) then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.(1687,12) wished
to understand by it(73,9)thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and Mary might(1540,11)prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much hig(970,9)any of the others: there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no
means so clever as herself, s(287,11)that, if encouraged to read and
improve himself(900,8) an example(91,8), he might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with(738,10) related the event(425,8)day before.

The possibility of(1672,12)’s fancying(311,9)in love with her
friend had once occurred to(143,11)within the last day or two: but
that Charlotte could(458,10) him seemed almost as far from(194,12)
as that sh(70,22)herself; and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
(131,10)not help crying out,--

“Eng(681,8)(2048,11)!(1613,9)(274,9), impossible!”

The steady countenance which(591,12)had commanded in telling her
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied,--

“Why(2023,8)you be (1413,9)(1926,10)Eliza? Do you think it incredible
that(749,12)(84,8)be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”

But(938,11)had now recollected(678,13), making a strong effort
for it, was(179,9)assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the
prospec(1052,8)ir relationship was highly grateful to her, a(1771,8)she
wished her all imaginable(1942,10).

“I see what you are feeling,”(484,8)(1029,10); “you must(485,14)
very much(506,12)so lately as(472,13)was wishing to marry you.
But when you have had time to(565,10)all over, I hope you will be
satisfi(482,8)what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never
was. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering(1450,14)
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of(442,10) with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.”

(1700,10)quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,
they returned to the res(1769,9)family.(1622,11)did not stay much
longer; and(1709,12)as then left to reflect on w(1629,8)had heard. It
was a long time before she became at all reconcil(180,10)idea of so
unsuitable a match. The strangeness(1955,18)making two offers
of(375,10)(1913,9)ree days(1193,8)hing in comparison of his being now
accepted. She had always felt (1972,14)’s(1303,8) of matrimony was
not exactly like her own; bu(1963,12)not have supposed it (1783,8)
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage(557,11), the wife(370,15), was a
most humiliating picture! An(656,9)pang of a friend disgracing
herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that(1902,8)im(300,8) for that(120,8)to be(1549,9)y happy in the lot
(723,8)chosen.

CHAPTER XXIII.(122,16)](1076,12)was sitting with her mother and sisters,(948,8)ing(951,8)(228,9)heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement(1220,8)(1208,8)With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the (2013,12)a(1556,11) between the
houses, he unfol(622,8)matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, p(605,37); and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--

“Good Lord!(470,12), how can you tell such a story? Do not(1996,9)
that(1939,12) wants to marry Lizzy?”

Nothing less than the complais(1919,8)a courtier c(1237,10)borne
without anger such treatment: but(671,12)’s good-breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive a(651,8)
truth(1596,8)information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.(1024,11), (1472,8)it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from(1817,10)(95,8); and
endeavoured to put a stop(1587,8)exclamations of(1248,24)
by the earnestnes(46,9)con(1039,11)s to(729,14)in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from(1113,8)ch,(234,8)ellent character
(1900,16)and the convenient dist(806,8)Hunsford from London.

(1147,11) was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while
(1511,12)remained; but no sooner had he left them than her(683,8)s
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of(1445,11); secondly,(1726,9)very sure (1175,16)
had been taken in; thir(63,9)trusted that they would never be happy
together; and, fourthly,(56,9) match(523,10)broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduc(572,12)whole: one, that(1047,10) was the real cause of(1138,8) mischief(1249,8)e other, that
sh(932,9) (286,9)barbarously used by them(1320,10)on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest(447,8)day. (1550,8)could
console and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see (320,11)ithout
scolding her: a month passed away(73,19)peak(1125,15)
or Lady Lucas(94,8) being rude; and many months were gone(171,11)
could at all forgive their daughter.

Mr(1006,8)’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that(1574,11)Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more(30,9)than his(320,9)!

Jane confessed(1807,9)a little surprised (987,12): but she said
l(1666,11)astonishment than(1737,8)earnest desire for their (1601,9);
nor could(671,11)persuade(2022,8)consider it as improbable. Kitty and
Lydia were far from envying Miss(371,8)for(1653,12) was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.

(803,11)could not be in(478,8) of triumph on being able to retort on(1777,13)the comfort of having a(817,9) well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual(1843,8)how happy(1658,8),
though (1923,11)’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive(546,10) away.

Between(1221,11)and(849,11)there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent(1054,8)subject; an(648,12)felt(653,9)d that no
real confidenc(1378,8)ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in(1043,11)m(754,9)urn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicac(420,9) sure her opinion could
(2018,9)shaken, and for whos(385,12)she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week,(1760,13)was heard of his return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear(414,8)The promised
letter of thanks from(1078,13)arrived on Tuesday, addres(1473,9)eir
fath(166,9)ritten with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelve-month’s abode in the family(842,12)prompted. After
discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,
with many rapturous expressions,(457,8)(947,10)in(1160,8)obtained the
affection of their amiable neighbour,(1452,13)and then explained
that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society(239,8)(1899,10)so ready to close(73,9)ir kind wish of seeing him again at
(1335,9), whither he hoped to be(1464,12)urn on Monday fortnight;
for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that
she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would
be an unanswerable argument with his(435,9)(1403,11)o nam(938,10)
day for mak(312,8)the happiest of men.

(1928,11)’(1034,8) into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to(1669,12). On the contrary,(1295,9)as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. It was very strange(591,9)should come
to(1870,11)instead of to Lucas Lodge;(703,8)also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated(2026,8)visitors(1046,8)house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of(389,12)(960,9)y
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued
absence.

Neither Jane nor(1968,11)were comfortable on this(2016,8). Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton(1771,8)coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a (99,13)highly incensed Mrs.
(363,12)(138,8)e never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

Even(341,11)began to fear--not that(422,8) was(599,12)--but that
his sisters would be successful in keep(1371,9)way. Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’(1669,11), and so
dishonour(1424,8)the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring. The united efforts(1806,8)two unfeeling(263,8),
and(1840,8)overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy(1820,8) amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength(1988,8)attachment.

As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under(860,8)spense was, of course, more
painful tha(597,11)’s: but whatever she felt(1446,9)desirous of
concealing; and between herself and(1029,10), therefore, the(1020,8)
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom(1089,8)in(891,11)did not talk of(1230,8), express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
(108,8)come back s(1683,10)think(293,9)very ill-used. It needed all
Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity(2003,14) returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at(1876,11)was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal(1560,11)pany. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometime(378,11)to(319,11)only in time
to make an apology(651,10)bsence before the family went to bed.

[Illustration:

     “_When(982,9)spoke in a low voice_”
]

Mrs. Bennet was really in(1696,8)pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
wher(1163,9)wen(1163,10)sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her(1794,8)or in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. (354,9)Charlotte came to see
them(1740,8)nclu(80,8)to be anticipat(300,8)hour of possession;(275,8)(456,30) to (1008,11), was convinced that
they were talking of the(982,11)estate, and resolving to tur(1510,9)
and her daughters out(77,8)house as soon as Mr(604,13)dead. She
complained bitterly of all thi(429,8) husband.

“Indeed,(83,11),” said she, “it is very hard to think that(418,10)
Lucas(1437,8)ever be mistress of this(524,8)that _I_(1485,8)be forced(952,9)way for _her_, and liv(516,8) her take my place in it!”

“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
better thing(31,10)flatter ourselves(199,10)may be the survivor.”

This(1494,9)very consoling to (1059,11); and(2013,13)instead of
making any answer,(967,10)on as before.

“I cannot bear(429,15)they(1855,8)have(535,10)estate. If it was
not(1548,9)entail, I(1916,8)not mind it.”

“What(28,12)you mind?”

“(54,18)(1238,9)at all.”

“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.”

“I never can(86,12)(745,13) for(142,11)bout(241,11). How

Wh(454,9)_he_ have it more than anybody else?”

“I leave it to yourself to determine(1014,8)(1115,10).


(1798,15)]




CHAPTER XXIV.(35,19)Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt(1794,11)first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and(1591,11)with her brother’s regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Ja(644,9)attend to the rest of
the lett(1053,8)found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline
boasted joyfully(496,10)increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishmen(1878,9)wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of(595,15)being an
inmat(982,9)(321,8)house, and mention(666,8)raptures some plans(492,9)atter with regard to new furniture.

Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated (443,13)(1565,8),
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister and resentment against all others. To(526,9)’s
asser(687,8)(353,20)partial to(673,11), she paid no
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no(1371,11)she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
c(1870,9)think without anger, hardly(22,9)contempt, on that easiness
of temp(957,9)want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing(1237,8), and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the capri(1447,12)inclinations. Had(60,18), however, been
the only(112,10), he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best; but(664,11)’s was involved in it, as
s(58,11)he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulg(1832,8)(102,8)unavailing. S(570,9)think of nothing else; and yet, whether(1932,11)regard had
really died away, or were suppressed by(1756,12)’ interference;
(96,8)he(1344,10)aware(841,8)’s attachment, or(147,9)it had
escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of
him(402,9)materially affected by the difference,(500,13)
situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.

A day or two passed(2033,8)Jane had courage to speak(1570,8)feelings to(1450,10); but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,--

“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no
idea(1924,8)pain she gives me by her continual(810,11)s on him. But I
will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before.”(1856,11) looked a(1068,12) with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

“You doubt me,” cried(1650,8)lightly colouring; “indeed, you(319,9)reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance but that is all. I(422,8)thing either to hope or fear, an(215,9) to reproach him with. Thank God(83,11) _that_ pain. A little
time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”

With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been(2041,11)an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself.”

“My dear Jane,” exclaimed (1038,9), “you are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.”

Miss Bennet eagerly dis(226,8)all extraordinary merit(330,8)rew back
the praise on(1960,16)rm affection.

“Nay,” sai(322,14)this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want
(90,9)_you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
whom I(589,8)love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
of the world t(28,8)am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief(1606,8)inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of(1299,8)merit
or sense(1337,9)met with two instances lately: one I (1720,9)mention,
the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it
(35,17)(1127,12)Lizzy,(1028,8)give way to such feelings as these. They will
ruin your happiness. You(1106,8)make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s(901,10)ility, and
(286,12)prudent, steady(493,10). Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody’s sake,(130,10)may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin.”

“To oblige you, I would(1818,8)believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a(854,8)as this; for were I persuaded that(390,10) had any regard for him, I should only(1046,8)orse of her
understanding than I now do of her heart. (1831,13)(547,12) is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as
I do;(1439,9)must feel(36,12) I do, that the woman who marries him
cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though
it(1039,13) Lucas(56,15), for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to(506,9)
(1708,9)or m(728,9)elfishness i(914,8)ce, and insensibility of
danger security fo(1104,12)”

“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied
Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together. But(1231,8)of this. You alluded to(976,11)else. You
mentioned _two_(1549,10). I cannot mis(774,10) you, but I entreat
you,(1468,13)not to pain me by(592,9) _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so (1249,9)fancy
ourselves intentionally injured(66,14)expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect(1778,8)very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does.”

“And men take care(1000,9)y should.”

“If it is designedly done, they(476,8)be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”

“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”
said Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error and(23,14)misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people’s feelings, and (50,8)resolution,
will do the bus(1124,10)And do you impute it to either of those?”

“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I
think of(452,9)you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”

“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him(191,8), in conjunction with his friend.”

“(1171,9)believe it. Wh(760,8) they try to(102,15) They can
only wish his(1495,10); and if he is attached to me n(473,8)woman can
secure it(256,8)r first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
(1635,9): t(49,13)his increase of wealth and consequence; they
(54,11)m to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.”

“Beyond a doubt they do(118,13)choose Miss Darcy(1785,10) Jane;
“but this(895,8)from better(823,9) than you are(591,10). They have
known her much longer than t(37,8) known me; no wonder if they love
her better. But, whatever(1053,8)their own wishes, i(1529,10)unlikely
(1413,11) have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were(2004,11)very
objectionable? If they(815,8)d him(731,16)they would not try to
part us; if h(108,9)(1596,8)(46,9)succeed. By(1005,11)such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and(1461,8)and me most(1455,8). Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least(459,8)sligh(14,9)(1991,8)in comparison of
what I(1139,8)feel in thinking ill of him or(1272,12). Let me take it
in the best (123,8)n the light in which it(1699,8)understood.”

(1800,9)(402,11)oppose such a wish; and from this time(1898,14)
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs. Bennet still continued t(865,9)and repine at his returning no
more; and though a day seldom passed(260,10)(236,10)did not account
for it clearl(2004,9)seemed little ch(1252,8)her ever considering it
with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she(161,9)(1701,8)herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but(363,8)the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. (552,11)’s best
comfort was, that(651,12) must be down again(787,8)summer.

Mr(635,9)treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one
day, “your(1412,8)is cro(628,8)love, I find. I congratulate her. Next
to being married,(1896,8)likes to be(87,16) a(661,8)now and
then. It is(1488,11)to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane. Now(75,10)ime. Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies(1271,8)country. Let Wickham
be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”

“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
all expect Jane’s good fortune.”

“True(625,8)(686,10); “but it is a (776,8)(487,9)that, whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an (1893,9)ate mother who will
always make the most of it.”

Mr.(359,8)’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on man(1139,9)Longbourn
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole(1459,8)(1626,11)had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased(1044,10)how much they had always disliked(171,10) before they
had known anything(1531,8)matter.

Miss(2012,8)was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstanc(1005,11)ase unknown to the(643,9)of
Hertfordshire: her mild and steady candour(251,8)pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possi(1782,10)mistakes; but by(377,11)else
(327,10)was condemned as the worst of men.

CHAPTER XXV.(34,19)After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.
Collins was call(647,10)s amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday. The pain of separation, however,(489,11)lleviated on his
side by pr(57,9)s for the reception of his bride, as(834,8)reason to
hope, that shortly after his next return into (558,13), the day
would be fix(1047,8)was to make him the happie(458,10) He took leave
of his relations at(1208,10) with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.

On the following Monday, Mrs(1672,8) had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at
(1496,9). Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior(1530,8)sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view(714,8)own warehouses, c(109,10)been so
well-bred and agreeable. Mrs(289,10), who was several years younger
than(463,13)and Mrs. Philips, was an(1013,8), intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with her(742,11)nieces. Between the two
eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.
T(1738,8)frequently been staying(149,10)in town.

The first part of(332,14)’s business, on her(1266,8), was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
(938,16)many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. T(2027,8)all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.

“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane(949,12)got Mr.
Bingley if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think
that she might(939,11)Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in th(148,8)room,
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and th(1729,13)estate is just as
much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,
(589,9)hey are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at(562,10) is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of
long sleeves.”

(1597,15)to whom the chief of this new(970,11)given before, in
the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondenc(1573,10),(740,9)
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.

When alone with(146,10) afterwards, she spoke more(1193,8)subject.
“It seems likely(506,9)been a desirable match (1152,8),” said she. “I
(680,9)it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,
such as you(1635,10)Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty
girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them(95,11)
forgets her, tha(200,8)sort of inconstanci(1012,12)(1955,8).”

[Illustration:

     “Offended two or three young ladies”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

“An excellent consolation in its way(424,8)(687,9); “but it will not
do for _us_. We(1672,8)suffer by(304,9). It does not often happen
(291,8) interfer(1434,8)friends will persuade a(503,10) of
independent fortune(1680,9) no more of a girl whom he was violently in
(524,10)only a few days before.”

“But that expression of ‘(74,12) love’ is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it giv(1414,11)little idea. It is as
often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s
acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_
(858,11)’s love?”

“I never saw a more promising inclination;(387,8)growing quite
inattentive to other(1797,9)and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
o(871,33) by not asking them to dance; and I
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very ess(833,8)(408,9)Oh, yes! of that kind(34,8) which I suppose him(1990,9)felt. Poor
Jane! I (1456,9)for her, because,(1727,9) disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would
be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a(958,8)relief from home may be as useful as
anything.”

(1932,10)was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt(1320,9)d
of her sister’s ready acquiescence.

“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to
this(1430,11)will influence her. We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are(53,13), and,(2030,8)well know, we go
out so littl(1372,11)is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.”

“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr. Darcy would(1726,9)suffer(919,8)call on Jane in such a
part of London! My dear aunt, how could(770,11)of it?(118,11)may,
perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he(923,9)rdly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, (1694,11)
never stirs(1402,9)him.”

“So much the better. I hope they will not(541,12)(1099,8)es not Jane
correspond with his sister? _She_(74,10)be able to help calling.”

“She will drop the (1966,12) entirely.”

But, in spite of the certainty in which (1101,10)affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of(2041,11)being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not(1170,9) it(283,9)
hopeless. It was (910,8), and sometimes she thought it (1043,8), that
his affection(1517,10)re-animated, and the(1257,11)of his friends
successfully combated by the more natura(1324,12)of Jane’s
attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invit(1436,11)pleasure;(167,8)
Bingleys were no otherwise in her(271,8)s at the same time than as she
hoped, by Caroline’s not living(1255,8)same house with her brother, she
might occasionally spend a morning(57,9),(953,9)any danger of
seeing him.

The(1720,9)s stayed a week at Longbourn; and what(1864,8)e Philipses,
the Lucases(483,10)officers, there was not a day(1110,9)its
engagement. Mrs.(436,8)had so carefully provided for the entertainment(1980,8)brother and sister, that they(778,9)once sit down to a family
dinner. When the (160,10) was for home, som(1096,9)(239,8) always
made(1959,8) it, of which(42,10)Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these(501,9)s Mrs.(438,9), rendered suspicious by(1221,10)’s
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing
them, from w(1115,8)saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plai(1758,12)make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to(1467,11)(1327,15)before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprud(1194,8)encouraging such
an attachment.

To(415,16)(481,8)had one means of affording(1144,9),
unconnecte(1813,11)general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a(1545,9)able time in that very part
of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
(1927,13)in common; and, though(285,13)been(492,8)there since
the death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intellig(1674,9)er former(1681,8) than(318,9)been
in the way of procuring.

(922,13) had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible
(754,8)of discourse. In comparing her recollec(1039,8)(165,9) with
the minute description whic(439,10)could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise(919,8)(232,10)of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself. On being made (629,8)(832,8)the
(982,8)(361,9)’s treatment(1290,9)she tried to remember something of
that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might
agree with it; and was confident, at last, t(1378,8)(427,9)ed having
heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,
ill-natured boy.

     “Will you come and see me?”

CHAPTER XXVI.(71,16)](790,15)’s caution(1455,14)was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking(1475,8)alone: after
honestly tell(776,8)(1736,9)thought, she thus went on:--

“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall(1785,8) merely because you
are warned against(520,8)(1346,13)I am not afraid(219,12)
openly. S(1897,8), I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to(34,8) him, in an affec(1024,11)the want of
fortune would make so very(1852,9)t. I have nothing to say(258,8)
_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the (129,8)he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure. You (171,9)disappoin(178,9)ther.”

“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”

“Yes, and I hope to engage(203,8)be(55,9)likewise.”

“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr.(1644,9)too. He shall(85,8)(873,8)with me, if I
can prevent it.”

“(1129,9), you are not(253,9)now.”

“I beg your pardon(167,10)ry again. At (1619,8)(935,9)(137,12)
(183,11); no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all(1956,8)son,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--(782,10)becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he(813,8)not. I see the(965,9)ce
of it. Oh, _that_ abominable(1886,10)! My father’s opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and(947,10)be miserable to forfeit it. My
father, however, is partial to(569,12). In short, m(776,13)I
(108,10)very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see, every day, that where there is(1356,11)young people are
seldom withheld, by immediat(1393,9)(1264,8), from entering into
engagements with each o(300,9) can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that
it w(462,8)wiser to resist? All that I can(148,9)you(1802,13)is
not to be in a hurry(1088,9)(1034,10)a hu(449,9)lieve myself his
first object. When I am in company with him,(92,15)wishing. In
short(33,9)do my best.”

“Perhaps(868,12)as well if you discourage his coming her(1846,9)
often. At least you(923,11) _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”

“As I did the other day,” said (1297,11)with a conscious smile; “very
true,(1078,12)wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
(1125,8)is always(245,9)often. It is on your account(1180,9)has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the
necessity of constant(520,9)for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour(559,9)try to do what I think(870,11)st; and now(1884,8)you
are satisfied.”

Her aunt assured h(1447,8)she was; an(452,13)having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point without being resented.

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the
Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His
marriage was now fast approaching; and(415,8) at length so far resigned
(644,8)ink it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured
tone,(533,10)“_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was(1763,10)
wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and
when she rose to take leave,(1130,12)ashamed(650,8)(927,8)
ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,
Charlotte said,--

“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”

“_That_ you certainly shall.”

“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?”

“We shall often meet, I hope, in(869,14).”

“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me(1935,13)to
come to Hunsford.”

(1615,9) c(1706,9)refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

“My father and Maria are to (126,8)me in March,” added (446,9), “and
(1380,10) will consent to be(540,8)party. Indeed, Eliza,(52,10)be
as wel(121,11)as ei(1913,8)them.”

The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door(1047,9)rybody had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.(2031,10) soon heard from(1769,11), and their
correspondence was as regular and(1926,9) as it ever(1468,9): that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible(165,12)could never
address her(1644,9)feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;
and(651,9)determined not to slacken as a (253,12)t, it was for the
sake of wha(1710,11)rather than what was.(657,10)’s first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness: there(858,11)but be
curiosity to know how she would speak(2039,8)new home,(37,14)
like Lady Catherine, and how happy(82,11)dare pronounce(1403,8) to
be; though, when the(237,8) were rea(863,8)beth felt that(951,10)
express(1494,10) on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surround(373,8)comforts, and mentioned nothing
which sh(383,12)praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and(385,15)’s behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of(1447,9) and
Rosings rationally softened; and(1065,11)perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there,(650,9)the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines(275,8)sister, to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote agai(1929,8)beth hoped it
w(1166,8)in her power(1352,8)something(1562,8)Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter(1319,8)well rewarded as(58,11)
generally is. (283,9)been a week in town,(1262,9)either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by suppos(1338,8)

los(1974,8)aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”

S(526,14)(1172,10)visit was paid, and she had seen Miss(507,8).
“I did not think(367,9) in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London. I was right, therefore; my(470,13)had never reached her.
I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
engag(1728,8)Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My(464,10)
not long, as(423,10)and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say(626,8)
soon see them here.”

(1721,10)shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
(820,9)only could discover to Mr.(1138,8)(1291,11)’s being(1046,8).

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw(1728,8) of him. She endeavoured to
persuad(1991,11)(1512,8)(754,8)regret it; (720,8)(1798,8) longer be
blind to(826,13)’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet
more, the alteration(43,8)manner, would allow Jane to deceiv(341,9)
(299,9). The(1578,9)hich(1715,11)on this occasion(1808,14)
will prove w(1933,8)felt:--

     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have
     been entirely(274,8)d i(1373,14)’s regard for me. But, my
     dea(773,8), though the event has proved you(1285,8)do(1450,11)me
     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence(2031,8)natural as your suspicion. I(146,8)at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,
     if the same circumstances were to happen again(519,11) I should(426,8)(415,10)again.(1761,10)(1030,10)turn m(1388,8)till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she
     did come, it(1854,9) evident(1187,10)had no pleasure in it;(71,10)made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a
     word of(409,12)see me(344,8)and was, in every respect, so(499,8)tered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance(1427,10). I pity(821,9)I

     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain(1266,8)farther; and
    (1189,8)_we_ know this(115,9)to be quite needless, yet if(767,10)feels it, it will easily account(1769,8)(1183,10) to me; and(628,9)deservedly dear as he is to his(1367,9)whatever(280,9)she may(140,10) on his behalf i(1263,11)nd amiable. I(607,8)but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now(504,10)if he had at all(704,8)red about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of(1621,9)being in tow(1303,8)certain, from something she said(1995,8)(490,11)yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade(97,8) that he is really partial to Miss Darcy(367,10)
     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly,(1547,9) be(1694,8)most tempted to(983,11)there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful(839,12)t, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,(1684,10)the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear
     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said(569,11)of his nev(1122,8)returning to Netherfield(1951,8)of giving up the house, but (487,9)with any(689,8)ty. We had better not mention it. I am extreme(1614,8)glad that you have such pleasant(1129,8)s from our friends at
     Hunsford. Pray go(1816,8)them, with Sir William and Maria. I am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.

“Yours, etc.”

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she
considered that Jane would(1867,10) be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the(1621,9)was now absolutely ov(1910,9)ould not
even wish for any renewal(590,8)attentions. His character sunk on every
review of it; and, as a punishme(1603,8)im, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might(1195,8)soon marry Mr.
Darcy’(1643,10)as, by Wickham’s(1745,8), s(265,9)make him abundantly
regret what(1558,8)thrown away.

Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded(550,11)of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; an(82,12)had
such to send as(284,8)ather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. His apparent(1538,8)ity had subsided,(533,15) were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.(822,11)was watchful enough to
see it all, but she c(1777,8) it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believ(426,9)_she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds(340,9)most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he(1029,9)rendering himself
agreeable; but(1228,10), less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

All this was acknowledged to (1108,13)(1350,8)fter relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I(1390,8)experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and(299,10)all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_, they are even impartial (39,8)Miss King. I cannot find
out (287,9)te her at all, or(27,8)am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My

interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly(531,8)

CHAPTER XXVII.(60,16)]

With no greater events than these(705,8)Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,(469,11)dirty and
(489,10)cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
(1708,9) to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but(1738,10), she soon found, was depending on(439,8)n, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with(403,8)
pleasure(531,12)(431,8)certainty. Absence had increased her desire
of seeing(1936,10) again, and weaken(51,8)isgust of Mr. Collins.
There was novelty(1248,8)scheme; and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a(596,8)change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give
her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however,(1933,8) smoothly,
and was finally settled according to(645,10)’s first sketch. She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of
s(716,8)a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as
perfect as plan could be.

The only pain was in leaving her father, who w(1717,15)miss her,
and who, when it came(1427,8)point, so(1169,8)liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

The farewell between(981,9)and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. His present pursuit(812,11)make him forget that(1287,11)had been the(1272,8)o excite and to deserve his attention, the
(50,9)listen(50,8)pity,(83,14)be admired; and in his manner
of bidd(481,8)adieu, wish(500,8)every enjoyment, remin(50,9)of what
she(1521,8)expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their (22,11)everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard;(1603,9)parted from him convinced, that,
whether married or single, he must(201,8)be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.(1183,13)Lucas,(1190,9)(1183,8) Maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself,(2034,8)hing to say
tha(829,8)be worth hearing(1805,8)re listened to with about as much
delight(1568,8)rattle(329,8)chaise. (899,10)loved absurdities, but
she had known(1452,12)’s too long. H(1816,8)tell her(210,9)new of
the wonders of h(1069,10)ation and knighthood;(1545,9)civilities were
worn out, like his information.

It was a(1880,9)of only twenty-four miles(1556,9)y began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watch(1022,9) arrival: when
they entered the passage, (1128,9)here to welcome them, and(482,10),
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of(1749,8)boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance w(1605,9)allow them to
wait in the(339,13), and whose shyness, as they(877,8) seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented(149,9)ming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopp(994,9)the evening at on(955,9)theatres.
(1857,11)then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her
sister(1479,10)was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though Jane(1705,8)struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to
hope(127,8)ey(585,11)continue long. Mrs(949,10) gav(1556,8)e
particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit(1064,22), and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself(1969,8)proved(221,9) former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.

(251,14)then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.

“But, my dear(1174,11)” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I
sh(1816,8)sorry to think our friend mercenary.”

“Pray(122,10)aunt, what is the(380,9)ce in matrimonial affairs,
(399,8)the(93,10)(936,9)prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid(1838,8)marrying me,
because it w(270,8)imprudent; and now, (40,8)he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
(362,14)If you will(84,8)ll me (471,18)(468,9) is, I shall know
what(471,9).”

“She is a very good kind(548,8), I believe. I know no harm of her.”

“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death
made her mistress of this fortune?”

“No--why should he? If it were(1743,10)able for him to gain _my_
affections(457,10)I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about(1853,9) was equally
poor?(323,8)there seems indelicacy in directing his(334,10)s towards her so
soon after this event.”

“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,
(447,11)_we_?”

“_Her_(44,11)ing(63,10)justify _him_. It only shows her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”

“Well,” cried(1343,11) “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be(936,10), and _sh(30,11) foolish.”

“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_(99,9)I(733,8)(1421,8), you know,
(1432,9)ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”

“Oh, if(136,9)all, I have(1036,8)poor opinion of(100,8)en who live in
(87,10);(1461,8)ir intimate friends(51,12) Hertfordshire are not
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow
where(1269,9)find a(281,13)not one agreeable quality,(316,8)
neither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all.”

“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.
Gardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”

No scheme could have been mor(541,12)to(1042,12)and her
acceptance(342,8)(297,11)was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear
aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me
fresh life and vigour. Adieu to(571,15) and spleen. What are men
to rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! And
when we _do_ return,(443,10)not be like other travellers, without
being (390,8)give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where
we have gone--w(35,9)recollect what (39,8)seen. Lakes,(258,10),
and rivers,(198,14)jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than thos(721,9)generality of(416,11).”

CHAPTER XXVIII.(59,16)]

Every object(1045,8)next day’s journey was new and interesting to
(1972,9);(930,8) spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for(1290,8)
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of(1004,8).

When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search(1533,8)Parsonage, and every turning (1542,9)to bring it in view.
The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side.(1346,10)
smiled at the(899,10)ion of all that(1694,9)heard of its inhabitants.

At length(216,14) was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales (476,8)laurel hedge,
everything declared(1937,11)arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
appear(279,10)door,(110,9)carriage stopp(317,10)small gate, which
led by a short gravel walk(1792,8)house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment(218,12)ll out(1793,8)chaise, rejoicing
(168,8)ight of each other. Mrs(270,10)welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and(1942,10) was more and more satisfied with
coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:
his formal civility was just what it had been(1228,8) detained her some
minutes(839,8)gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. T(683,9)then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness(1590,8)entrance, taken in(634,12); and as soon as(808,10)
in the parlour, he(535,10)them a second time, with ostentatious
formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s
offers of refreshment.
(1636,10) was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good propor(1302,8)the room, its aspect,
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel w(1412,12)lost in refusing him. But though(1281,12)seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at(1082,11),
(1602,9)could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.
(1452,8)said anything of which(563,9) might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly(256,9)seldom, she involuntarily tur(1004,8)eye on
(1577,9). Once or twice(607,11)discern a faint blush; but in general(73,10) wisely di(666,8)ar. After sitting long enough to admire
every article of(639,10) in(682,11)from the sideboard(1909,8)fender, to give an accoun(1610,8)ir journey, and of all that had
happened in London,(1884,13)invit(1078,8)to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, an(188,8) cultivation of

with which (488,10)talked(1955,8)healthful(1458,13)xercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, lead(1214,8)way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. H(1457,9)umber the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. But(740,10)e view(171,8)(571,10), or which
the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with
the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening(990,8)(217,8)at
borde(661,8)park nearly opposite the front(753,8)house. It was a
handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.

but the ladies, not having shoes to encoun(649,8)remains of a white

took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s
help(421,9)rather small, but well buil(2019,8)nvenient; and everything
was fitted up and arrang(1983,8)a neatness(74,8)sistency,(1896,9)

forgotten,(915,8)as really a great air of comfort through(1537,9)by(1927,10)’s evident enjoyment of it,(1459,11)supposed he must be often(143,10).

She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was sti(1732,9)(1029,8). It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, w(300,16)joining
in, observed,--

“Yes, Miss(1679,10), you will(613,10)honour of seeing(190,15)
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say(112,9)
be delight(581,8)her. She is all affability(671,8)descens(1457,9)I
doubt not but(205,10)b(199,8)(673,8)some portion of her notice when
service is over. I have(1756,11)ny hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my(1029,8)Maria(1659,10)inv(76,8)(2032,11)she
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear(851,11)is
charming. We dine at(1565,8) twice(2009,8)eek, and are never allowed to
walk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly (1613,8)for us. I
_should_ say, one(386,8)(76,19)s, for she has several.”

“(838,15)is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added(1020,10), “and a most attentive neighbour.”

“Very true,(357,8), that is exactly what I say(703,9)the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling(1097,9)at had been(1195,9)written(1770,8)en it closed,(1462,10),(1198,8)solitud(454,9)chamber, had to meditate upon(1389,13)degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with,(1786,12), and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. (1472,10)so to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet te(1334,8)their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of(1777,12), and the gaieties(89,10)intercourse
with(979,8). A lively imagination soon settled it all.

About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after(1649,10)opened
the door, and met(1461,10)the landing-place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,--

     “In Convers(1547,11)the ladies”

“Oh(1183,9) Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
haste,(113,10)down this moment.”
(1109,10) asked questions in vain; Maria would tell(1971,8)hing more;
and(94,8)ey ran(221,21) which fronted(458,8)e, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.

“And is this all?” cried (1358,9). “I expected at least that the pigs
were got(437,10)garden, and (431,8)(277,8)but (1828,15)and her
daughter!”

“La!(1741,9)” said Maria, quite shocked a(1058,8)stake, “it is not Lady
(1931,9). The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives(738,9)m. The
other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at(937,10)is quite a little
creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”

“She is abominably rude to keep (1730,9) out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not(881,8)?”

“Oh,(74,11)says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
when(301,15) comes in.”

“I like her appearance(488,8)(1997,11)struck with other ideas. “She

CHAPTER XXIX.(137,16)](758,13)’s triumph, in consequence (1683,8)invitat(678,8) complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to (1770,10)ing
visitors, and of(399,14)see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it sh(1457,8)given so soon was such an instance of(1679,15)’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

“I confess(1814,8)he, “that I(147,8)not have been at all surprised by
her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening
(732,10). I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that
it(1813,9)ppen. But who c(1835,10)foreseen(348,9)attention as this?
W(51,14)imagined that we(435,8)receive an(699,11) to dine
there ((29,13), moreover, includ(710,8)(1022,11)) so
immediately after your arrival?”

“I am the less(408,11)at what has happened,” replie(1580,14)
“from that(351,14)w(1174,8)manners(1535,13) really ar(1263,9)my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
(743,8)s of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”

Scarcely anything was talked(1715,8)whole day or next morning but their
visit to(649,10)(1969,12)was carefully instruc(1480,10)in what
they were to expect,(1504,10)sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.

When(1823,12)were separating for the toilette, he said to
Elizabeth,--

“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.(1192,15) is far from requiring that eleg(1246,8)dress in us which
becomes her(1414,9)daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for(615,10)more. (1891,14) will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.”

While (632,10)dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as(242,16)very much
objected to be kept wai(632,9)her dinner. Such formidable accounts of(1619,13), and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her
introduction (1699,10) with as much appreh(1915,12)r father had done
to his presenta(80,8)St. James’s.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and(1031,10) saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as(1355,13)(2007,8) the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumera(791,8)the windows in front of the
house, and his rel(55,9)(1763,9)glazing altoge(444,9)originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh(1395,11)y ascend(218,8)tep(874,8) hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment
increasing, and even(1964,12) did not look perfectly calm.(1469,10)’s courage(49,9)fail her. She had heard nothing of(1452,16)that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she
thought(599,11)witness without trepidation.

From the entranc(364,8)of which(1990,13)pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the(1989,9) through an antechambe(1635,10)oom where(1600,15),
her(1756,9), and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. H(1324,13)with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs(928,10)had settled it
with her husband t(822,8)office of (1321,13)should be hers, it was
performed in a prop(1494,9),(477,9)any of those apologies and thanks
which he would(1834,8)ought necessary.

In spite of having bee(1400,16),(865,13)was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just(901,8)
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat(745,9)saying a word;
(1218,8)(542,10)(1787,11)almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. (1547,10)found herself
quite equal(1251,8)scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.(778,15) was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
conciliating, nor was h(673,9) of receiving them such as(472,9)her
visitors forget their inferior rank. She(120,8) rendered formidable by
silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as
marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to(1623,13)mind; and, f(1399,8)observ(1930,13)day(1866,11), she
believed(486,16)to be exactly w(840,11)represented.

When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
(1442,10)(1704,10)almost have joined in(2036,10)stonishment at her
being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between th(874,8). Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her(831,11)though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to(1737,15)(434,11)appearance
t(247,10)othing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what(820,9), and placing a screen in the(1677,8)direction before
(503,8).

After(1912,8) a few minutes, they were all sent to one(787,8)windows to
admire the view, Mr(1916,10)attend(1124,9)to point out its beauties,
an(844,17)kindly inform(68,10)hat it was much better worth
looking at(268,8)summer.

The dinner was exceedingly(1353,9), and there(255,10)the servants,
and(22,9)articles of plate which(258,13)had promise(1132,8)as he
had likewise foretold, he took(1854,10)at the bottom(1171,8)table, by
her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that lif(998,8)furnish
(671,8)greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;
and every dish was commended first by him(364,9)n by Sir William, who
was now enough recovered to echo(1607,10)his son-in-law said, in a
manner which(2043,11)wonder(1468,18)could bear. But Lady
(1985,10)seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most
gracious smiles, especially when any dish on(483,10) proved a novelty
to them. The party did not supply much conversation.(252,12)as ready
to speak whenever(760,8)as an opening, but she was seated(1434,8)
Charlotte and(1436,15)--the former of whom was(1247,11)

Wh(1832,13) returned to the drawing-room,(488,11)little to be
done but to hear(1423,16)talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, deliver(332,8)opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as(784,8)t(1804,8)was not used to have
her judgment controverted. She inquired into (709,9)’s domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely(990,11)her a great deal of advice as
to the managemen(496,8)m all; told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry(1060,12)found that(630,9)was
beneath this great lady’s attention which(1626,14) her with an
occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals(181,8)discourse with
Mrs(1892,9), she addressed a variety of(856,9)s to Maria and
(1550,9), but(1421,12)to(1143,11), of whose connections she knew
the least, and who, she observed to (171,14)was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She ask(458,8)t different times how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself(49,10)any of
them were likely to be marrie(96,21)handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kep(324,9)at (59,9)her
mother’s maiden name?(688,12)elt all the impertinenc(753,8)
(516,9), but answered them very composedly.(1271,17)hen
(464,8),--

“You(185,8)’s estate is entailed on Mr(672,11)I think? For your
sake,” tur(1792,8)(1869,9), “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no(847,14)entailing estates from the female line. It(1334,9)thought
necessary in Sir Lewi(1997,11)’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?”

“A little.”

“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy(1662,9)you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it
some da(196,9)r(825,8)(205,14)?”

“One(1449,9)does.”

“Why(1931,8) you all learn? You ought all(1672,8) learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and thei(776,9)has not so good an income as yours. Do
you draw?”

“No, not at all.”

“What, none of you?”

“Not one.”

“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”

“My mother w(83,10)no objection, but my(300,10)tes London.”

“Has your governess left(256,9)We never had any(40,10).”

“No(57,10)! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a(78,12)I(122,8)eard of such a thing(338,13) must
have been quite a slave to your education.”
(1741,10) could hardly help smiling, as she assured her t(1387,8)not
been the case.

“Then who taught you? who attended to you? W(242,18), you(203,16)neglected.”

“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
read, and had(1607,9)masters that were (1316,9). Those who chose to be
idle certainly might.”

“Ay, no doubt: but that is wha(552,13) will prevent; and if I had
known y(891,10), I (894,12)advised her most strenuously to engage
one. I(268,8)say that nothing is to be done i(1981,8)ion (729,8)steady
and regular instruction, and nobody b(776,14) can give it. It is
wonderful how many(519,9) I (776,10)(464,9) of supplying in that
way. I am(486,8)glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and

calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady
Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given m(59,13)’ Are any of your
younge(1979,10)out, Miss Bennet?”

“Yes, ma’am,(1810,9)All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The(129,9)ones out before the elder are married! Your (181,16)must
be very young(183,11)y youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company. But really(274,9)I think it would (138,8)hard upon(358,17)that they(1137,8)not have their share of society and
amusement, becaus(293,12)may(69,13)(987,8)r inclination to
marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!(301,17)
not(305,9)likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”

“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”

“With three(666,17)grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your
(170,8) can hardly expect me to own it.”

Lady (1026,9) seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
an(146,11) suspected herself to be(489,10) creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal(401,9).”

“I am not one-and-twenty.”

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed. (396,14), Sir William, and Mr. and(1575,13) sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting(1925,16)to make up her
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syll(46,8)
uttered that did not relate(1097,8)game, except when(152,15)
expressed her fears of(273,15)’s being too hot or too cold, or
hav(31,8)much(32,8)little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table(486,16) was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of(895,8). Mr(563,9)
was employed in agreeing to everything(1269,13) said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.
(742,11)(491,9)say much. He was storing his memory with(235,9)s
and noble names.

When(366,16)and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up(974,9)riage was offered to(932,13),
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
round(1837,8)e to hear(594,16)determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. From these instructions(57,10) summoned by the
arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins’s side,(1208,8)many bows on(1289,12)’s, they departed. As
soon(440,9)had driven from the door,(1696,11)was called on by her
cousin to give he(2011,10)of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But
her commendation, though cost(927,8)some trouble, could by no means
satisfy(1022,12), and he was very soon obliged to take(1021,13)’s
praise into his own hands.

CHAPTER XXX.(34,19)(1015,12)stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his(995,9)(1507,9)most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and(19,8)neighbour as were not
often met with. While(1989,12) was with them,(1427,12) devoted his
mornings to driving him out in his gig, and show(32,8)the country: but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and(829,15)(971,8) to find that they(1477,10)ee mor(1671,8)(863,8)by the alteration; for the chief(1102,8)time between breakfast
and dinner was now(1901,8)by him either at work in the garden, or in
reading and writing, and looking out of window(373,8)own book room,
which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
(1174,10)at first had rather wondered that(1112,10) should not prefer
the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her frie(58,8)n excellent
reason for w(1334,8)did, for(762,13)would undoubtedly have been
much less(387,12)apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave(319,11)credit(634,9)arrangement.

(1802,8) drawing-room they could distinguish nothing(617,8)lane, and
were indebted to(1008,13)(755,8)knowledge of what carriages went
alo(669,8)how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton(686,8)he never failed coming to inform them of(1645,9)it happened
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage(611,9)
a few minutes’ conversation with(1855,10), but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.

Very few days(1051,8)(906,9)(1395,13)id not walk to(1992,10)and
not many(965,10)his wife(1248,9)think it necessary to go likewise;
and till(1341,11)recollect(979,8)there might be other(1437,8)livings
to be disposed of, she c(1027,9)understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and(755,9)escaped her observation that was pass(796,11)room during
these visits. She examined in(1676,9)(1670,12) look(600,9)ir work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault(1924,9)(1015,12)
of the furniture, or det(427,8)e housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed(158,10)only(1786,9)sake of finding
out that Mrs(1323,9)’s joints of meat were too large for (574,10).
(1627,11)soon perceived,(1967,8)ough this great lady was not in the
commission(1947,8)peace(1974,10)ounty, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the(1032,8)t concerns of which were carried to her by
(1599,11); and whenever any(165,8)cottagers wer(829,11)to be
quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth(670,9)

them into harmony and plenty.

The entertainment of dining at(1264,8) was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing(1843,9)loss of Sir William,(1113,8)re being only one
card-table(1833,8)evening, every such(174,15)was(609,10)erpar(934,10)irst. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living(1005,8)neighbourhood in general was beyond the(1974,8)es’ reach. This,
however, was no evil to(1519,10), and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant(1849,18)
(1849,11)(1548,8)weather was so fin(955,10)time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk,(911,8)re
she frequently went while the oth(924,9)calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edg(1864,8)side(1185,9)ark, where(327,8)as
a nice sheltered path, which no one(1446,11)value but herself, and
where she felt(549,12)reach of(196,15)’s curiosity.

In this quiet way(720,10) fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching(500,12)ek preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family(1047,11)(280,8)in so small a circle must be

was exp(1898,9)r(1061,9)course of a few weeks; and(1725,10)(806,8)
not many(318,8)acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look a(1824,8)ir(1354,9)parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by(863,18)ho talked of(267,13)ith the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms(1915,8)highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been(1091,12)seen by
Miss Lucas and(928,8).

His(613,8) was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr.(1501,8) was walking
(1453,10)morn(273,8)in view(1126,8)lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have(1998,18)“The gentlemen accompanied him.”

the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow(1825,8)carriage
turned into(1355,11)hurried home(540,15) intelligence. On the
following(321,9)he hastened to(820,9)to pay his respects. T(981,10)two nephews(1372,18) to require them,(469,9)Darcy had brought
with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son(784,8)uncle, Lord ----;
and,(1335,8)great surprise of all(1667,8)ty, when(614,13)returned,
t(505,29) (1995,9) had seen them from her
husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately run(683,10)the
other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--

“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.(419,11)would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.”

(1641,14)scarcely time to disclaim all right(1763,8)compliment
before their(1858,9) was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the thre(967,12)entered the room.(628,21)
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly (601,11)an(364,12)looked just as(1390,8)been
used(1756,9)in Hertfordshire, paid(1834,8)pliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs(1370,9); and whatever(1813,10)his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appea(1243,9)composure. (535,10)merely
courtesied to him, without saying a word.

readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and(1902,8)very pleasantly; but
(2000,12)after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden(392,16), sat for some time(275,10)peaking to anybody.
At length, however, his(968,9) was so far awakened as to inquire of(945,11)after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
way(1737,13)a moment’s pause, added,--

“My eldest sister has been in town thes(953,8)months. Have you never
happ(1712,8)see her there?”

She was perfectly sensible that he (1238,8)d: but she wish(81,9)
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he(1024,8)a little confused as he
(379,9)(192,8)had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
subject was pursued no further, and(1189,12)en soon (1364,11)went
away.

CHAPTER XXXI.(50,16)](995,21)’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
(186,8)ladies all felt(498,9)must add considerably(1665,8)pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings. It was some days(896,11)(1723,10)y
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week(999,11)(1809,9)’s arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attentio(1332,8)hen(50,11)merely asked on leaving church to
com(243,8)in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter(2014,21) had called
(585,16) more than once during the ti(2024,8)(1976,10)(162,8)
only seen at church.

The(510,12)was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in(243,15)’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship (649,9)them
civilly, but(567,8)plain(507,9)ir company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody els(1256,11)was, in fact(658,9)engrossed by her nephews,(1777,13)them, especially to Darcy,
much(430,11)to any other person(1701,8)room.(1129,21) seemed really gla(1618,9)them: anything was a
welcome relief to him(1056,11); and(2010,13)’s pretty friend had,
moreover, caught his fancy(1260,10). He now seated himself by (1451,8)
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth(1664,16)half so
well entertained (602,8)room before;(1637,8)y conversed with so much
spirit and flow as to draw the(1155,10) of(1023,16)herself, as
well as of(945,10). _His_ eyes had(1855,8)on and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity(211,8)at (1171,8)ship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,--

“What is that you are saying,(1883,12)? (42,8)i(40,10)talking
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”

“We we(81,10) of(576,8)madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.

“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my sha(1662,10)conversation, if(316,10)(1158,8)(196,8).
There are few people in England, I suppose, who hav(1616,8)rue
enjoyment(279,9) than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever
learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her
health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she w(119,9)
performed(368,8)fully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”

(1864,10)spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s(223,10)cy.

“I am ver(1474,10)hear such a good account of her(649,8)Lady
(1866,9); “and pray tell her from me,(253,10)cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise(405,9)deal.”

“I assure you(795,10)he replied, “(363,9)(79,9)need such advice.
She(101,9)s very constantly.”

“So much the better. It(194,8)be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any(368,8). I often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
(227,8) practice. I have told(1195,12) several tim(112,9)she will
never play(2047,8)well, unless s(349,13)m(1721,11)ough Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as(171,8)often told
her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
Jenkinson’s room. S(936,9)be in nobody’s way, you know,(1955,9)part
of the house.(930,13)looked a little ashamed(923,8)aunt’s ill-breeding, and made
no answer.

When coffee was over, Colonel(1707,12) reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the(423,11). He
drew a chair near her. Lady (1051,9) listened to half a so(228,8)then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards(534,15),
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair (1489,8)r’s
countenance.(390,11)saw what he was do(495,9)at the first
convenient pause tur(324,8)im with an arch smile, and said,--

“You mean to frighten me, (1594,9), by coming in all this state(1546,8)
me. But I will not be alarmed,(980,8)your sister _does_ play so well.
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be(190,9)ed at

intimidate me.”

“(1438,8)not say that you are mistaken(1639,16)because you could
not(1296,8)believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know,(188,9)
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,
are not your own.”

(1111,10)laughed heartily at this picture of herself(675,10) to
(1207,19), “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you(1882,8)(388,8)a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
in meet(1080,9)a person(709,8) able to expose my real character, in a
part(1047,8)world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit. Indeed(956,13)it(1829,9)ungenerous in you to mention
all(720,10)knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out as will shock your relations(1165,8).”

“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.

“Pray let me hear w(989,8)have to accuse him of,” cried(1878,8)
(1878,11). “I should like(885,8) how he behaves among strangers.”

“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The
first time of my ever seeing him(454,17), you must know, was at
a ball--(1653,9)is ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four
dances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was.(67,27)(1607,9)gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more
than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.(1809,11)
you cannot deny the fact.”

“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.”

“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well,(686,20)(462,10)I play next? My fingers wai(1494,8)rd(681,8)Perhaps(848,8)Darcy,(761,11)have judged better had I sought an
(174,8)tion, but I am ill-qualified to recommend(1287,8)to(822,15)Shall we ask y(1563,11)the reason of this?” said (1690,9), still
addressing(980,8)(1651,12). (101,14)him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived(487,8)world, is(238,27)
him(239,17)?”

“I can answer your question(1247,8)(1837,14)without applying to
him. It is because he will not give (129,9)he trouble.”

“I(863,8)ly have not the talent which some people posses(558,15)
“of conversing easily with those I have n(1218,8)n before. I cannot
catch their tone (84,10)ation, or appear interest(392,9)ir
concerns, as I often see done.”

“(778,10)(1597,8)(572,11)“do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. The(349,15)same
force or rapidity, and do not produce(47,9) expression. But then I
have always supposed it to be(1140,8)fault--(542,8)I would not take
(534,11) of practising(600,8)not that I(160,8)believe _my_(1119,8)
as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”

Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. Y(1998,8)employed your
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. We neither of us perform(1222,17)Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what(69,11)talking of.(1266,10) immediately began playing again.
(109,14) approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy,--

“Miss Bennet(588,11)play at all amiss if she(593,8)ed more, and
c(1628,10)the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste(701,8)equal to Anne’s. Anne w(1760,9)
been a delightful(477,8)er, had her health allowed her to learn.”

(407,10)looked at(1870,8)to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin’s praise: but(629,9)at that moment nor at(871,11)could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might(351,11)just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.
(711,16)continued her remarks on(1488,10)’(926,9)ance, mixing
with them many instructions on(1173,10) and taste(878,12)received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remaine(41,9)(1652,11)till her Ladyship’s carriage was
ready to take them all home.

CHAPTER XXXII.(36,19)(1121,10)was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring(350,8)door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she had heard no(337,9), she thought it not un(688,10)be(1361,15); and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter, that s(821,9)escape all impertinent questions,
when(248,9) opened, and to her very great surprise Mr.(1170,8)and Mr.
Darcy only, entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his
intrusion, by lett(56,8)know(1073,9)had understood(860,9)ladies to
be within.

They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency
recollecting _when_(675,9)seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what h(1766,8)say on the subjec(1160,8)ir hasty
departure, she observed,--

“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,(631,10)!
It must have been a most agreeable(686,10)to Mr.(1624,8)(1860,8)you
all after him so soon; for, if I (340,9) right, he went but the day
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”

“Perfectly so, I thank you.”

She found(994,10)was to(1613,8) no other answer; and, after a short
pause, add(400,8)I think I have(822,12)that(312,13)has not much idea of ever
returning to(448,13)again?”

“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable(2046,10)ay spend
very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when(42,8) and engagements are continually
increasing.”

“If he means to be but(167,8)at(720,12), it would be better for the
neighbourh(382,9)he should give up the place entirely,(65,8)n we
might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps,(801,13)did
not take the house so much(177,8) convenience o(1995,8)(196,12)as
for his (1366,10)e must expect him to keep or quit it(1121,9)ame
principle.”

“I(274,8)not b(997,10)d,” said(1687,8)“if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.”

Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking lo(1537,8)his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of(1839,9)a(1409,9)to him.

He took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford.”

“(78,9) she did--and I am sure she c(490,9)have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.”

“Mr. (143,8)appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”

“Yes, indeed; his(1061,9)may well rejoic(70,9)having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. M(1254,8) has an excellent(1488,8)anding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying (323,13)s the wisest
thing she ever did. She seems p(1744,9)happy, howev(1690,9)in a
prudential light, it is(153,8)ly(673,8)good match for her.”

“It must be very(2046,11)to her to be(1282,9)within so easy a
distance of her own(1319,8)and(1597,8).”

“An easy (51,9)do you call it? It is nearly fifty mile(62,8)d what is(28,12) of good road? Little more than half a day’s
journey. Yes, I(122,8)(964,8)(158,13)(1325,15)ever have(484,9)ed the(206,10)as on(1481,9)_advantages_
of the match,” cried (1308,9). (104,21)said Mrs(895,9)
was(1675,9)_near_ her family(462,8)is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond(877,10)(1875,14)of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”

As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which(268,10) fancied she
understood; he(680,9)supposing(672,11)thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--

“I do not mean to say that a woman may(1850,9)ettled too near her
family. The far and the near(874,9)relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. Wher(330,8)is fortune to make the expense of
travelling unimportant,(892,10)becomes no evil. But that is not the
case _here_. Mr. an(659,14) have a(1790,12) income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys(1733,11)persuaded my
friend w(1744,9)call herself(781,18) under less than _half_

have a right to such very strong local(908,11). (64,12) have
been always at(882,10).”

(808,10)looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back(244,10), took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--

“Are you pleased with Kent?”

A short dialogue on the subject(1365,8)country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entr(1724,8)Charlotte
and her sister, just returned(267,9)ir walk. The _tête-à-tête_
(404,9) them. (605,10)related the mistake which had occasioned his
intruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,
without saying much to anybody, went away.

[Illustration: “Accompanied by their aunt”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

“What can be the meaning of this?” said(379,10), as soon as he was
gone. “My dear Eliza,(1550,12)in love with you, or he(1067,8)ever
have called on us in this familiar way.”

But when(1682,11)told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to(596,10)’s wishes,(1711,9)e case;(460,12)various
conjectures, they could at last only(1916,8) his visit to proceed from

was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard(1122,8)but(1229,8)en(1311,8)be

separately(22,11) toget(1710,9)now and then a(987,19)
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and(917,11)was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former
favourite,(1253,8)Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw(773,11)less captivating softness in(351,20)’s manners, she
believed he might have the best informed mind.(1232,8)y(1668,11)came so ofte(483,8)(807,10) it was mor(1086,11)

certainly looked at(198,12)a great deal, but the expression(255,8)

(859,8)did not think it right to press the subject,(1924,8)e danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all(754,11)’s dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.

In her kind schemes for(1822,10), she(500,11)planned her marrying
(1996,19). He was, beyond(1744,8)son, the pleasantest man: h(799,12)admired her, and his situ(655,9)life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages,(1735,11)had considerable patronage

CHAPTER XXXIII.(54,16)]

More than once did(411,12)in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet(1979,10). She felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring(1326,8)re no one else was brought; and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,
that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these(1953,9)s it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause(1819,8)n away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
never sai(1680,16)nor did she give(1894,8) the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her (868,8)ourse of their third
encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her
pleasure in being at(1973,9), her love of solitary walks, and(1449,13)of Mr.(1617,9) Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of
Rosing(86,10) not perfectly understanding the house, he(635,8)to
expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
_there_ too. His words(100,10) imply it. Could he have Colonel
(1515,11) in his(625,8)s? She(1659,8)d, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her
a little, and she was quite glad to find(694,9)at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.

She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last
lett(1747,8)dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of(742,8)gain surprised by(1784,10),
she saw, o(1693,12), that(490,8)(2005,12) was meeting her.
Putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--

“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”

“I have been mak(822,8)tour of(1804,10)” he replied, “as I generally
do every year, and intended to close it with a call(575,8)(544,11)Are you go(1262,8) farther?”

“No, I(1859,8)have turned in a moment.”

And accordingly she did turn,(1525,8)y(270,9)owards(684,14)
together.

“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.

“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases.”

“And if not able to please himself(1578,8)arrangement, he has at least
great (1520,12)the power of choice. I do(624,10)anybody who seems
more to enjoy(67,14)doing what he likes than(858,10).”

“H(28,9)o have his own way very well,”(663,8)(881,20).
“But so we all do. It is only(1812,9)has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and (37,11) are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.”

“In my opinion, the(91,12) of an earl can know very little of
either. Now, seriously, what have(1091,10)known of(149,27)? When(56,10)been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose or procuring(1789,9) you had a fancy for?”

“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from the(252,14). Y(517,10)s(150,8)marry
where they like.”

“Unless (27,15) women of fortune, which I think they very often
do.”

“Our habits of expense make us too (618,8)t(1335,9)re are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money.”

“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pra(760,8)is
the usual price(843,11)’s(959,12)? Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”

He answered her(1484,8)same style(1756,9) subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with(1038,8)d passed,
she soon afterwards said,--

“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody(1830,18)I wonder he(1895,10)marry, to secure a
lasting convenience(982,9)kind. But,(1061,8), his sister does as well
(161,8)present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do(1783,8)
likes with her.”

“No,” sai(1738,21), “that is an advantag(452,8)he must
divide with me. I am join(454,8)him(2003,8)guardianship of Miss(1919,11)Are you, indeed? (801,8) what sort of a(72,9) do you make? Does
your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes
a(1711,8)difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.”

As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly;(891,9)manner
in(409,10)immediately asked her why she(1040,8)d(383,11) likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near(289,8)th. She directly replied,--

“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say(793,8)one of the most tractable creatures(1237,8)world. She is a
very great favourite with some(574,11)my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley.(1825,9)I(524,8)ard you say that you know them.”

“I(16,10) (662,8). Thei(1526,12) a pleasant, gentlemanlike
man--he is a(212,8)riend of Darcy’s.”

“Oh yes(1043,8)(1801,9) drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”

“C(16,10)! Yes, I really believ(861,8)_does_ take(69,12) in
those points where (507,8)wants care. From something that he told me
in our journey hither,(435,8)reason to think(475,8) very much indebted
to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for(528,8)no right to(1975,8)
that(102,9)was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”

“What is it you mean?”

“It is a circumsta(1949,10)Darcy of course could not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it
would be an un(706,8) thing.”

“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”

“And rememb(1186,8)(345,9)t much(447,8)for supposing it to be(701,8). W(532,14) was merely this:(565,9)congratulated himself
on having lately saved a(888,8)from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but withou(252,13)names or any other
particulars(1308,8)only suspected(243,9)(704,9)from believing him
the kind of young man(471,8)into a scrape of t(1956,8), and from
knowing them(1793,9)been together the whole of last summer.”

“Did (1141,10)(2000,9)his reasons for this interference?”

“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady(603,9)what arts did he use to separate them?”

“He did not talk to me of his own art(1385,9)Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He
only(644,10)(720,13)w told you.”

(1452,10)made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her(1657,9),(174,12) asked her why she
was so thoughtful.

“I am thinking of w(1770,8)(529,11)elling me(1664,8)she. “Your
cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the
judge?(1104,8)are rather disposed to call (587,16) officious?”

“I do not see what right(678,11)had to decide on the propriety of his
friend’s inclination; or why, upon(555,9)judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what mann(1286,8)friend was to be happy. But,”
she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the(1131,12), it is not fair to condemn him. I(31,9)to be(1763,8)d
(926,12)as much affection in the case.”

“Tha(104,9)an unnatural surmis(577,9)(856,11); “but it is
lessening the honour of my (617,9)triumph very sadly.”

This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
(1235,9), that she w(1895,9)trust(377,8) with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly chang(213,8)conversation, t(1024,8) indifferent
matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think(1735,9)interruption
of all(275,10)had heard. It wa(571,20) that(1786,12)eopl(108,8)be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
c(395,9)exist(640,8)world _two_ men over whom(1699,11)could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned(747,8)measures
taken(1635,13)Mr.(1972,9)and Jane,(303,9)never doubted; but she
had always attributed to Miss(79,9)the principal design and
arrangement of them. I(1741,10)vanity, however,(1788,9)mislead him,
_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were(38,12)(537,11)
Jane had suffered, and still(1222,10) to suffer. He had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most(1160,10)ate, generous heart
(539,12); and no on(749,8)say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.

“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel
(1958,11)’s words; and these(81,19)probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another(40,9)in
business in London.

“To Jane(1630,9)” she exclaimed, “ther(967,11)no possibility of
(268,9),--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding
excellent, her mind improv(600,8)her manners captivating. Neither could
anything be urged(417,9)my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which(1120,11)himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will(481,10)never reach.” When she thought
of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little(1133,9) would
not allow(1442,11)(703,10)_there_ had material weight with Mr.
Darcy, whose pride,(1461,12)vinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend’(1545,9)ions than from their want
of sense; and(1600,9)quite decided, at last, t(1511,16)partly
governed by this worst kind of(233,8)and partly by the wish of
retaining(1548,13)for his sister.

The agitation and tear(595,8)the subject occasioned brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see(1847,10), it determined her(2027,8)attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
see(166,8)(591,9)really unwell(1728,10)press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr(142,9)
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather
displeased by her staying at home.

CHAPTER XXXIV.(36,19)When(351,11)gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperat(1503,9) as
much (306,12)(1729,8)(517,11)chose for her employment the
examination of all the lette(726,9)Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communic(178,9)present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a(1230,9)that
cheerfulnes(1586,8)(1140,9)used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding(1273,9) serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed(1051,9)everyone,(1290,10)scarcely ever clouded.(601,10)
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly(1581,8)d on the first perusal.(1904,10)’s
shameful boast of what misery(1503,13)able to inflict gave her a
keener sense of her sister’s(529,10)s. It was some consolation to
think that his visit(1292,11) was to en(214,9)day after the next,
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should(976,9)be
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.

She (1320,10)think of(418,8) leaving Kent without remember(1514,9)his
cousin(298,8)go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
(2007,12)no intentions at(971,9), agreeable as he was, she(1628,8)
mean to be unhappy about him.

While settling this point,(1717,9)suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell; and her spirits were a little flutter(71,10)(862,8)its
being(288,22)imself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularl(708,8)her. But
this idea was soon banished,(229,22)very differently
affected, when,(1575,8)utter amazeme(362,8)saw(1701,10) walk into the
room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquir(212,11)
health, imputing(990,14)a wish of hea(718,10)she were better.
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room(1450,11) was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came(1590,9)her
in an agitat(347,9), and thus began:--

“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings(25,10)be
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you.”

(1740,9)’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubt(728,8)was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of(1393,10)he felt and had long felt for her(711,12)
followed. He spoke well; but there were(353,10)besides those(1172,8)heart to be detail(954,10) was not more eloquent(1960,8)subject of
tendern(1715,9)of pride. His(1898,14)inferiority, of its being a
degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed
to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed du(1825,8)
consequence(265,8)wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.

In spit(258,9)deeply-rooted dislike, s(1881,13)be insensible to
the compliment of such a man’s(1964,10)(914,8)ough her(1812,12)did
not vary for an insta(1737,12)at first sorry for the pain(531,8)to
receive; till(1780,8)to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer(1384,10)patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
representing(1667,8)the strength of that attachment which i(480,10)
all his endeavours he had found impos(468,8) conquer; and with
(1157,8)ng his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. As he said this(614,11)easily see(1149,9)had no doubt of a
favourabl(1745,8). He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance(1380,8)ed real security. Such a circumstanc(781,8)only
exasperate farth(308,9)hen he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks
and she said,(1706,8)such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to(433,8) a(1254,10)obligation(829,9)sentiments avow(725,11)
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that(97,12)should be
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I(583,11)thank you. But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opin(1130,9)you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. It has been(76,8)consciously done(1057,11)and I hope will be
of short duration. Th(1813,11)which you tell me have long prevented
the acknowledg(1410,8)your regard can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation.”

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face,(1758,8)to catch her words with no less(1467,12)than
surprise. His complexion became pale with ang(382,8)the disturb(1165,12)mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling(1659,8)
appearance of composure, and(1302,9)t open his lips till he(962,8)d
himself(629,9)attained it. The paus(1760,8) Elizabeth’s(556,9)
dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness,(1406,8),--

“And this is all the reply which I am(790,9)the honour of expecting! I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so(661,8)_(1688,9)_ at
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”

“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “(139,13)evident a design
of offending and insulting me, you chose to(932,9)that you liked me
(799,8)your will,(818,9)your reas(1204,8)even(30,14)character?
Was not this some excuse for in(308,10)if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own(1174,10)decided(214,12), had they been indifferent, or(30,10)even been(1982,11), do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man who(1423,10)the means of ruining(660,9) for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?”

As she pronounced these words, (1309,9) changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued,--

“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
you cannot deny(786,10)have(417,10)principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice(971,8)tability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involv(159,9)both in misery of the acutest
kind.”

S(1488,8)d, and saw(1773,9)slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any(1579,8) of remorse.
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

“Can you(485,20)done it?” she repeated.

With assumed tranquillity he then(1440,8), (723,8)no wish of denying
that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I(708,10)
kinder than towards myself.”

(1958,9) disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

“(1840,10)not merely this affair,” she (1107,10) “on which my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided. Y(1755,13) was unfolded(1207,8)recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can(1159,10)to
say? In what imaginary act of friendship(57,10)ere defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation(62,14)impose upon others?”

“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,
in a less(858,9) tone, and(982,8)heighten(1699,9).

“Who that knows what his misfortunes(1469,11)can help(1107,9)an
(175,12)him?”

“H(66,14)!”(1033,9) Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his
(123,22)great indeed.”

“And of your infliction,” cried (902,9), with energy; “You have
reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative(21,8). You
have withheld the advantages which you must know to(1806,11)designed
for him. (159,8) deprived the best years of his life of that
independence which was no less his due than his desert(109,12)one
all this! and yet you can treat the mention(134,8)(551,12)with
(472,8) and ridicule(432,9)this(418,9)Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
“is your(1124,12)me! This is the estimation i(1229,8)you hold me! I
thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning(1620,9)her, “these offences might(1677,11)overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
bitter accusation(177,17) suppress(177,8)I, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my
being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
(1938,11) by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the(1352,8)s I related. They were natural and just.
Could you expect me to rejoice(1856,8)inferiority(1315,8)
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose
condi(855,8)life is so decidedly beneath my own?”

(1416,9) felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--

“You are mistaken, Mr.(1669,8)if you suppose th(1253,8)ode(313,9)declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the
concer(1161,8)I(962,12)felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.”

She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continue(302,11)could not have made me the offer(1909,9)hand(262,8)possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it.”

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expr(1224,10)mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--

“From the very beginning, f(25,8)first moment, I may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
(1219,10)your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdai(1487,9)(1114,9)of others, were such as to form that groundwork of
disapprobation, o(1861,8)succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and I(1691,9)known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man(1246,8)world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”

“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your(334,9), and have now only to be(1497,12)what my own(1960,10).
Forgive me for having taken up so much(863,9)time, and(818,8)my best
wishes for your health and happiness.”

And(607,9)se words he hastily left the room, and (1453,10)heard him
the nex(765,8) open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of
her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to suppor(1590,9),
and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her
(1130,12), as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by
every review of it. That she should receive an(1337,10)marriage from
(1675,9)! that (60,10)(567,9) in love with her for so many months!
(572,8)(45,8)as to wish(774,9) her in spite of all the objections
which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which
must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost
incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong
a(1970,8)ion. But his pride, his abominable(22,12)shameless avowal
(980,8)he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in
acknowledging, though he(1908,11)justify (1507,8)the unfeeling manner(424,8)e had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom(197,8)not
at(1947,8)to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his
attachment had for a(1072,8)excited.

She continued in very agitating(900,8)ions till the sound of Lady
Catherine’s c(844,8)made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.

CHAPTER XXXV.(63,16)]

(1395,10)awoke (1391,11)rning to the same thoughts and medita(954,16)at length closed her eyes. S(618,13)yet recover from the
surprise(1735,9)had happened:(908,8)impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge(357,9)in air and exercise. She was proceeding
directl(456,9)favourite walk, when the recollec(727,8)(1436,9)’s
sometimes coming there stopped h(1279,8)instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane which led her farth(402,11) turnpike road. The
park paling was s(813,9)boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.

After walking two or three times along that part of(214,9),(891,8)
tempted, by the pleasantness(50,8)morning, to stop at(154,11)and
look(163,10)park. The five weeks which s(1247,9)w(235,8)in Kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was add(910,10)
verdure(243,8)early tre(871,8)was on the point of(1275,8)ing her
(640,11)she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove
which edged(621,9): he was movi(420,8)way; and fearful of its being
(752,9)(443,9) (828,9)retreating. But the person who advanced was
now near enough to see(804,10)stepping forward with eagerness,
pronounced her name. She had(832,8)away; but on h(1408,21),
though in a voic(875,8)proved it to be(1002,10), she moved again
(1849,8)(807,8). He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out
a letter,(678,11)instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty
composure, “I have been(930,9)in(960,8)ve some time,(732,8)hope of
meeting you. Will you do me the honour of read(574,9)letter?” and
then(168,9)slight bow,(416,9)gain(944,11)lant(1893,11)was soon
out of sight.

With no expecta(1419,8)pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,(1871,11)opened the(381,9)and(2000,8)still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope contain(1289,8)sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. The(97,10)itself was likewise
full. Purs(1077,8) way(1399,9)(1386,12)then began it. It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o’clock(1275,8)(1412,9)(417,8)as follows:--

“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this(747,9)by the apprehension of
its(335,12)any repeti(1914,8)those sentiments, or renewal(32,9)
offers(849,8)were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
inten(618,9)aining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,
which, for the happi(1761,8)both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation(35,8) perus(265,8)(366,9) must occasion,
should(1061,11)spared, had not my character requir(1300,12)(713,8)and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
demand it of your justice.

“Two offences of(883,8)(2022,8)t nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you(592,12)laid to(311,8)ge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of th(722,12) of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
from your sister,--(518,8)other, that I had, in defiance of various
claims(31,17)honour and humanity, rui(1331,8)immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and(65,9)been brought up t(1687,8)
its exertion, would be a depravity, to(965,11)separ(1742,9)two young
persons whose affection c(83,8)the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame(1338,8)as last
(1337,9)liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and
their motives has been read. If,(1719,8)explan(349,10)hem which is due
to(1469,9)I am under the necessity of relating(1175,9) which may be
offensive to yours, I can only say(908,8)am sorry. T(100,13)must
be obeyed, and further apology(588,11)bsurd. I(1456,9)been long in
Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that(1113,9)preferred your elde(1124,8) to(819,10) young woman(369,8)country. But
it was not till the evening(1270,8)dance at Netherfield(1208,11) any
apprehension of his(1567,8) a serious attachment(281,8)often seen him
in lov(273,8). At that ball, while I had the(1282,8)of dancing with
you, I was(1502,8)ade acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental
in(1976,9)(378,14)’s(1799,10)s(587,8)(378,8)had given rise to
a general expect(743,12)ir marriage. He spoke of it as a certain
event, of(1170,11)time alone(1133,10)undecided. From that moment I
observed my friend’s behavi(2013,11)vely; and I could then perceive
that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond w(551,10)ever witnessed
in him. Y(320,11)I also watched. Her look and manners were open,
cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar
regard(243,8)remained convinced,(1414,10)evening’s scrutiny, that
though she received hi(554,13)with pleasure, she did not invite
them by any particip(1651,9)sentiment. If _you_ have(1114,10)mistaken
here, _I_ must have been in an error(375,8)uperior (1955,9) of your
sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I(111,11)misled
by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has(1333,9)
unreasonable. But(1711,9)not scruple to assert, that the serenity of
(937,11)’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most
acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart
(1399,8)likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing
her indifferent is(1079,8); but I will venture to(1770,10)my
investiga(1975,9) decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or
fears. I(723,9)believe her to be(164,13)because I wished it; I
believed it on impartial(353,11), as truly as(64,12) in reason.
My objec(1443,9)the(1386,9) were not merely those which I last night
ac(790,9)d to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside
in my own case; the want of connection coul(316,8) so great an evil to
(1462,9) as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes
which, (1201,8)till existing, and(14,9) to an equal degree in both
instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget,(496,9)they(384,9)
immediately before me. These(197,8)must be stated(184,9)briefly. The
situ(1879,9)your mother’s family(239,9)(534,9)able, was nothing in
comparis(1952,8)at total(430,9)propriety so frequently, so almost
uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younge(1789,8)s, and
occasionally even(53,9)father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend
you. But amidst your concern for the defects(310,9)nearest relations,
and your dis(1724,8) at this represent(1701,9)them, let it give you
consolation to consider(354,8) have conducted yourselves so as to avoid
any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on
you (216,9)eldest sister than it is honourable(1089,8)sense and
disposi(1947,8)both.(1384,8)only say, farther, that from what passed
that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every
inducement heightened, which could have led me(865,8)to preserve my
friend(157,11)I esteemed a most unhappy(1195,11). He left
Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am(1699,8),
remember, with the design of soon returning. The part(1454,9)acted is
now(1857,8)xplained. His(860,8)’ uneasiness had been equally excited
with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike
sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we
shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly
went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to(548,11)the(438,8) evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them
earnestly. But however(1100,8)monstrance might have staggered or delayed
his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have
prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which
I hesitated not in giving,(1677,9)sister’s indifference. He had before
believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,
regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger
dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,
that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade
him against(1027,10) into Hertfordshire, when that conviction(996,9)
given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for
having done thus much. There is but one part of my(1744,8),(867,8)whole
affair, on(1219,9)do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I
condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him
(667,14)being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss
Bingley; but he(1219,9) is even yet ignorant of it. That they might
have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard
did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her(122,9)some
danger. Perhaps this(322,8)ment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is
done,(1255,8), and(324,8)done for the best. On this subject I have
nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your
(1156,9)feelings,(463,8)unknowingly done; and though the motives which
governed me may to you very(1120,8)ly(386,8)insufficient,(152,8)not
yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty
accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by
laying before you(940,10) of his conn(1408,12)my family. Of what he
has _particularly_ accused me I am(774,9); but of the truth of what I
shall relate I can summon more(1416,8)e witness of undoubted veracity.
(253,11) is the son of a very(352,8)able man, who had for many years
the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good(1283,8) in
the discharg(346,9)trus(1686,9)ly inclined my father to be of service
to him; and on George(488,10)who was his godson, his kindness was
(1707,9) liberally bestowed. M(125,9)supported him at school, and
afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as(1857,8) father,
always poor from the extravaganc(647,9)wife, would have been unable to
give him a gentleman’s education(217,12)was not only fond of this
young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging,(2031,8)also the
highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,
int(1770,9)provide(1470,9)in it. As for(1705,9)it is many,(712,12)since I first began to think of(81,8)a very different manner. The
vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to
guard(491,10)knowled(789,10)best friend, could not escape the
observati(977,8)(437,9) of nearly the same age with himself(934,9)
had opportunities of seeing(352,8)unguarded moments(216,8)Mr. Darcy
(163,10)have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you
only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments(135,11)(1255,8)has
created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding
his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father
died about five years ago; and his attachment to(207,13)was to the
last so steady, that in his will he (1659,12) recommended it to me to
promote his advancement in the bes(753,8) that(910,15) might
allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living
might(1008,8)as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of
one thousand pounds. H(1376,13) did not long survive mine; and
within half a yea(1413,10)se events(406,14)rote to inform me
that, having finally resolved against taking(295,9)he hoped I should
not think it unreasonabl(1264,10)to expect some more immediate
pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by(1187,10)(1127,10)be
benefited. He had some intention, he added, of study(1487,8)law, and I
must be aware that the interest of (449,19)(1546,10)a very
insufficient(1937,8) therein. I rather wished than believed(309,8)be
sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his
proposal. I knew that(1150,13)ought not to be a clergyman. The
business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance
in(1850,11), were it possible that(469,10)ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return thre(868,19)All connection
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill(1905,8)to invite him
to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I(495,8), he
chiefly lived, but his(676,17) was a mere pretence; and being
now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and
dissipation. For about thre(1543,8)I heard little of him; but on the
decease(957,8)incumbent(974,8)living(966,8)ad been d(576,8)for him,
he applied to m(1950,8)by letter for(1055,8)sentation. His
circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty i(900,8)ing it,
were exceedingly ba(1118,10)found(410,9)a most unprofitable study,
and was now absolute(1387,12)on being ordained, if I would(221,8)

doubt, as he was well(288,9)that(285,10)other person to provide for,
and I(1412,11)have forgotten my revered father’s(1421,10)s. You will
hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in propor(1113,8)the distress of his (585,13)--and(310,8)doubtless as violent in
his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this
period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he(1093,8)I
know not. But last summer(506,8)again most painfully obtruded on my
notice. I must now mention a(287,13) which(696,9)wish to forget
myself, and which no obligation less than(978,12) should induce me
to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of
your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left
to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and
(512,9)bout a year ago, she was taken from school, and an
establishment form(1346,8)er in London; and(513,13)she went with
the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.
Wickham, undoubtedly by design;(1454,8)re proved to have been a prior
(734,13)(1954,8)him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were
most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far
recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a
strong impression(1110,8)kindness to her as a child, that(505,8)
persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She
was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
imprudence, I am happy to ad(187,8)I owed the knowledge of it to
herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended
(220,9)(655,8)en(411,12)unable to support the idea of grieving
and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,
ac(226,9)d the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I
acted. Regard for m(1165,8)’s credit and feelings prevented any public
exposure; but I wrote to Mr. (922,9)who left the place immediately,
(868,15) was of course removed from her charge.(100,12)’s
chief object was unquestionably(224,13)fortune(650,8)is thirty
thousand pounds(215,8)cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging
(957,8)on me was a (919,8)nducement. His revenge would(1178,10)
complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in
which we(1269,11)concerned together; and if you do not absolutely
reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
towards(540,12). I know not in what manner, under what form of
falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be
wondered at, ignorant as you previously wer(339,10)thing(316,8)ing
either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly
not(43,9)inclination(969,10)possibly wonder why all this was not
told you last night. But I(35,8) then master enough of my(1638,8)know
what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth(287,15)here
related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel
Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and
still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been
unavoidably acquainted with every(212,11) of these transactions. If
your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you
cannot be(1420,11)by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and
(1207,8)re may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour
to find some opportunity of putting this letter(783,9)hands in the
cours(403,9)morning. I will only add, God bless you.

“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”

CHAPTER XXXVI.(36,19)Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it(443,8)well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apolog(84,8)in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded,(84,9)c(1873,10)no explanation to
giv(2047,9)a just sense of sham(1936,8)not conceal(214,8) strong
prejudice against(1288,14) might say, she began his account of
what had happened at Netherfield. S(368,9)ith an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impati(1157,8)knowing
what the next sentenc(197,8)bring, was incapable of attending to the
(324,9)the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s
insen(1157,9)she instantly resolved to be false; and(338,15) the
real, the worst objections(1651,8)match, made her too angry to have any
wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done
which satisfied her; his style(1952,9)penitent, but haughty. It was all
pride and insolence.

But when this subject was succeeded by(296,16)Mr. Wickham--when
(986,8), with somewhat clearer attention, a(1919,9) of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion(1320,8)worth(1183,8)ich
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--h(1205,11)
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, ap(853,10), and even horror, op(533,8)her. She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must(754,9)!
This cannot be! (36,13)the grossest falsehood!”--and when(1671,8)
gone(1562,12) whol(1764,10)though(1503,10)knowing anything(874,8)last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that sh(1376,11)
regard it,(30,17)ever look in it again.

In this perturbed state of min(707,8)thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it(1534,11)do: in half a minute th(300,8)
was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well(1863,8)could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to(964,8), and
commanded(115,9)so far as to examine the meaning of every(1523,9).
The(1362,12)his connection(346,8)e Pemberley family was exactly
(1285,12)(174,8)himself; and the kindness(1585,8)late Mr. Darcy,
(646,8)he had not(1616,8)known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; b(1367,8)she came to
the will, the difference was great. What(1371,8) had said(227,9)iving
was fresh in her memory; and(543,8)recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that ther(149,8)oss duplicity on one side or the
other, and, for a few moments, she flatter(601,11)that her wishes did
not err. (1683,9)(1620,8) and re-(1632,11)the closest(1627,12)the
particulars immediately following of(1725,8)’s resigning all pretensions
to(373,11),(1643,8)receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the
(1370,8)weighed(1807,8)ircumstance with w(1312,8)meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Agai(459,11)on.
But every line proved more clearly(648,9) affair, whic(973,9)
believed it (714,11)that any contrivance could so represent as to
render(1075,10)’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him(1955,9) blameless(1843,8)out(1846,10).

The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled(955,8)lay to
Mr.(729,11)charge exceedingly shocked her;(1578,8)e so,(1621,13)
bring no proof of its injustice. S(1364,8)ever heard of him(1379,8)his
entrance into the ----shire militia, i(317,8)he had engaged at the
persuasion(1511,8)young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,(2036,8) had been(1607,8)n Hertfordshire but (1729,8)told

himself. As to his real character, had information been(1593,8)power,
(1828,9)ever felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and
mann(111,8)established him at once in the posses(469,8)every virtue.
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished
trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the
attacks of(1056,10); or at least, by the predomin(153,8)virtue, atone
for those casual errors, under(1238,11)would endeavour to class what
(1188,9) had described as the idleness and vice of many years’
continuance. But no such(354,10)ion befriended her. S(1042,8) see him
instantly(1000,9)er, in(1681,8)harm of air and address, but(1121,11)remember no more substantial good than the(1287,9)approbat(1034,10)
neighbourhood, and the regard(1325,8)is social powers had gained him in
the mess. After pausing on this point a(2021,14)while, she once
more continu(701,8)ad. But, alas! the stor(1481,8)followed, of his
designs on Miss Darcy, received some confi(972,8)from what had passed
between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only(1542,8)ning before; and at
last she was referred for the truth(960,10)particular to(123,8)
(123,12)himself--from whom(1999,8) previously(237,10)the
(1207,12)of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose
(1292,9)(112,9)no reason to question. At one time(155,9)almost
resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked(1059,8)awkwardness
of the application, and at length wholly banish(69,10)conviction t(1043,14)woul(1932,9)ave hazarded such a proposal, if(1896,8)not been
well assured(357,8)(333,9)corroboration.

She perfectly (967,8)ed everything t(655,14) in conversation(671,9)Wickh(659,15)in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.
Many(531,8)expressions were still fresh(1769,8)memory. She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting(1994,8) forward as(427,8)done(1247,10)inconsistenc(259,9)professions
with his conduct. She(428,12)that(519,8)boasted of having no fear
of seeing(1793,10)--that(1809,10) might leave the country(786,8)at
_he_ should stand his ground; ye(137,9)avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week(213,16), also, that till(73,16)
family had quitted(179,14)he had told his story to no one but
herself;(224,9) after their removal,(520,8)been everywhere discussed;
(387,12)then no reserves, no scruples in sink(392,13)’s(1236,10), though(328,9)ssured her that respect(1464,9)father would
always prevent(846,8)osing the son.

How differently di(1009,13)now appear in(1912,8)e was(1449,8)ed! His
atten(840,9)Miss King were now(1257,8)sequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary;(2045,9)mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moder(1632,13)wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
His behaviour to(1886,9)could now(1428,8)d no tolerable motive: he had
either been d(2033,8)with regard to(207,12), or(613,10)gratifying
his vanity by encourag(464,8)preference which she believed(1935,9)most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and(12,8); and in further justific(2018,9)(1749,9), she(324,9)t
but allow (1155,9)Bingley, when(1990,9)ed by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as
were his manners,(311,9)never,(78,8)whole course of their
acquaintance--an (17,12)(828,8)ad latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy (1547,9)ways--seen(699,9)
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--(756,8) that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued(60,8)even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
bro(283,10)that(724,9)often heard him speak so affectionatel(1873,8)
sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling(235,8)had his
actions been what(196,9)represented them, so gross a viol(1173,8)
(1385,11)right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person(218,12)it and such an(228,9)man
as(891,12) was incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of(1314,8). Of neither Darcy nor(486,8)
could she think, without(364,8)(479,14)been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.

“How despicab(322,8)I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on
my discernment! (45,12)valu(45,12) my abilities!(85,9)
often disdained the generous candour of my sist(1012,9)ratified my
vanity in useless or(1248,10) distrust. How humiliating is this
discovery! Yet, how just a(47,10)on! Had I been in love, I(1443,11)(651,10)more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my
folly. Pleas(1791,8)(1719,15)of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our(1407,13), I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were
concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”

From(808,8) to Jane, from Jane to(1791,10)her thoughts were in a line
which soon(1609,10)o her recollection(1876,10)Darcy’s explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. How (1025,10)deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which(1056,14)obliged to
give(2040,8)other? He declared him(379,8)(1378,10)totally unsuspicious
of her sister’s attachm(274,13)(804,9) help remembering what
Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither(279,18)e justice
of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s(1719,8)s, though
fervent, were little displayed(1879,11)there was a constant
complacency in her air and manner, not often unit(996,8)great
sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. T(377,10)(145,8)charge struck her too forcibly
for denial; and the circumstances to(203,9) particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation,(677,12)ave made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.

The complimen(1132,8)self and(809,11) was not unfelt. It soothed, but
it(822,11)console her for the contempt(508,8)(996,8)thus
self-attract(1567,10)rest of(552,11);(294,8)she considered that
Jane’s disappointment had, in fact,(115,8)e work(92,8)nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, s(987,8)depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every

reconciling(1790,8), as well(423,10)uld, to a change so sudden and so

cheerful as usual(1355,8)e resolu(1453,8)repressing such(565,8)ions as
must make her unfit for conversation.

She was immediately told,(1469,9) two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her(294,8); Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam(1955,10)sitting(332,9)m at least

been in waiting near the lodges, to make them h(181,20), was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligen(1917,9)ir(879,10) in very

she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her
future niece; nor could she think,(138,9)a smile, of what her
(323,8)’s indignation would(127,10). “What w(92,9)have said? how
(25,15)behaved?” were the questions with which she amused
herself.

Their first subject was the dimin(1631,9)the(1511,8)’ party. “I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,” said(685,15); “I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be(88,10)(57,11)me!
They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear
(1708,8)rallied his(1076,9)(1094,8)y till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to(344,9)most acutely--more, I(636,8)than last year. His

“But if that is the case, you must write to your(268,8)to beg that you
may stay a little longer. Mrs(1848,10)will be very glad of your
company, I am sure.”

“I am much obliged(137,9)(1498,8) for your kind invitation,” replied(1425,10); “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
next Saturday.”

“Why, at that rate, you will(1433,11)here only six weeks. I(1911,9)
you to stay two months. I told(321,14)so before you came. There
can be no occasion(282,10)going(515,8). Mrs.(654,8)could(859,10)
spare you for another fortnight.”

“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”

“Oh, your father, of course, may (196,9), if(695,13)can.

world to that sort of thing. Y(166,11)should(241,8)be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my
niece Georgiana went to Ramsga(1132,8)summer, I made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the(2024,9) of Mr.

mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection
must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever(66,8) alone, she gave
way to it as(1234,14)relief; and not a day went by without a

unpleasant recollections.

studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely(1151,10). When she remembered the style of his address,
(390,8)still full of indignation: but w(85,8)considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed(274,10)became the object of compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character(922,8): but she
(1535,10)approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a su(346,9)yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest(2016,9)s(838,10)mothe(1252,8)manners so far from righ(633,9), was entirely insensible of the evil.(1373,11)had frequently
uni(232,9)Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of(1600,10)

what chance could there be of improvement?(1724,10), weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always

(823,11)n officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbour(77,14)be going there for
ever.

Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and (1677,11)
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
heighten(1583,8)ense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to
have been sincere,(1490,9)conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to(818,8)licit(1022,11) confidence in his friend. How
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness,(318,9)
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum(1428,8)own family!

When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s
(1775,9), it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom (206,9)essed before were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements at Rosings were as(1433,9) during the last week of
her stay as they(1212,11)t first. The very last evening was spent
there(1648,10)Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, ga(1255,8)dir(481,8)as(777,8)best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right

work(1850,8)morning, and pack her trunk afresh.(734,8)hey parted, Lady(1695,13)ith great condescension, wished them
a good(334,10)and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss de Bourgh exerted(266,9)so far as to courtesy and hold out
her hand to both.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.(74,16)]

On Saturday(373,8) Elizabeth(1588,9)Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes(977,8)the others appeared(756,8) took the opportunity of
pay(886,8)parting civilitie(1098,9)e deemed indispensably necessary.

“I know not, Miss(207,10),” said he, “whether Mrs(224,10)has yet
ex(1187,8)her(1753,10)your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. The favour(133,9)company has been much felt, I assure you. We know
how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the(125,8)we
see(1000,8)world, must make(864,10)extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself(379,8)hope(368,10)believe us grateful for the(1038,15)
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending
your time unpleasantly.”

(850,10)was eager with(494,12)and assurances of happiness. She had
spent six weeks(1249,12)enjoyment;(371,9)pleasure of being with
Charlotte(413,10)kind attention she had receive(418,13)_her_ feel
the(1502,8).(1064,13)was gratifi(1019,8)with a more smiling
solemnity replied,--

“It gives me the greatest(208,10)to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it(520,17)introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of
var(1307,9)humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
your(1725,10)visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation
with regard to(1902,15)’s family is, indeed, the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on
what a footing we are(34,10)how continually we are engaged there. In
truth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the dis(176,9)s of this
humble parsonage, I should not think(1372,8)abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at(566,8).”

Words were insufficient(1262,9)elevation of his feelings(1942,9)was
obliged to walk about the room(155,8)(1227,10)tried to unite(1966,8)y
and truth in a few short sentences.

“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I(773,9)myself, at least,(1074,10)will
be able to do so.(724,18)great(1307,10)s to Mrs(1260,10)you

(1232,8)r friend has drawn an un(1173,9)--but on this point it(1784,8)
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you(320,10)Miss(480,10),
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. My dear (1661,9) and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in(1948,12)a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to(1292,11)designed for each
other(1998,14)could safely say that it was a great(1991,10) where that was
the case,(1825,10)equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprang. Poo(501,11)!(285,8)melancholy to leave her to such(1850,8)! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently
regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not(526,9)ask for(1441,11). Her home and her housekeeping, her parish(33,9)poultry,
and(1617,8)ir dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

At length the chaise arriv(1900,8)trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and(692,8)pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting(845,9)the friends,(1577,11)was attended to the carriage by
Mr(1358,9); and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
(1845,8)kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner,(686,8)unknown. He then handed
her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten(954,10)any message (320,8)ladies of Rosings.

[Illustration:

“They had(85,31)”

“But,” he added, “(1992,8) of course wish(1481,9)your humble(525,9)
deliver(651,9)(258,8)your grateful thanks(205,8)ir(527,10)to you
while you(1588,11)here(1569,14)made no objection:(442,14)then allow(882,9)shut, and
(808,13)drove off.

“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!”

“A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.

“We have dined nine times at(572,8), besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!(1976,13)privately(587,9)And h(65,24)conceal!”

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr(1091,10)’s
house, where they(1750,9)remain a few days.

Jane looked well, and(1451,11)had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which(1358,14)of her aunt
had reserved(1080,8)m. But Jane was to go home(2037,9), and at
(1415,10)there would be leisure enough for observation.

It was not(438,9)an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for(128,10), before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know
(101,9)had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever(408,8)own
vanity(145,9)not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of w(430,8)should communicate,
and her fear, if she once entered(1864,8)subject,(1867,10)hurried into
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve(531,11)
further.


(1813,18)     “How nicely we are crammed in”
]




CHAPTER XXXIX.(75,16)](743,9)the second week in May, (345,9)the three young(1980,8)set out
together from Gracechurch Street(2036,9)town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s(1802,10)was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.
These two girls had(810,8)ove an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.

After welcoming thei(1191,8)s, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
“Is not this nice? i(18,11)an agreeable surprise?”

“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours(1344,9)hop out there.” Then showing
her purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do(255,8)nk it
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better.”

And when(1747,11)s abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, “Oh(1514,9)re were two or three much uglie(818,9)shop; and
when(339,15)some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
(371,8) will be very tolerable. Besides,(36,9)not much sign(1847,8)
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.”

“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

“They (104,10)to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there(1528,9)summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to
go, too, of all things! Only think what a miserabl(167,8) else we shall
have!”

“Yes,”(881,9)(352,9); “_that_(219,10)a delightful(215,8) indeed,
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven!(376,9) and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia(631,9) monthly balls of(665,8)!”

“Now(1213,8)got some news for you,” said Lydia(2002,10)sat down to
table. “What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like.”

Jane an(791,11) looked at each other(255,10)waiter was told that he
need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--

“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You(1493,9)the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared!(816,12)he often hears worse
things said than I am(1006,10)say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone. I never saw(973,8)long chin in my life. Well, but now for
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good(1092,9)waiter, is not it?
There is no danger of(67,8)’s marrying Mary King--there’(682,9)! She
is gone(669,8) her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.(172,8) is safe.”

“And(110,10)(26,8)!” add(1429,12); “safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.”

“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”

“But I hope t(308,11)strong attachment on either side(967,8)Jane.

“I am sur(70,13)t on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared
three straw(507,8)her. Who _could_ about(1571,8)nasty little freckled
thing?”

(979,10)was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the (40,14)the _sentiment_
was(162,8)other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!

As soon as all had ate(1441,10)elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with(1988,8)ir
boxes, workbags, and parcels(1583,10)unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and
Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.

“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “(1178,9) I brought my
bonnet, if it is only(1098,9)fun of having another band-box! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laug(319,9) way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men?(32,10)had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would(2025,10)a husband
before you came back. Jane will(307,10)an old maid soon, I declare.
(1233,8)lmost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not
being married before(76,19)My aunt Philips wants you so to
get(222,8)s you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not(1165,9)ere(342,12)b(440,8)fun in it. Lord!
how(238,10)like to be(233,16)any of you!(1051,8)n I would
_chaperon_ you about to(671,9)balls. Dear me! we had(1998,8)good piece
of fun th(1247,8)day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs.(62,8) promised to have a(1526,8)dance in the
evening; (by-the-bye,(74,14)and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced(52,8) by(1594,8);(403,9), what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only(98,8)hat fun! Not a soul knew of it, bu(452,10)(399,8)
Forster, and(463,13), except my aunt, for we were(262,11)borrow
one of her gowns; and(859,8)not imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more(1950,8)men came in, they
did not know him(1424,8)leas(887,8) how I laughed!(490,8)di(284,14). I thought(1171,10)have died. And _that_ made(145,9)suspect
somethin(1598,8)hen they soon found out what was the matter.”

With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,
assisted by(1963,9)hints and(1993,9)s, endeavour to amuse her
companions(1777,12) to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as(984,8)as she
could, but(1314,8)as no escaping the frequent mention of(534,8)’s name.

Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr(93,8)
say voluntarily to(273,10),----

“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”(218,8)party(697,8)dining-room was large, for(1875,8)(1513,8)Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects
which occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the
table, after the welfare and poultry(1083,8)eldest daughter;(444,12)
was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account(1058,8)present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below h(1303,8)o(1805,11),
retailing them all to the younger Miss(390,8); an(900,8) in a voice
rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerat(796,8)various
pleasur(1031,9) morning to anybody who would hear her.

“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us(1533,9)had such fun!
as we went along(1601,13) drew up(1071,9)blinds, and pretended
(1028,12)bod(752,9)coach; and(1397,15)gone so(1158,12), if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got(430,8)George, I do(1957,9)
behaved very handsomely(1790,9)treated(529,10) three with the nicest
cold luncheon(1661,8)world, and if you(412,8)(216,8), we(20,11)
(110,8)you too. A(1601,8)(209,8)came away it was(414,10)(1718,10)
we never(328,15)t into(366,10). I was ready to die of laughter.
(127,10)e were so merry(1556,13)home! we talked and(1893,8) so
loud, that(679,9)might have heard us ten miles off!”

To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such (843,9). They would doubtless be congenial(491,9)
generality of female minds. But I confess t(85,10)have no charms for
_me_.(742,10)infinitely prefer a book.”

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom(1933,10)to
(1050,8)for(1757,11)half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent(788,10)res(1417,9)girls to walk to
Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but(1871,10) steadily opposed
the scheme. It(1074,8)not be sai(627,8)the Miss Bennets c(41,12)at
home(272,8)day before they were in pursui(1629,9)officers. T(1230,8)
another reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham
again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to
_her_,(1803,8)regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond
expression. In a fortnight(279,11)to go(1841,8)c(1232,8)she hop(1513,9)could be nothing more to plague her on his(1986,8).

She(1497,14)many hours at home,(424,8)she found(495,10)Brighton

frequent discussion between her parents.(683,12)aw directly that her
father(1712,9)the smallest intention of yielding; but (1017,10)s were
at the same time so vague and equivocal,(122,9) mother, though often
disheartened, ha(1024,8)yet despaired of succeeding at last.

CHAPTER XL.(33,19)(972,9)’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened(951,9)
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which he(1581,8) was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief(1301,8)scene(584,9)Mr.
Darcy and herself.

(1207,11)’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admira(630,8)(1386,10)appear perfectly
natural; and all(254,9) was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy(1794,8)have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still mor(165,8)e grieved for the
unhappiness(520,17)’s refusal must have given him.

“His being so sure(812,15)was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment.”

“Indeed,” replied(1866,10), “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
(459,14) which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”

“Blame you! Oh, no.”

“But you(70,9) for having spoken so warmly of(1878,8)?”

“No--I(135,8)know that you were wrong in saying w(30,8)did(125,13)_will_ know it, when I have told you(1214,8)ppened the very
next day.”

She then spoke(1963,8)letter, repeat(1083,8)whole of its contents as far
as they(1206,10) George(255,8). What a stroke was this for poor Jane,
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in(206,11)race of mankind as was here
collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication(1763,8)
grateful(1425,8)(1166,8), capable of consol(1496,8)for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one,(315,9)inv(1704,8)he other.

“This will not do(1090,8)(1857,9); “you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit(1755,9)them; just
enough(163,9)one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all(1900,10)’s(245,10)shall do as you choose.”

I(1899,8)me ti(1210,13)before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

“(1149,14)(1078,12)been more shocked(1586,11). “Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor(1893,10)! dear Lizzy,
only(1624,10)what he(1765,11)suffered. Such a (1629,14)! and
with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and(1445,8)to relate such a
thing of his sister(220,8)really too distressing, I am sure(686,9)
feel it so.”

“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing
every moment more un(1451,10)and indifferent. Your profusion makes me
saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart(1055,10)s
light as a feather.”

“Poor(1836,8)! t(991,8)such an expression of goodness in his
countenance!(51,9)openness and gentle(52,11) manner.”

“There certainly(876,10)great mismanagement(1600,8)education of those
two young men. One has got all the(185,9), and(1392,10)(32,8)
appearance of it.”

“I never thought(852,10) so defici(153,11)_(68,10)_ of it as you
used to do.”

“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him(1615,10)any reason. It(452,10) spur to one’s genius,(481,8)
opening for wit, to have(106,10) of that kind. One may be continually
abusive(1758,9)saying(1653,9) just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man(1831,9)now(437,8)n stumbling on something witty.”

“Lizzy, when you first read that letter(1097,16)could not treat
the matter(1556,8)do now.”

“Indeed, I(55,10). I was uncomfortable enough, I was very
(33,13)--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I
felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say(1167,8)had not been so very weak,
and vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”

“How unfortunate tha(1880,8)ould have used such very strong(1118,11)s
in speaking of(1171,8) to(1740,10), for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved.”

“C(1115,8). But the misfortune of(114,10)with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is
one point on which I want your advice.(20,8)to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham’s character.”

Miss Bennet paused a little(1331,9)n replied, “Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”

“That it(230,10) to be attempted.(1419,11)has not authorized me to
make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was(1465,13)kept as much as possible to

conduct, who(2001,8)lieve me? The(488,9)(656,9) agains(1715,12)is
so violent, that it would be the death of half(1848,9)(158,8)in
Meryton, to(398,8) to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to
it.(993,9)will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to
anybody here what he really is. Some time hence(71,9)be all found
out(738,11)we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.
At present I will say nothing about it.”

“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for(278,9)has done, and anxious to
re-establish a(1045,11) We must not make him desperate.”

The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She
had got rid of two(1374,8)secrets which had weighed on her for a
fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she
might wish to talk again of either(1604,9)re was still something
lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not
relate the other half of(1800,10)’s letter, nor explain to her sister
how sincerely she(1698,10)valued by his friend. H(217,8)knowledge in
which no one could partake; and she was sensible that(760,9)less than
a perfect(1678,11)ing between the parties could justify her in
throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if
that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be
able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner
himself. The liberty of(1712,15)cannot be mine till it has lost
all its value!”

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of(594,11)’s spirits. Jan(102,8)t happy. She still cherished a
very tender affection for(305,8). Having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadin(698,8)(76,17)s often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sens(1469,8)ll her attention to the
feelings(438,8)friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
reg(1401,11)must have been injurious(1135,8)own health(1863,8)ir
tranquillity.

“Well, Lizzy(912,8)Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so(1426,11)day. But I
cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is(807,8)undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world(962,8)ever getting him now. T(68,8)no talk of his
coming to Netherfield again(94,8)summer; and I have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know.”

“(286,9)believe that he will ever live at(210,14)ny more.”

“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though I
shall always say(139,9)used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I was
her, I would not have put up with it(580,8)my comfort is, I am sure
Jane will die of a broken heart,(945,8)n(299,9)be sorry for what he
has done.”

But as Elizabeth c(162,9)receive(140,9)from any such expectation she
made no answer(1060,18)continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
Collinses live ver(281,9)able, do they? Well, well, I only hope it
will last. And what sort of table(70,8) keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as(232,12)
she is saving enough(944,13)thing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping(127,13)”

“No,(64,9)at all.”

“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will
take care not to outrun their income(50,13) never be distressed
for money(739,9)uch(147,8)y it do them! And so, I(1306,8), they often
(1238,9)aving Longbourn when your father is dead. They look(235,8)
quite as their own(468,12), whenever that happens.”

“It was a subject which they(825,11)mention before me.”

“No; it would(1920,11)strange if they had. But I make no doubt they
often(1500,9)it between themselves(1674,8)(81,8)can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully(277,12)so much the better. _I_ should be
ashamed(403,11)one that was only entailed on me.”


(1576,18)“When Colonel Miller’s regiment went away”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]




CHAPTER XLI.(116,16)]

The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the(180,9)’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course(302,10)employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was(1897,8), and who(1716,11)comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any(427,8)family.

“Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?” would(926,12)exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?”

Their affectionate mother share(584,9)ir grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.

“I am sure,” said she, “I cri(470,8)wo days together w(983,11)
(983,27). I thought I(1121,8)have broke my heart.”(138,12) I shall break _mine_(159,8)Lydia.

“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.

“Oh yes!--i(67,31) But papa is so disagreeable.”

“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”

“And my aunt Philips is sure(1608,10)do _me_ a(2030,19),”
added Kitty.

Such(914,9) kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
(1904,10)House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s
objections; and never had she(1919,8)been(1738,9)disposed to pardon his
interference(952,8)views of his friend.

But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wif(1390,8) colonel of the
(1822,8), to accompany her(736,12). This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

The rapture(419,9) on this(1261,9), her adoration of(381,14)
the delight(29,9)Bennet, and the mortific(67,9)Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstasy, calling(1101,9)yone’s
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued(1786,8)parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

“I cannot see why(816,13)(1591,8)not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”
(1725,11)though I am _not_ her particular(1017,8) I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”

In vain did(1361,11)attempt to make her (295,10), and Jane(33,8)
her resigned. As for(1441,11)herself, this(1144,12)was so far from
exciting in her the same(660,9) as(28,8)mot(983,13), that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detest(557,8)such a step must(302,9), were it
known, sh(1986,8)not help secretly advising(673,8)her not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties(1566,12)general
behaviour, the little advantage(163,11)derive from th(1460,8)ship of
such a woman as(1591,15)(1182,8)proba(345,10)her being yet more
imprudent with(332,8)companion at(1607,9), where the temptations must
be greater than at home. He heard her (1263,9)ly(1347,9)n said,--

“Lydia will never be easy till(858,8) exposed(721,8) in some public
place or(1626,12)we can never expect(1830,8)do i(254,8)o little
expense or inconvenienc(1447,9)family as under the present
circumstances.”

“If you were aware,” sa(1005,12), “of the very great dis(537,10)to
us all, which must aris(548,11)public notic(1786,10)’s unguarded and(501,11)manner, nay(88,8)has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently(1534,8)affair.”

“A(80,13)!” repeated Mr(1876,8). “What! has she frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor(838,8)Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as(1619,8)bear to be connected with a(937,9)bsurdity
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by(1086,9)folly.”

“Indeed, you are mistaken(1697,9)no such injuries to resent. It is not
of peculiar, but of(1187,8) evils(614,8)I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respect(1135,8)in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain(1580,8)restraint(775,8)ark
(1382,8)character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of check(1579,8)exuberant spirits, and
of teach(1618,8)that her(1062,8) pursuits (585,8)to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her(272,10)
will be fixed; and(81,9), at sixteen,(132,8)most determined flirt
that ever made(1409,9)and(1302,12)ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and,(1854,10)igno(596,10)empt(355,13)mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contemp(659,8)her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty
is also comprehended. S(506,8)follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh(762,9) (762,8)can you
suppose it possible that they(800,10)be censured and despised(165,9)
they are known(2039,8)at their sisters(82,13)often involved(565,8)disgrace?”

(1591,10) saw(862,10)whole heart was(1675,8)subject; and,
affectionately ta(973,9)hand, said, in reply,--

“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. W(410,8)you and Jane(253,11)
you(1292,9)respected and valu(922,8)you(1154,10)appear to less
advant(606,8)having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly
sisters. We shall(1593,9)peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief(1196,10)is luckily too poo(1966,8)an
object of prey to anybody. At (174,8)(1349,10)be of less (1737,10)
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The offic(705,9)find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore,(1573,10)being
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse,(1371,10)uthorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of (1679,8).”

With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but(196,9)opinion
continued the same,(1697,9)left him disappoin(817,8)sorry. It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.
She was confident of(873,8)performed her duty; and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.

Had Lydia(1897,9)mother know(1249,9)stance of her conference with her
(1507,8)their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to(898,10)comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets(1957,9)gay bathing-place covered with(958,9).
She saw herself the (1109,10)attention to tens(502,8)scores of them at
present unknown(192,9) all the glori(52,9) camp: its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowd(210,8)the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
(277,12)seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirt(98,9)at least six
(1320,9)at once.

[Illustration:

“T(72,16)”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

Had she(786,9)at her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what(808,9)ve(1543,9) sensations? They could
(37,10)understood only by(964,11), who might have felt nearly the
same.(863,9)going(848,13)was all that consoled her(1468,8)
melancholy conviction(1064,8)husband’s never intending to go there
himself.

But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures(1523,10), with little intermission, to the very day of(1127,9)leaving
home.

(1658,14)now to see Mr. Wickham(1740,9)last time. Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the(36,10)s of former partiality(321,10)so. She had even
learnt to detect, in(271,10)gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
behaviour to(1312,8), moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;
(384,8)inclination he soon testified of renewing those(1404,10)s which
had marked the early(1855,9)their acquaintance could only serve, after
(681,9)since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
finding(1594,11)us selected as(1611,15)such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his(385,12)had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
and her preference secured, at any time, by(1062,8)enewal.

O(755,11)last(1031,8)the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,
with other(1910,9)(2041,8), at Longbourn; and so(1168,8)was (1116,9)
disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some
inquiry as(1246,8)manner in(969,8)er time(1346,11) at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were(850,9)ed with the former.

He looked surprised,(1021,9)ed, alarmed; but, with a moment’s
recollection, and a returning smile, replied(702,8)e had formerly seen
him often; and, after observing(58,9)was a(1353,12)manlike man,
asked her how(1245,9)liked him. Her answer was warmly(871,8)favour.
With an air of indifference,(1271,9)afterwards added, “How long did you
say(185,14)(430,9)?”

“Nearly three weeks.”

“And you saw him (1758,10)?”

“Yes, almost e(1889,8).”

“His manners ar(1918,8)ifferen(755,9)s cousin’s.(79,9)(42,14); but I think(653,10) improves on(1446,13).”

“Indeed!” cried(1978,8)(561,9)look which did not escape her. “And pray
may I ask--” but checking himself, he(371,8)in a gayer tone, “Is it in
address(627,9)(189,8)? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his
ordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continu(152,9)lower and more
serious(169,8)(152,9)s(344,8)d in essentials.”

“Oh, no!” said(1232,10). “I(44,12), I believe, he is very much
what he ever was.”

W(1699,10)poke,(432,8)(1036,8)as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen w(921,8)pprehensive
and anxiou(1775,11),(1925,11)added,--

“When I said(537,16)d(726,16), I(683,9)mean that
either his mind or(883,9)were in a state of(818,8)m(853,9)that,
from(340,9)him better, his disposition was better understood.”

Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes(1383,8)silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,--

“You, who so well know my feelings towards(1822,10), will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must (690,8)(890,11)wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to(1228,10)to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that
the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is
merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed(1505,8)wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he
ha(1398,11) at heart.”

(1464,9) could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She saw(1780,9)wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. The rest(138,8)evening passed with(844,17),(567,8)side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt(1636,8)inguish(353,10); and they parted at last with mutual(2019,9), and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.

When the party broke up, Lydia return(253,8)Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence(704,13) set out early the next mor(1862,9) separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears;(659,9)did weep from vexat(1621,8)envy. Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse(2018,8)good wishes for the felicity(1004,8)daughter,
and impressiv(68,9)injunctions that she w(855,9)miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as(513,8)e,--advice which there
was every reason to believ(120,8)be attended to; and,(1776,8)clamorous
happiness of Lydia(140,9)in bidding farewell, the mor(1843,8) adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.

CHAPTER XLII.(67,16)]

Had (1240,9)’s(1504,9)(1586,8) drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal(562,11)r domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beau(1022,8)that (2024,10)
of good-humour(1820,10)(59,13) generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ev(1838,9)ll his views of
(351,8) (701,10)were overthrown. But Mr. (1015,11)not of a
disposition to seek comfort(1025,9)disappointment which his own
impru(184,10)brought on in any of those pleasures(957,8)oo often
console the unfortunate(1154,8)ir folly (15,9)vice. He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
the sort of(483,12)hich a man would in(754,8) wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
(2043,10), however, had never been blind to the improprie(1651,9)
father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his(955,10)ate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget w(1786,8)c(1786,9)overlook, and to
banish(1410,10)thoughts that continual breach(1379,13)obligation
and decorum which, in expos(234,8)wife(351,8)contempt(1999,8)own
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she(446,11)felt so
strongly as now(1079,9)dvantag(1012,9)must attend the (121,8) of so
unsuitable a(1370,9), nor (557,10)so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents(315,8)rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind(58,8)wife.

When(1982,10) had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss(326,8)regi(1157,8)eir parties
abroad were less vari(1261,8)before; and at home(551,9)a mother and
sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around
them threw a real gloom ove(1582,8)(1813,9)circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since(1808,8)turbers
of her brain were removed, her other (247,8)from whose (1911,11)
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situa(761,8)such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefo(626,13), what
has(934,8)metimes found before, that an event to which(1111,9)looked
forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the
(751,13)(1210,8)promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name som(1850,9)eriod for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
(67,12)oint on which her wishes and hopes(525,10)fixed, and by
again enjoy(1090,8)pleasure of anticipation, console(237,8)(180,8)
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour(1959,8)Lakes
w(1521,11)objec(1624,9)happiest(1750,9): it was her best consolation
for(439,8) uncomfortable hour(1600,8)the discontented(1063,8)her mother
and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

“But it is fortunate,”(2002,8) she, “that I have something to wish for.
Were(875,10) arrangement complete, my(414,15) would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope(734,8) all my expectations of
(668,9)realized. A scheme of which(363,12)promises delight can
never be successful; and general(273,16)is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”

When Lydia went away she(1092,10)to write very often and very minutely
to(674,11) (674,9); but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. Those (97,14)contained(221,8)else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and(52,8)he had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that(1556,9)a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she(926,12)described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and (329,10)going to the
camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less
to be learnt, for(555,13)to Kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.

After the first fortnight or three week(1407,9)(1061,9)health,
good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything
wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town(1952,9)winter
came back again, and summer finery(18,12)engagements arose. Mrs.
Bennet was restored(895,8)usual querulous serenity; and by the middle
of June Kitty was so much recovered a(410,8)able to enter Meryton
without tears,--an event of such happy(1360,8) as to make Elizabeth
hope, that(160,8)following Christmas she might be so tolerably
(1548,9)e as not to mention an(1069,8) above once a day, unless, by
some cruel and malicious(1791,13)at the War Office, another regiment
sh(1800,8)quartered in(305,8).

The time fixed(545,9)beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a(797,12)nly was wanting of it, when a letter
arriv(1394,8)Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. Mr(79,10) w(274,8)prevented by business from
setting out till(209,13)later in July, and must be in London again
within a month; and as that left too short a perio(387,9)m to go so
far, and see(789,9)as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort(70,10)built on,(1478,11)(1561,11)give up
the Lakes(1071,8)bstitute a more contracted tour; and, accord(1556,11)present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that
county(1584,11)enough to be seen to occupy the chief(727,10)three
weeks; and to(640,14) it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town(2031,15)formerly passed some year(1576,9)life, and where
(1860,10)now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.

(1327,9) was excessively disappointed:(261,9)set her heart on seeing(588,10); and still thought ther(1382,8)have been time enough. But it
was her(965,10)to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

With the(1487,9)of(659,11),(644,8)ere many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her(940,8)the word (1738,9)hinking of Pemberley and its
owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars,(145,9)his perceiving me.”

The(1214,8)of expectation(1575,9)doubled. Four weeks(1011,9)pass away
before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did(60,10), and Mr. and
(1601,16)ith their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The(49,11)two girls of six and eight(981,8)ld, and two
younger boys(1252,10)be left under the particular care(1909,10)cousin
Jane, who was the general favourit(1090,9)ose steady sense and
sweetness of(762,8)exactly adapted her for atten(1449,11)m in every
way--teaching them, playing(356,9)m, and lov(36,8).

The(2000,9)s stayed only one night at (374,9)(1775,8)t off the next
morn(108,9)(1156,10)in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One
enjoyment was(1040,8)--that of suitableness as companions; a
(30,13)which comprehended health and(1116,13)ar
inconveniences--cheerful(1195,8)enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if(1178,11)
(1441,10)ments abroad.

It is not the(1609,10) this work to give a descrip(1285,19)
nor of any of the remarkable places through whic(921,8)route thither
lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are
sufficiently known. A small part(1469,14) i(1825,10)present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of (1146,13)’s
former residenc(2025,12)(1822,9)lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
(216,10)incipal wonders(417,8)country; and within five miles of
(236,9)(2041,10)found, from her aunt, that(1705,11)was situated. It
was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over(577,15)e evening before,(404,14) expressed an
inclination(1924,12)place again. Mr(62,11)declared his
willingness, and(1172,11)was applied to(2024,9)approbation.

“My love, should not you like(144,8)a place of which you have heard so
much?” said(396,9). “A place, too, wit(882,8)so many of your(616,14)are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know.”

(259,14)distressed. She felt that(765,9)no business at
(572,9), and was obliged to assume a dis(443,12)for seeing it. She
must own(110,10)was tired of great houses: after go(595,9)so many,
she really(174,8)(1440,8) in fine carpets or satin curtains.

(635,14)abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished,” said she, “I(572,12)care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful. They have some(1463,8)finest woods in the
country(488,14)said no more; but her mind c(726,9)acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing(917,10), instantly
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and
thought i(64,11)better to speak openly to(1255,14)n to run such
a risk. But against this(1914,11) objections; and she finally resolved
that it c(207,8)the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the
absenc(460,10)amily were unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether(1536,12)ere not a very fin(456,9)what was the name of its
proprietor, and, with no(1921,8)alarm, (110,8)(224,16)down for
the summer? A most welcome negative followed(359,10)question; and her
alarms being now removed,(1110,9)at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity(1639,12)house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning,(584,9)was again(1653,11), could readi(492,9), and
with a proper air of indifference,(1446,16)t(1287,8)any dislike
to the scheme.

To(2045,10), therefore, th(526,8)to go.

CHAPTER XLIII.(74,16)](1669,11), as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of(1674,10) Woods with some perturba(551,10)when at length they turned
in(1148,8)lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in on(866,8) lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretch(1838,9)a wide extent.(1564,11)’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves(1569,8)top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased(88,9) eye was(1701,10) caught by(593,11)House, situated on the opposite sid(1927,9)valley, into which
the road(659,11)abruptness wound. It was a(569,8)handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial(935,11). Its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. (1052,9) was delighted. She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or wher(228,9)
beauty had been s(1726,9)counteracted by an awkward taste. T(1324,8)
all of them warm in their admir(1153,11)at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of(1954,11)might be something!

They de(838,8)the hill, crossed the brid(1170,8)drove(1450,9)oor; and,
while examining the nearer aspect(742,8)house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid(389,9)
mistaken. On applying(1936,12)plac(1709,13)admitt(669,8)the
hall; and(584,10)(1636,10)wait(1622,11)housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where(1999,8).

T(68,14) came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than(2013,9)any notion of finding her. They
followed her(266,9) dining-parlour(1137,18)well-proportioned
room(1161,10)ly fitted up(918,11), after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. T(692,12)wned with wood, from
which they had(751,10), receiving increased(1377,12)from the
distance, was (1830,12)object. Every disposi(353,8)the ground was
good; and she look(1554,10)whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on i(1294,8)(1681,10)winding(1614,16)as far as she could trace
it, with(1306,8). As they pass(1448,8)other rooms, these objects were
taking different (257,8)s; but from every(456,9)here were beauties
to be seen. The rooms were lofty and(1753,9)(2013,9)ir furniture
suitabl(1181,9)fortun(1886,8)ir proprietor; but(1567,11)saw, with
(1390,10) of his taste, that it was(1660,9)gaudy nor uselessly
fine,--with less of splendour(926,11)real elegance, than the
(208,9) of Rosings.

“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been(1544,9)! With
thes(346,8)(45,13)now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger,(84,14)rejoiced in(45,9)my own, and
welcomed to(77,9)visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting
herself, “that coul(2007,8)be;(73,18) would(292,11)lost to
me; I should no(327,12)allowed to invite them.”

This(1291,8)ucky(156,11)on--it saved her from(1915,10) like regret.

She long(102,8)quir(698,8)(1561,13)whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it. At length, howe(1126,9)question was
asked by her uncle(1209,10)turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds
replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with(1637,8)
party of friends.” How(615,10)was(977,11)that their own journey had
not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw
the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other
miniatures, over the mantel-piece. (167,9)asked her, smilingly, how
she liked i(1844,8)(599,11)came forward, and told them(1269,8)the
pic(1179,8)a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who
had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the
army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has(692,8)out very wild.”

Mrs. Gardiner(1939,8)at her niece(646,8)smile,(1592,15)c(1070,8)

other--about eight years ago.”

“I have heard much of you(1121,8)’s fine person(212,13)(313,8),

“And do not you think him a very(291,10)(852,11)ma’am?”

“Yes,(40,14).”

“I am sure _I_ know none so(371,9); but in the gallery upstairs you
will see a finer, larger(1243,8) of him than this. This room was my late
(562,10)avourite room, and thes(739,12) are just as they used to
be then. He was very fond of(1917,14)accounted to(1536,11)for(1382,12)’s being among them.(587,15) then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only(871,13)old(1044,8)is(62,11) as(789,10)as her brother?(1080,9)(1180,10).

“Oh, yes--the(849,9)s(674,13)that ever was seen; and so
accomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from(1224,10): she
comes here(2032,10) with him.”

(250,12), whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks:(1445,16)either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his si(1129,8)Is(1389,12) much at Pemberley(953,8)course(1577,8)year?”

“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and(679,12)is always(482,10)the summer months.”

“Except,” though(1832,11), “(804,9)goes to Ramsgate.”

“I(1649,13) would marry, you might see mo(1166,9).(1302,9)sir;(231,8)o not know when _that_ will be.(35,17)o is
good enough for(646,12)an(1772,15) smiled.(1647,11)could not help saying, “It is

him,” replied the other(199,12)(440,8)this was going pretty far;
and she listened with(1893,8)ing astonishmen(1495,8) housekeeper added,
“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him
ever since he was four(1403,11)(1577,8)was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. That(108,8)not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
Her keenest(1634,11)was awakened: she longed to hear mo(926,8)was
grateful to her uncle for(639,8)--

“There are very few people of whom(1084,9)can be said. You are lucky in
having such a master(896,13), I know I am. If I were to go through the world,(1194,9)not
meet with a better. But(495,8)always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are (32,18)they grow up; and he
wa(1262,9)the sweetest (478,8), most generous-hearted bo(1448,8)
world.”

(1056,10)almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?(1344,10)she.

“His father was an excellent man,” sai(1189,15).(1307,8)ma’am, t(693,11)indeed;(1675,10)on(1311,8) just like him--just
as affable to the poor(226,14)(1040,8), wondered, doubted,(691,8) impatient for more. Mrs.
(1910,8) could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions(1852,8)rooms, and the pric(1880,8)
furniture in vain. Mr(1533,10), highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again(386,8)subject; (1425,8)dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

“He is the best landlord(321,10)best master(653,8)she, “t(1687,8)
lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name. Some(1310,8)call him proud; but(1967,10) I never
saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other(276,10).”

“In what an amiable light does this place him!(1085,10)(2007,9).

“This fine account of him,” whispered her au(1975,9)y walked, “is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”

“Perhaps we might be deceived.”

“That(460,8)very likely; our authority was too good.”

On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking(1435,8)room, when
last at Pemberley(973,10)certainly(770,8)broth(959,10)(1723,9), as she walked towards
on(1330,8) windows.

Mrs. (1484,9)anticipated(192,11)’s delight, when she should enter
(1442,8). “And this i(1942,13)way(635,8)m,” she added. “Whatever
can give his sister any(342,9), is (351,8)be done in a moment. There
is(1152,9)he would not do for her.”

T(1654,10) gallery, and two or thre(305,9)principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:
bu(1023,11) knew(1348,9)of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy’s, in crayons, whos(1981,10) were usually more interesting, and
also(27,10)lligible.

In th(379,9) there(289,11)family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the atten(1941,8)a stranger.(350,11)walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it
arrested her--(2019,8)beheld a striking resemblance of Mr.(1061,9)ith
such a smile over the face(983,9)remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before t(788,10), in
earnest contemplation, and re(585,10)it again(71,11)y quitted the
gallery. (1135,14)(1370,11)em,(1376,9)(724,9)taken in his
father’s lifetime.

There wa(1310,13)t this moment, in(1880,10)’s mind, a more gentle
sensation(1324,8) the original than(841,9)ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by(277,14)
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an(885,9)ent servant? As a(1599,9) a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people’s happiness(1830,8) his guardianship! How
much of(1820,10)or pain(1866,8)in his power to bestow! How (60,8)good
or evil must(1535,9)by him! Every idea tha(580,11)brought forward by
the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and(1876,8)stood before
the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon
herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude
than(826,8)ever raise(168,8):(1079,16)its warmth, and softened
its impropriety of expression.

When all(1815,8)house that was open to general inspection(1704,10)seen,
they(1091,10)down stairs; and, taking leav(1924,9)(435,11), were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.

As they(1553,8)across the law(1037,14)river,(1955,11)turned back
(1868,9)gain; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was
conjecturing as(210,8)dat(262,9)building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came(760,9)from the road which led behind it(319,8)stables.

They were within twenty yards of each oth(804,8)so abrupt was his
appearance(1503,10)was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheek(133,10)were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely star(928,10)or a moment seemed immovable from
surprise; but shortly recovering(387,8), advanced(1617,13)party,
and spoke to(1691,10), if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
(31,12)ivility.

She had instinctively(685,8)away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment(457,15)be
overcome. Had his first (522,12)or his resemblance(956,8)picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy,(1069,13)’s(1258,11) of (492,8), on
beholding his(1827,9)must immediately have told it. They stood a little
aloof while(1577,8)talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes(1730,8)face, and knew not what answer she
(1411,9)(1781,8)ivil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the
alteration(1719,8)manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her(624,14); and e(2029,10)of the
(1717,15)her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes i(1994,8)they continued together were som(1690,9)most
uncomfortable(133,8)life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
(451,11)(1607,9)tim(153,9)having left Longbourn, and(320,8)stay
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly(1253,8)he
distrac(552,12)thoughts.

At length(543,8)idea(1411,8)to fail him; and after standing a few
mo(1189,10)out saying a word, he (1814,9)recollected(1456,11)nd took
leave.

T(1095,8)s then joined her, and(1069,8)ed their admi(777,13)
figure; but(1510,10) heard not(156,9)and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and
vexation. Her coming there was(710,9) unfortunate,(22,10)ill-judged
thing in the world! How strange must i(1520,8) to him! In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! I(38,8)seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?
or,(22,9)he thus come a day befor(1455,9)expected? Had they been
only ten (1095,8)sooner, they should have been beyond the reach(566,8)discrimination; for it w(855,8)(1330,8) was that moment arrived, that
(21,8)lighted from his horse(1921,8)carriage. She blushed again and
again over the perverseness(1275,9)eeting. And his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he(297,8)even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire(1732,10)
family! Never in(1443,9) had she seen(1735,11)s so little dignified,
never had he spoken(133,11)gentleness as on this un(570,8)(308,9)
What a contrast did it offer(1989,8)last address in Rosings Park, when
he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to
account for it.

They had now entered a beautiful walk by the sid(1808,9)water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
(801,9)the woods to(1956,12)were approaching: but(823,8)some time
before(1421,11)was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically(1881,8)(1914,9)appeals(2046,8)uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part(913,8)scene. Her(1891,9) were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever i(1442,8)be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She longed to know what at(1192,13)was passing(1441,8)mind; in
what manner he(192,8) of(1912,10)whether, in defiance of everything,
she was still d(1671,10). Perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease; yet ther(63,11)_that_(1645,8)voic(318,8) was
not like ease. Whether(129,8)felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainl(947,8)t seen her with
composure.

At length, however, the remark(704,9)companions on her absence of mind
roused(415,10)she felt the necessity of appearing more like(1961,8)(1131,8)(1123,8)(999,9), and, bidding adieu(884,9)iver for a while,
ascended som(1164,9)higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally(1016,14)tream. Mr. Gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared(1014,12)
beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile,(1421,11)told, tha(1415,9)ten
miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after(1528,10), in a descent among

They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character(503,10)general air(559,8)scene:(1722,8)a spot less adorned than any t(1949,8)yet visited; and(632,13)here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood(404,8)ordered
it.(1902,11)(1565,10)explore its windings; but when(219,10)crossed
th(332,10)and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs(782,10),
who was not a great walker, could go no fart(1650,9)(1670,9)nly of
returning(2046,8)carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit(115,8)ey took their way towards(222,10)
on(1111,14)sid(1270,9)river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for(1096,13), though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the

about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner(1248,12)again surprised, and(747,10)’s astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approa(299,9)(929,8)t no great(778,9). The walk being here less

interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt(553,9)would probably strike into som(304,8)path. The idea
lasted while a (1064,8)(686,9)lk concealed him(1200,9)ir view; the
(1119,8)past, he was immediately(392,11)m(1933,9)glance she saw that
he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,
she began as they met to admire the beauty(1853,8)place; but she had not
got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky
recollections obtrud(899,8)she fancied that praise of Pemberley from
her might be mischievously construed. Her colour chang(104,12)said
no more.

(1644,13) was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her if s(646,9)do hi(1752,8)nour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of(499,9) for which she was quite un(931,8); and
she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seek(1484,8)acquaint(1475,13)of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his(1436,9),”(1986,8)
she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of
fashion.”

The(388,9)tion(1283,9),(944,17)made; and as she named their
relationship(211,11), she stole a sly look at him,(1430,9)ow he bore
it;(1892,9)not without the expectation(1029,8)decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. T(1321,8)as _(1801,9)_ by the
connection was evident: he sustained it(310,12)ith fortitude: and,
so far from going away, turned back with(1807,11)entered into
conversation with Mr(934,10)(1730,11) could not but be pleased,
(26,14)triumph. It was consoling(1595,9)should know(1277,9)some(491,10) for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
attentively to all that passed between(268,11)gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.

The (381,13)soon(439,8)upon fishing;(1464,9)heard Mr. Darcy
invite him,(484,9) greates(1726,10), to fish there as often(719,8)hose, while he continued(1942,8)neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with(195,8) tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where(511,11)usually most sport. (1618,13), who was
walking arm in arm with(716,10), gave her a look (503,8)v(487,8)
wond(769,14)said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for(1435,10)Her astonishmen(1011,13)as
extreme; and(414,8)ally was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From
what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, i(23,18)y_ sake
that his(715,8) are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford(1091,10)
work such a change as this. It is impossible(1080,16)still love
me.”

After (502,8)some time in this way, the two ladies in front(25,9)
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspec(1640,8)some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in

(1525,9)’s arm inadequate to her support,(661,8)sequently preferred
her husband’s.(1208,10) took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to
know that(1654,9)been assured(2040,8)absence before she came(483,8)pla(167,8)accordingly began by observing, (811,9)arrival(115,9)
very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed,(223,8)we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately (193,8) in
the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest(911,8)party with whom (515,12)travelling. “They
will join me early(330,10),”(1833,13), “and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”
(914,10) answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when (129,11)’s nam(802,11)last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from(426,8)plexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.

“There is also one other person in(473,10)(404,15) after a
pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your(497,13)
during your stay at Lambton?”

The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She(984,13)felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being(735,9)ed with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory(244,9)gratifying(237,9)(1397,9)resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.

They now(1663,10) in(1642,8); each of them deep in(880,8). (1848,9)
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. His wish of(619,9)ing(1060,11)(1943,8)was a compliment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

He then asked(689,8)walk into the house--(292,8)declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
have been said, and(502,8) was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that
s(1692,22)(229,11)talked of Matlock and Dovedale with
great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--(27,8)patience
(44,8)ideas were nearly worn out (1908,11)_tête-à-tête_ was over.

On(560,22)’(1998,9)up they were all pressed to go into
(535,9) and take some refreshment; but this was declin(548,12)
parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
ladies(685,10)(791,8)(831,11)it drove off,(1055,10) saw him
walking slowly towards(763,10).

The observations(1341,8)uncle and aunt now began; and(1192,13)
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything(1018,9) expected.

“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said(181,10)(2010,10)_is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her
aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say(511,10)housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_I_ have seen nothing of it.”

“I was never mor(2027,10)d than by his behaviour to us. It was more
than civil(2040,9)really attentive;(1291,8)re was no necessity for such
attention. His(1976,9)ance with(685,11)(1279,9)trifling.”

“T(404,10) Lizzy(488,12)aunt, “he(376,8)so handsome as Wickham;
or rather he has not(30,8)’s countenance, for his features are
(652,10)good. But how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?”

(927,10)excus(1639,11)as well as she could: said that (1456,8)liked
him better(1860,11)met in Kent than before(1720,8)(69,11)never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.

“But perhaps he may be(842,10)whimsical in his civilities(843,10)

at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds.(422,13)felt(929,8)(1196,8)ntirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.

“From what we(961,11)of him,” continue(1719,15), “I really
should not have thought(626,9)could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as(784,8)done by poor(823,8). H(813,10)an ill-natured look.
On the contrary, there is(1390,11)pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. A(1103,9)(64,13)of dignity(604,9)(942,12)that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But(1524,13) the
good lady who showed u(1836,11) did give him a most flaming(515,10)!

guarded a manner(1278,13), that by w(1281,12)heard from his
relations(1275,8), his actions were capable of a very different

(1613,10)so amiable, as(1077,10)been considered in Hertfordshire. In
confirm(359,8) this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
trans(256,8)in which(139,18)nected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it(827,9)ch as might be relied on.

(1226,13) was surprised and concerned: but(303,9)were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recolle(493,11)she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband(375,9)interesting spots in its environs, to think of
anything else. Fatigued(2038,8)(555,9)by the(1925,8)’s walk,(1669,9)
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest(310,14)
acquaintance,(1908,8) evening was spent(1126,8)satisf(850,8)of an
intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of(347,9) to leave (1944,9)
much attention for any of these new friends(488,10)could do nothing
but think(261,8)ink with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above
all,(1630,8)wishing her to be (364,8)ed with his sister.

CHAPTER XLIV.(35,19)(1480,11)ad settled it that(176,10) would bring(119,11) to visit
her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,
resolved no(1047,8)out of sight(483,8)inn the whole of that(737,8).
But her conclusion was false; for on(173,10)morning after their own
arrival at Lambton these visitors came. T(1432,13)walking about the
place with some of their(600,12), and were just returned to(241,8)
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew(1873,9)a window(964,9)y saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle driving up the street.(865,10), immediately recognizing the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of(1543,9)(1364,8)(1987,9), by(817,9)ing them(294,10)honour which she
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement(2015,8)e embarrassment
of her manner(1419,8)spoke, joi(468,11)circumstance itself, and many
of(37,17)(1250,9)preceding day, ope(555,10)m a new idea on
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for s(1361,13)s from such
a quarter than by supposing a partiality fo(907,8)niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of(1272,10)’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the(264,12)of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

She retreated from the(1108,9)fearful of being seen; and(804,8)walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring(1059,9) in h(988,18)as made everything worse.

Miss Darcy and her(394,9)appeared(2030,9)s formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did(1323,10) see that her new
(2035,8)ance was at least as much(1152,10)ed as(275,8). Since her
being(1736,11), she had heard that (236,11)was exceedingly proud;
but the observ(842,8) a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only(93,13)shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllabl(439,15)was tall, and on a larger scale than(1706,10); and, though
little(838,11)sixteen, her figure was form(522,8)(540,10)ance

unassuming and gentle(1962,13)who had (1806,8) to find(828,8)as
acute and un(636,13)n observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different(1437,9).

They had not been long together before Darcy tol(639,11)Bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and(797,9)barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare(1792,11) visitor, when(130,8)’s quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a(1673,8)he entered(1302,9). All(1736,13)anger against him(374,9) long done away; but had she still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground(103,9)the unaffected
cordiality with which he(319,8)ed himself on seeing h(183,8). He
inquired in a friendly(919,8) general, way, after her family, and
looked and spoke with the same(832,12)ed eas(1397,9) had ever done.

To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to(1437,10)(715,9)long wished to see him. The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions(392,8)ad just
arisen of(931,11)and their niece, directe(22,8)(1528,12)towards
each with an earnest(426,10)uarded, inquiry;(99,8)y soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them(1802,10)knew what
it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.
(932,10), on her side, had much to do(1559,8)nted to ascertain the
(1287,8) of each of her(1125,8)s, s(62,13)compose her own, and to

feared most to fail(126,8)s most sure of success, for those to whom
she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possesse(1668,9)favour.

pleased.

I(1261,9)Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sist(1687,8)oh!
how ardently did she(1797,8) know whether any of his were(972,10)in a
like manner. Sometimes she could fancy(1301,9)talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased(624,9)(1414,9)notion
that, as he (1459,8)t her,(1375,8)trying to trace a resemblance. But,
though this might be imaginary,(214,11)not be deceived as to his
behaviour to Miss Darcy, who(1862,10)set up as a rival to Jane. No
look appeared on eit(1005,8) that spoke particular regard. Nothing
occurred between them tha(1939,8)justify the hopes(485,8)sister. On
this point(918,9)soon satisfied; and two or three(1280,8)circumstances(142,10)ere they parted, which,(913,8)anxious interpretation, denoted
a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of
saying more that might lead to the men(97,8)her, had he dared. He
observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and
in a tone(1879,11)something of real regret, that it “was a very long
time since he had had th(1286,11)of(1079,8)her;” and, before(942,10)
reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the
26th of November, when we were all danc(271,12) at Netherfield.”(1773,11) was(1026,9)to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took(1115,9) to ask h(147,9)unattended to by(1262,8)the rest,(1287,8)
_all_(1355,11)s were at Longbourn. There was not much(1796,8)question,
nor(1817,8)preceding remark; but t(69,9)a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.

It(122,9)often that(1418,11)turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but
whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all(1543,9)said, she heard an accent so far
removed from _hauteur_ or disdain(1683,8)companions, as convinced her
that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,
however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one
day. When(317,9)him thus seeking the acquaint(313,10)courting the
good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would
have been a disgrace; w(159,21)civil, not only to(1925,8),
but(1330,8)very relations whom(1163,8)openly(441,8)ed, and(1481,10)ed
their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the
chang(1699,8) great, and struck so forcibly on her mind,(805,15)
hardly restra(1686,8)stonishment from being visible. Never, even in the
company(1877,8)dear friends(1259,15), or his dignified(328,10)
at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importanc(1561,10)sult from the success(903,8)endeavours, and when even the
(727,12) of those to whom his attention(1367,8)ddressed, would draw
down the ridicule and cen(1762,8)the ladies both of(1621,12) and
Rosings.

Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour;(220,10)they arose
to depart,(1362,11)called on his sister to join him i(1341,10)ng
their wish(1961,11)Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley(2014,9)they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little(1750,8)habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed.(199,14) looked at her niece,(719,10)of knowing
how _she_, whom the(104,11) most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,(1620,8)is studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislik(698,9)proposal, and(517,8)in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attend(1974,10)the day after the next was fixed on.

Bingley(719,8)ed great pleasur(557,9)certainty(739,11)(390,9)
again, having still a great deal to sa(1664,8), and many inquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire(1414,8).(514,10), construing all
this into a(916,9)hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and
on this account, as well as some others, found(1878,9)(1120,9)ir
(1181,9)(959,8)m, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction(1006,10)hile it was pass(71,8)enjoyment of it had been
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of(405,11)or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she(1405,18)only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley(701,9)n hurri(985,8)to dress.

But she had no reason to fear(1401,22)’s curiosity; it was
not (1468,11)to force her communication. It was evident that she was
much better (1837,8)(1676,8)(1620,10)than they had(1502,8)any idea of;
i(100,19)he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justif(885,8)y.

Of(1782,11)it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as thei(255,10)ance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference
to any other(1029,10)the circle in(1179,15)to which(436,8)known
would not have recognized it for(546,10). T(296,11)w an (458,9)
(1730,8) in believ(1079,8)housekeeper;(1528,8)y soon became sensible(1790,8)e authority of a(276,8), who had known him since(646,8)four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred(1673,8)intelligence of
their Lambton(1568,8) that could materially lessen its weight. They had
(808,11)accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
it would(1841,8)ly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town
where the family did not visit(1169,9)acknowledged, (550,9)that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

With(445,8) to Wickham, the travellers soon found(1197,13)not held
there in much estimation; for(1737,8)the chief of his concerns(1616,9)
son(29,8)patron were imperfectly understood,(1813,8)yet a well-known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, whic(1500,12)afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, he(249,8)ts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last(993,9)(36,8),(326,8)as it passed it seemed long(888,9)

she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She

had almost as long been ashamed of ev(220,10) a dislike against him,
(1069,11)be so called. The(776,9)crea(963,11)convicti(667,9)
valuable qualities(414,10)t first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to(427,13); and(1975,12)heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature(1167,8)testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. But above all, abov(373,10)and esteem,

loved her, but for loving her still well(869,11)forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and(67,9)unjust accusations accompany(140,8)rejection. He who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and
without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,(1834,10)ir two selves only were(1617,8)ed, was soliciting the good
opin(971,8)er friends, and bent on mak(490,8)known to his sister. Such
a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but
(665,9)--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as
such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no
means unpleas(1647,12)i(1328,8)not be exactly defined. S(1338,10)ed,
she esteemed, she(897,9)eful to him, she felt a real interest(1166,8)welfare;(1537,8) only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and(60,9)it w(1552,8)for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of(1380,10)on the renewal of his addresses.

It(975,9) settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them(163,8)very

breakfast--ough(669,8)imitated(640,26)qualled, by
some exer(1950,8)politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
(512,9)highly expedient to wait(846,8)(232,12) the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased;(875,8)when
she asked(687,8) the reason(1498,10)very little to say in reply.

Mr. Gardiner left them soon after (382,9). The fishing schem(1596,11)renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made(707,8)meeting
some of the gentlemen(333,14)by noon.

CHAPTER XLV.(65,16)]

Convinced as(388,11)now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike(1966,8)had
originated in jealousy, she(1315,11)help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance(595,14)(1510,8)to her, and was curious(1272,8)
with how much(969,10)on that lady’s sid(1937,18) would now
be renewed.

On reach(1836,8)house, t(718,8) shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,
open(1153,10) ground, admitted a most refreshing view(613,8)high woody
hills behind(217,12)and(659,8)beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this room(328,11)received by(1399,11), who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and(682,13), and the lady with whom she lived in
London. Georgiana’s recep(1335,8)them was very civil, but attended with
all that embarrassment which(1457,9)proceeding from shyness(169,8)
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior the belief(1684,8)being proud and reserved. Mrs(1303,11)and
her(1827,8)however, did her justice, and pitied her.

By(402,28)(819,11)noticed only by a courtesy; and
(1698,9)being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
others; and between her and(456,14), with occasional help from
(1902,9), the conversation was carried on.(907,11) looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.
(206,10) soon saw that she was herself closely watch(1128,11)(1074,8)
and(58,10)(1721,10)speak a word, especially to(1193,14)ithout
calling her attention. This observation(1649,9)t have prevented her
from try(1516,8)alk(1524,8)latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; bu(282,10)not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
moment that some(1684,8)gentleme(273,8)enter the room: she wished, she
feared, that the mast(801,9) house might be amongst them; and whether
(88,10) or feared it most,(515,11)scarcely determine. After
(1682,8)in this manner a quarter of an hour(542,9) hearing Miss
Bingley’s voice, (716,10)was roused by receiv(1595,9)her a cold
inquiry af(311,8)health(1527,8)family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevit(1857,11)other said no more.

The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from(1557,14)(1015,14) had been
given, to remind her(1916,8)post. T(1237,9)now employment for the whole
party; for though they(1169,11)all talk,(25,12)all eat;(439,8)
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.

While thus engaged(700,12)had a fair opportunity of deciding(902,13)most(897,8)or(917,8)(277,8)appea(554,9)Mr.(1392,8)by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering(1107,9)(291,9)n,(353,8)but
a moment before she had belie(1965,8)wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.

H(78,8)en some time with Mr(1975,13)ho, with two or three other
(1325,10)from(1265,10), wa(395,9) by the river; and had left him
only on learning(1355,10)ladies(1434,8)family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did (446,9), than(1246,12)isely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessa(1737,9)made, but perhaps not(47,9) easily kept, because she
saw(1624,10)suspicion(273,9)whole party were awakened against them,
and(1695,9)re was(1606,10)an eye which(1182,9)watch his behaviour
when he first came into(1818,9). In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss (1670,9), in spit(1949,8)
smile(859,8)overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her(205,8)ons
to(1021,10) were by no means over.(1432,11), on her brother’s(1649,9), exerted herself much more to talk; and(1933,11)(536,9)he
was anxious for his sister(182,8)self to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first(1458,16)saying, with sneering civility,--

“Pray, Miss Eliza, are(883,9)----shire militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”

In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but(1708,10)
instantly comprehended(1470,9)was uppermost in he(1943,8)ts(1901,10)various recollections connected with him gave her (1647,8)’s distress;
but, exerting(671,9)vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably dis(1593,8)tone. While
(977,9), an involuntary glance showed her(917,8)ith a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and(838,12)overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had(1233,13) known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrain(701,8)the hint; but she had mere(1849,12)to discompose
(1798,9), by bringing(1050,8) the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
(837,8)opin(358,8),(1847,8), to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities b(116,8)some part of her family were(801,15)
that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of(1522,11)’s
meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
w(1427,14)xcept to(1553,10); and from all(1857,10)(1010,8)ions
(1662,11) was particularly(1602,9)to conceal it,(597,8)at very wish
which(1677,11)had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable(85,9)might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.
(869,10)’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as(1107,13), vexed and disappointed,(1656,11)approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. H(614,10), whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
(1702,9)ed her interest in the affair(1758,9) very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his(1830,9) from(1906,10), seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.

Their visit did not continue long after(1777,14)and answer above
mentioned; and while Mr.(1737,8)as attending them to their carriage,
(1643,13)was ven(1976,8) feelings in criticisms on(1093,10)’s
person,(664,12)and dress. But(561,11)would not join her. Her
brother’s recommendation was(579,11)ins(1526,8)favour: his judgment
c(95,9)err; and he had spoken in such terms of(466,12)as to leave
(178,11)ithout the power of find(1912,8)otherwise than lovely and
amiable. When Darcy retur(613,8)he saloon,(2035,14)(199,10)help
repeat(1095,9)m(1679,14)wha(1973,10)been say(1140,11)sister.

“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning,(586,10),” she cried: “I
never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agree(1475,9)we
sh(301,10)ave known her again.”

However litt(803,13)might have lik(1593,9)n address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.

“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see
any beauty (927,11) face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy(893,8)r features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,(1557,9)ve sometimes been called so fine,(318,15)(503,8) anything
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not
like at all; and in her air altogether,(301,10)a self-sufficiency
(1222,8)fashion(100,8)is in(305,9).”

Persuaded as(1173,14)was that Darcy admired(1811,12)this was not
the best method of(1499,10)ing herself; but angry people(552,10)lways
wise(248,9)seeing him at last look somewhat nettled,(1298,9)all the
success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a
determination of mak(144,8)speak, she(1996,9)d,--

“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find t(1526,8)was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your(1573,8)one night, after they(1611,10)dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_
a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her(1340,8)pretty at
one time.”

“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain (1492,8)no longer, “but _that_
was only when I(439,15); for it is many month(1771,8)I have
considered her as one(1167,8)(1285,8)st women of my acquaintance.”

He then went away, and(928,18)left to(757,8) satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but(940,8).

Mrs. Gardiner an(1024,11) talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except w(63,8)(708,13)interested them
both. The looks and behaviour of everybody(728,10)seen were discussed,
excep(1573,9)person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
of his sister, his friends, his house(24,8)uit,(166,9)thing but
himself; yet(352,11)was longing to know what (405,14)(803,8)of
him, and(34,15)would have been highly gratified by her niece’s
beginning the subject.

Chapter XLVI.(35,19)(561,10)(1126,9)a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this(91,11)ment(1253,9)
renewed on each(924,8)mornings(715,10)now been spent there; but on
the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on(1092,8)which was marked that
i(221,10) mis-sent elsewhere.(596,15)not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

T(1594,8)just been preparing to walk as the(220,9)came in;(285,8)
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one(258,10)must b(1916,8)attended to; (306,11)
(239,8)five days ago. The (778,10)contained an account(1275,10)eir
little parties and engagements, with such news(281,8)country afforded;
but the latter half,(504,11)dated a day lat(617,8)(436,8)in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--

“Since writ(1043,8)above, dearest Lizzy, something has(1543,10)of a
most unexpected and serious natu(856,8)I am afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. What I have(1769,8)relates to poor Lydia.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
with(992,8)his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
(978,8). To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly(405,11). I am
very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! B(445,8)willing
to hope the best, and that his character has(1210,9)understood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and
let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her(100,8).
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. M(66,9)bears it better. How
thankful am I,(774,9)never let them know what(348,10)said against
him; we must forget it our(1355,11)y were off Saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday(1900,8) at
eight. The(915,9)was sent off directly. My dear(1136,8)they must have
passed within ten miles of us.(934,16) gives us reason to expect
him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, inform(1721,8)of
their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother.(1301,13)you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
(526,10)I have(2015,8).”

Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
w(1251,8)felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
oth(1744,8)opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it

“By this time, my(1769,9)sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
wish this may b(1922,8)ntelligible(1201,8)ough not confined for(128,9)

Lizzy,(538,9)(1064,11)I would write(576,10)ve bad news for you,
and it(697,11)delayed. I(1573,10)s a marriage between Mr.(1724,8)
and o(1295,8)Lydia would be,(2009,8)now anxious to be (2047,8)it has

(1934,11)(1065,18)came(1210,10), having left Brighton the
day before, not many hours after t(1251,10). Though Lydia’s short
letter to Mrs. F. gave them to underst(1865,9)t(1447,9)going to Gretna
Green, something was dropped by Denny(1392,8)ing his belief that W.
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated
to(1406,10)., who(1024,12)taking the alarm, set off from B.,
intending to trace their route. He did(26,10)m easily to Clapham, but
no farther; for on entering that(588,8)they removed into a
hackney-coach, and dis(1759,8)he chaise that brought them from Epsom.
All that is known(540,9)is is,(473,16)seen to continue the
London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible
inquiry on that side of London,(433,11) came on into Hertfordshire,
anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet
and Hatfield, but w(1691,8)ny success,--no such people (1515,9)seen to
pass through. W(1594,8)kindest concern he(214,9)to Longbourn, and
broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most credit(1928,8)his heart.
I am sincerely grieved for him and(998,8); but no one can throw any
bl(168,8)hem. Our distress(1691,9) Lizzy, is very great. My father and
mother believe the worst(1518,8)cannot think so ill of him. Many
circumstances might make it more eligible(1418,8)m to be married
privately in town than to pursu(980,8)first plan; and even if _he_
could form such a design against a young woman of(1377,9)connections,
which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?
Im(839,8)! I grieve to find, however, that(840,12)is not disposed
to depend upon their(1845,9): he shook(595,8)d when I(1603,8)ed my
hop(858,8)said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother
is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it(1981,9)
better, but(1237,8) not to be expected; and as to m(680,8), I (1653,8)
my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for(1949,8)concealed
their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,(906,8)not
wonder. I am truly glad, dearest(895,8)that you have been spared
(1927,10)of these(965,9)ing scenes(1029,8)w, as the first shock is
over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,
(669,9)as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen
again to do, what I have just told you I would not; but (1091,13)
are such,(200,8)cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as
soon as(1755,9)(1810,9)(1310,8)uncle and aunt so well(118,9)am not
afraid of requesting it, though(226,8)still (465,10)more to ask of
the former(1408,12)is going to London with(1893,10)orster instantly,
to try to discover her. What he means(387,8)I am sure(251,8)(370,8)
his excessiv(629,10) will not allow him(1415,11)any measure in the
best and safest way, and(194,18)s obliged to be at Brighto(567,10)-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and
assistance(1138,9)(1435,11) in(1753,8)ld; he will immediately
comprehend(697,8)must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”

“Oh! where, where is(169,9)?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to fo(418,8), without losing a
moment of the time so precious(1259,9)she reac(108,8)door, it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and
impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself
enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by(2021,8)
situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, bu(516,9)leave you.
(534,8)ind Mr. Gardiner this (375,8)n business that(1216,8)be delayed;
I have not an(992,8) to lose.”

“Good God! what is the matter(595,9)he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting(354,8), “I(1013,10)detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the(531,10)go after Mr. and Mrs(281,10). You are
not well enough; you(1498,8)go yourself.”

(809,9) hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
littl(1041,11)gained by her attempting(1252,11)them. Calling back
(238,13)therefore, she commissioned him(1558,9)in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
m(1448,8)home(1558,10).

On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably i(1813,9)it was im(1876,8) for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one?(694,8) very ill.”

“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to(1230,10)erself. “There
is(184,9)(979,10) with me. I am quite well, I am only(1960,9)ed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”

She burst into tears(1559,8)alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
some(1962,8)distinctly of his

[Illustration:

     “(1348,29)”
]

concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke
again.(113,9)just had a letter from Jan(1422,8)such(410,14). It
(1544,10)conceal(407,8)anyone. My youngest sister has left all her
friends--has eloped; has thrown(976,8) into the power of--of Mr.
Wickham. They are gone off togeth(210,8)Brighton. _You_ know him too
well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,(765,11)at
can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”

Darcy was fixed in astonishment.

“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_
might have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained
some part of it only--(22,13)what I learnt, to my own family! Had
his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,
all too late now.”

“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shock(91,9)s it
certain, absolutely certain?”

“Oh, yes! They left(597,9)(620,10)on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond: t(714,8)certainly not gone to
Scotland.”

“And what has been done,(20,15)attempted,(1483,15)?”

“My father has(103,8)(158,9)and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s
immediate assistance(253,8) shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But
(1797,8)can be done; I know very well that(1840,9)(43,11). How is
such a man to be worked on? How are they ev(207,8) discovered? I have
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!(986,9)shook his head in silent acquiescence(998,9)_my_ eyes were opened to his real(821,10), oh! had I known what
I ought,(903,8)dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much. Wretched,(1773,10)mistak(225,11)made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon(1825,8)d, and(1872,8)ly understood it. Her power
was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She(1270,8)either
wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brough(790,9)
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her(355,8)and her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that s(279,9)have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.

But self, though it would intrude,(1643,11)engross her. Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
(730,10)was soon lost to(680,12)else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense(521,8)situation by the
voic(30,9)companion, who, in a manner which(380,12)spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--(2001,8)afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything
to plead in excuse of my stay, but real(557,9)unavailing concern.
Would to Heaven that(98,9) could be either said or done on my part,
that might offer (934,8)ion to such(898,9)(1465,8)will not torment
you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the
pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”

“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”

He readily assured her(1425,10)crecy, again expressed his sorrow for
(1383,12), wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with
only one serious parting look, went away.

As he quitted(1973,9),(1914,11)felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their (1246,9)eetings in Derbyshi(1389,8)as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whol(1972,8)ir acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection(484,11)’s
change of sentiment will be neither(513,12)nor faulty. But if
otherwise, if the regard sp(1877,8)from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words(1684,10)
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method,(84,8)partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example(444,9)Lydia’s infamy must
produce, found additional anguish(1001,8)reflected on that wretched
(1593,8). Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a
hope of(369,8)’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of all her (1109,9)on this development. While the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,
that(649,8) should marry a girl whom(1563,8)im(1917,8) he c(45,10)
for money; and how Lydia c(1603,10)have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. But now(1689,8)all too natural. For(378,9)(737,10)
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage,(1093,9)no difficulty in believing that(1442,8)
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.

S(128,8)ever perceived, w(625,9)regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any(1243,16)him; but(648,9)convinced t(1075,9) had
wanted only encouragement to attach(876,9)to anybody. Sometimes one
officer, s(23,9)another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them(1545,8)opinion. Her(1897,10)s(87,10)(2032,8)lly
fluctuating, but never(534,9)an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
feel it!

She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance(984,13)almost persuad(640,8)nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed(1418,8)utmost
importance, and till (1671,8)ed the room the misery of her impatience
was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but
satisfying(784,8)stantly(1962,9)head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons,(1990,9)the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript(1800,8)last with trembling energy. Though(1129,10) never
been a(1031,10) with them,(372,23)could not but be
deeply affected. No(1233,8)only, but all were concerned in it; and after
(1995,9) exclamations of(1970,9) and horror, Mr(522,11)readily
promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth,(1777,8)expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily
settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be
done about Pemberley?” crie(850,15). “John told us Mr. Darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?”

“Yes; and I told him we sh(573,10)e able to keep our engagement.
_That_ is all (263,8)”

“What(24,15)?” repe(870,8) other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”

But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion(1401,8)following hour. Had(740,10) been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
im(628,8) to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
(1693,8), meanwhile, having(711,8) hi(1669,9) at the inn,(1927,9)(389,9)to(1933,9)but to go; an(477,11), after(248,8)(1871,10)
the morning, found(404,8), in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.

CHAPTER XLVII.(90,16)]

“I have been thinking it over again,(1538,11)” said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man(1401,8)form
such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying(1905,8)Colonel’s family(1321,8)
am strongly(284,11)o hope the best. Could he expect that he(991,9)
w(1620,9)step forward?(57,18)o be noticed again by the
regiment(844,8)such an affront to(199,8) Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk.”

“Do you really think so(1926,9)(975,11)brightening up for a moment.

“Upon my word(699,8)(1988,13), “I begin to be of your uncle’s
opinion. It is(147,9)oo great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot(240,9) very ill of
Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?”

“Not perhaps of neglecting his own (197,8). But of every other(48,8)
I can(107,8) (107,11). If, indeed, it(869,8)be so! But I dare not
hope it. Why(911,8)they not go on to Scotland, if that had(1224,8)e
case?”

“In t(1337,11)ace,” replied Mr(525,13)there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone(137,12).”

“Oh, but their removing(1304,10)chaise into a hackney coach is such a
presumption! And, besides, no trac(1261,9)m were to be fou(1628,9)
Barnet road.”

“Well, then,--supposing the(658,8)in London--they may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionabl(50,9). It(1028,8)(1415,12)mone(496,9)be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them (425,10)c(612,8)more economically(205,8) less
expeditiously, married(270,10), than in(491,14)But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is (301,10). His most particula(1643,8), you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give(432,8) was going(148,8) in his family, that _he_ would
do as(107,9)nd think(20,12)bout it, as an(198,8) could do, in
such a matter(1065,9)can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on an(1938,8)terms than (1123,8)?”

“It does seem, and it (1103,8)shocking(1962,9)(1832,10)Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such
a point(2022,8)admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps(824,10)doing her justi(762,8)she is very young: she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and (1800,8)last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth,(108,9)been given up to (973,8)but amusement
and vanity. S(59,12)allowed to dis(1923,8)her tim(1150,9)most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came(479,8)way.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton,(218,13)love,
flirtation, and officers, have been(598,8)head(251,15)doing
(804,11)in her power, by thinking and talking on the(447,8),(1065,8)
greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which
are naturally lively enough. And we all know that(1878,9)(1217,8)y
charm of person and addres(400,9)n captivate(1918,8)(1117,9)(2037,8)that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of
Wickham, as to believe him capable(1639,8)attempt.”

“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would(146,9)(142,11)such an(146,8),
till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what(269,8) really is. We both(448,11)(969,12)profligate in every
(1273,9)the word;(56,13)neither integrity nor honour(42,10)is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”

“And do you(192,8)know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mod(1117,9)intelligence was all alive.

“I do(1591,30)colouring. “I told you the other day
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spok(730,9)man who had behaved with
such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which(1705,10)at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew(585,8)contrary himself. He
must(1302,11)she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her(1286,9)does Lydia know(1880,9)of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?”

“Oh, yes!--tha(1200,8)is(1007,8)st of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of(735,10) and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
(201,12)the truth myself. And when I returned hom(1993,15)
was to leave(1982,8) in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the
case,(1244,9)Jane, to whom I related(684,10), nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for(440,9)use could it
apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it
was settled that Lydia(67,8)go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as _this_(279,8)ensue, you may easily(1974,9)was far
enough from my(503,8)s.”

“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to(123,9)them fond of each other?”

“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had any(1136,11)e kind been perceptibl(295,8)ust be aware
that ours(1531,8)a(1471,8)on (1559,9)could be thrown away. When first
he(452,9)the corps,(1366,9)ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. Every girl in or near(1052,9)was out of her sens(1679,9)him for
the first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
attention; and, (653,9)tly, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others(1371,8)regiment,
who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”

It may be(819,15)d, that however little of novelty(524,10)added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
(1509,9)(1685,8)journey. From Elizabeth’s(1031,9) it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keene(1890,9) anguish, self-reproach, she could
find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort
to(301,10) to consider that Jan(1788,8)not have been wearied by long
expectations.

The(596,8)Gardiners, attracted(362,8)sight of a chaise, were standing
on the step(804,9)house, as they(1169,13)paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was (1226,10)pleasing ear(647,8)their welcome.

(434,10)jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from
her mother’s apartment, immediately met her(185,12), as she(1781,10)ately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether(1850,10)had been
heard(1865,8)fugitives.

“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
everything will be well.”

“Is my father in town?”

“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”

“And have you heard from him often?”

“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
(1908,10)ly begged him to do. He merely add(1702,10)e sh(1157,9)write
again, till(150,8)something of importance to mention(309,9)my mother--how is she? How are you all?”

“M(43,8) is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven! are quit(667,11)But you--h(266,10)?” cried(1877,10). “You look pale. How much you
must have gone through!”

Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation(604,8)(985,8) passing while Mr. and Mrs.(1676,9) were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to(1720,8)approach of
the whole party. Jane ran to he(1057,8)and aunt, and(1483,8)d and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

When they were all in the draw(515,8), the questions which(2033,10)
had already asked were of course repea(1970,11)othe(696,8)they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence(1053,8). The sanguine hope of good,
(532,9)which the benevolence(542,8)heart suggested, had(780,8)
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well(214,8)at
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.

Mrs. Bennet, to whose(1899,10) they all repaired, after a few minutes’(821,13) together, receiv(639,8)exactly as might be(315,9); with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints(1035,8)own sufferings and ill-usage;
blaming everybody but the person(304,10)ill-judging indulgence the
error(113,9)daughter must be principally owing.

“If I(1139,10)able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton
with all my family, _this_ w(1777,9)have happened: but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take car(818,8). Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? I am sure there was som(1707,8)neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after. I always thought(1289,11)very unfit to have
the charg(1090,8); but I was over-ruled, as(90,10)am. Poor, dear
child! And now here’s Mr(922,8) gone away, and I know he will fight
(747,9)wherever he meets him(1365,9)n(55,9)be killed, and what is
to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what
we shall do.”

T(1169,8)exclaimed(1031,9)such terrific ideas; and Mr(1950,10), after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her(841,9)told her
that he meant to be in London the very next d(450,8)would assist Mr.
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.

“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It(903,8)quite a week since they left(1180,9). In a few days more, we
may gain some news of them; and till we know tha(1698,8)re not married,
and have no design of marrying,(615,8)let us giv(1818,8)tter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my(713,10)and make him
come home with me to Gracechurch Street(932,11)we may consult
(1873,8) as to(939,8) to be done.”

“Oh, my dear(850,9)” replied (2026,13)“that is(1939,9)what I
could most wish for.(1176,9)do, when you(264,14)find them out,
(1154,9)they may b(1028,10)(432,20) already, _make_ them
marry. And as for wedding clothes(455,13)them wait for that, but
tell Lydia sh(1100,8)have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
aft(206,8)are(614,8). And, above all things, keep(1471,12)from
fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened
out of my wits; (745,9)such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pain(22,8)head, and such beatings at my
heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell(683,8)
Lydia not to give any directions about her(504,8) till she has seen me,
for she does(1605,12)ich are the best warehouses. Oh(1663,11)how
kind(1705,8)!(1899,8)you will contrive it all.”

But(1634,15)though he assured her again(1637,8)earnest(1512,10)s
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table,(1483,11)her to vent(1821,10)eelings on the
housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.

T(325,8)(1229,9) and sister were persuaded(1546,9)re was no real
(1721,9)for such a seclusion from the(2004,10)hey did not attempt to
oppose it;(1830,8)y knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at(371,8)and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household(1612,9) one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend(462,11)ars and solicitude(474,8)subject.

In the dining-ro(106,8)were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engag(550,9)ir separate apartments to make their appearance
before. One came from her books(283,11)ther(30,10)toilette. The
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
in either, except(684,9) loss(762,8)favourite sister, or the anger
which(618,9)herself incurr(846,10)business, had given something more
of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was
mistress(745,8)of(150,9)to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon(1193,8)(586,10)ea(791,13)--

“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malic(1818,8)our into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”

Then perceiving in(304,10) no inclination of replying, she added,
“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson:--that(669,9)virtue in a female is irretriev(1558,8)at one
false step involves(1632,8)endless ruin, that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful(1243,8)at she cannot be too much guarded(1804,8)behaviour towards the undeserving(1342,8)other sex.”

(393,10)lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was(129,10)oppressed to
make any reply. Mary(1104,11)continued to console(994,9)with such
kind of moral extractions(1735,10)evil(1631,11)m(1437,10)afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to(572,8)half an
hour by themselves; and(687,11)instantly availe(1191,10)of the
opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which(891,11)considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former(504,10)
the subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I
have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything(627,11) elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”

“Colonel (138,8)did own(1076,8) had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
grieved for him. His(1105,11)was attentive and kind(1868,8)utmost. He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern,(977,8)he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that(445,13)
first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”

“And was Denny convinced that Wickham w(771,9)marry? Did he know of
their intend(375,8)o off? Ha(637,9)(499,9)seen Denny himself?”

“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing(683,10)(138,9)plan, and(186,11)give his real opinion(871,9). He did not
repeat his persua(789,8)(404,10)marrying, and from _that_ I am
inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before(403,9)till(312,17)came(306,8), not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose,(595,10)being really married?”

“How was it (1236,8) that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew that(836,8)duct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew(1063,9)of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on(693,9)more than the rest of us, that i(1238,10)last letter
she had prepared (1375,8)such a step. She had known, it seems(516,10)
being in love with each other many weeks.”

“But not(1546,11)y went to Brighton?”

“No, I believe not(1122,9)(1667,11)(1529,9)appear to think ill of(1140,9)(1050,8) Does he
know(961,10)character?”

“I must confess(1612,9)did not speak so we(101,14)as (1972,9)ly
did. He(195,8)d him to be (519,11)nd extravagant; and since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said(1776,9)left Meryton greatly in debt:
but I hope this may be false.”

“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret(25,9)told what we knew of him,
this c(1508,9)have happened!”

“Perhaps it would(1222,11)better,” replied her sister.

“But to expose t(365,9) faults of any person, without(1499,9)what(1492,8)resent feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”

“We acted with the best intentions.”

“Coul(1697,18)repeat the particulars of(917,9)note to his
wife?”

“He brought it(1230,10)for us to see.”

Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents:--

     /* NIND “My dear Harriet, */

     “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
     missed.(115,8)ing to Gretna Green, and if you(137,8)gu(1593,8)
     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world I love, and he is an angel. I(1803,8)never be happy(708,8)
     him, s(1251,9)t no har(1110,8)off. You need not send them word at
     Longbourn of my going,(269,8)do not like it, for it will make(215,10)(407,10)he greater when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia
    (1445,8). What a good joke(119,9)be! I can hardly write for(568,14). Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing(886,10)to-night. Tell him(1353,8)he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and t(62,10)will dance(989,10)(417,8)the next ball we meet with great pleasure.(671,9)send for(212,9)clothes(400,8)get to(507,10); but I wish you would tell Sally to

“Your affectionate friend,

“LYDIA BENNET.”


“Oh, thoughtless(13,13) Lydia!” cried(1323,10) when she had
finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But
at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her(258,10)Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”

“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!”

“Oh, Jane,(478,17), “was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know(120,11)story(773,11) end of the day?”

“I(1376,8)know:(1094,8)there was. But to be guarded(566,11)time is
very difficult(292,16)in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I (253,8)do so much
as I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties.”(995,9)ttendance upon her has been too much for you. Y(1747,11)ook
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.”

“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure, but(379,11)think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies(458,8) that her hours of
repose sh(949,9)be broken in on. My aunt Philips came(1645,13) on
Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to u(1921,11)Lady
Lucas(564,10)(410,9): she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any(1454,8)daughters, if
they could be of use to us.”

“She had better have stayed at hom(1222,19): “perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under(1672,9)isfortune a(1716,8)one cannot see too
little of one’s neighbours. A(1078,11)s impossible; condolence,
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”

She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which he(1727,8) had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his(451,9).

“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could
be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
numb(1095,9) hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be
remarked, he meant to make inquiries at(196,11)f he could anyhow
(286,9)at what house the coachman had(2038,8)set down his fare, he
determined(129,19)there, and hoped i(1828,8)not be(851,11)
to find out the stand and (441,14)coach. I(1786,8)know of any
other designs(1521,8) had formed; but he was in(1066,8)hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed,(1897,12)difficulty in finding
out even(1670,9)as this.”

CHAPTER XLVIII.(54,16)]

The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but(920,9) came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at(1507,8)time they ha(611,8)for exertion.
They were forced to conclude,(546,13)no pleasing intelligence to
send; b(460,8)of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only(1423,9)letters(881,8)he set off.

When(698,8)gone, t(219,9)certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going (1220,8)their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on(590,13)o return to Longbourn as soon as(1155,9), to
the great consol(154,9)his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.

Mrs. (400,9)and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer,(150,8)former(1539,9)her presence(1469,9) serviceable to
her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs(959,8), and was a
(329,8)mfort to them(68,10)hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited(1798,8)equently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up--though(73,9)never came(1130,8)
reporting some fresh in(1865,10)Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away(1232,9)leav(153,9)more dispirited than she found
them.

All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who(1364,8)ree months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declare(1112,8)in debt
to every tradesman in the plac(1915,8)is intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction(159,11)extended in(114,18)’(1523,8).
Everybody(176,11)ha(1906,9)the wickedest young (179,11)world; and
e(73,9)began to find out that(1525,10)always distrusted the
appear(556,8)his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half(1323,13)said, believed enough to make her(1025,8)assu(128,8)
her sister’s ruin still mo(1469,10); and even Jane, who(105,10)still
less of it, became(569,8)hopeless, more especially(1326,8)time was now
come, when, if(1857,10)gone to Scotland, which s(1827,8)ever before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.

Mr(1430,11)left(1606,11)on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.
That(1830,12)(1013,9)to Epsom and Clapham,(2045,9)(157,10), but
(1204,8)gaining any satisfactory (2015,11)(1994,8)(891,10)now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as(2024,11)
(1758,8)it possible they might have(588,9)one(481,8), o(1747,8)first
coming to London(253,9)they procured lodgings. (544,13)himself
(954,8)expect any success from this measure; but as(467,12) was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.
Bennet(1561,8)wholly disinclined at present to leave(253,9)and
promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this
effect:--

“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire(719,8)(1388,8), if
(483,8), from som(466,8)(1475,10)’s intimates(1666,8)regiment,
whether(1972,8) has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part(136,8)town he has now concealed(549,8). If there
were anyone(1034,8)e could apply to, with a(1212,13)of(891,9)such
a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. A(512,10)we have
nothing to guide us.(419,17)will, I dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps
Lizzy could tell us what(430,11)(362,11)living better than any
other person.”

(1908,9) was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her(269,10)give any
(1315,11) of s(296,8)actory a nature(1845,8)compliment deserved.

S(1806,13)heard of his having had(736,14), except a father
and mother, both of whom(1566,10)dead many years. It was(1394,9),
however, that(920,9)his companion(909,9)----shire(677,10)able to
give more(1602,20)ough s(1605,9)t very sanguine in expecting
it, the application was a some(741,9)look forward to.

Every day a(2034,12)was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
(1041,8)each was when the post was expected. The(2044,9)of letters was
the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through(74,8),
whatever of good or bad was to be told(1255,10)communicated; and every
succeeding day(199,13) to bring some news of importance.

But(1878,13)heard again from(1876,13), a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quart(26,9)Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received dir(1520,8)to open all that came for(1912,8)his absence,
she accordingly read; and (1127,9), who knew what curiosities his
(496,8)always were, looked over her, and read it likewise(904,9)as
follows:--

     /* “My dear Sir, */

     “I feel myself called upon, by our(1806,10)hip, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by(544,9)
     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear si(1190,8)Mrs(543,9) and
    (278,8)sincerely sympathiz(223,10), and all your respectable
     family, in your(1895,9)distress, which mus(1956,8)the bitterest
     kind, because(1635,8)ing(758,8)cause which no time can remove. No
     arguments shall be wanting on my part,(749,8)n alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
    (245,8), of all others, most(552,9)ng to a parent’s mind. The
     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of
     this. And it is the more to be lamente(391,11)there is reason to(709,8)ppose, as(619,9)Charlott(1742,8)s me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour(576,8)

“To whom I have related the affair”(58,8)_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

    (331,10)has(628,8)ed(1385,8)faulty degree of indulgence; though,
     at the same time, for the consolation(449,8)self and Mrs. Bennet,
     I am inclined to think that her own disposition(851,9)naturally
     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an
     age. Howsoeve(770,11)be,(1242,9)(1270,8)ly to be pitied; in
     which opinion I am not only joined by(1184,13), bu(1529,10) by
     Lady Catherine and he(784,10), t(547,32).
     They agree with me in apprehending(696,11)false step in on(916,8)(902,9)ill be injurious to the fortunes(1019,8)the others: for(285,8)o, as(220,16)herself condescendingly says, will connect(986,8)emselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,
     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certa(494,8)event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must(1225,10)(1906,8)volved in(1661,10)sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then(214,8)(1803,13)o console(907,11)s much as possible, to throw off
     your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her(1340,9)reap the fruits of(987,9)heinous offence.

“I am,(1996,10)” etc., etc.

Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then(57,8)nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up
any(733,8)ion, and it was(618,8)(1297,8) had no near one living. His
former acquaintance had been numerous; but since(295,8)been in the
militia, it(352,9)appear(131,9)was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out
as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own
finances, t(136,9)a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by Lydia’s(490,9)s; for it had just transpired
(463,12)left gaming debts behind him to(166,8)(1225,9)ble amount.(714,16) believed that more than a thousand pounds would be
necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal(570,8)town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. (981,12)
(629,9)ttempt to conceal these(623,11)s from the Longbourn family;
Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly
unexpected; I(1051,8) an idea of it.”(1175,15)added, in his letter,(1887,8)ey might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill succes(1943,12)ir endeavours,(1328,8)yielded(744,8)brother-in-law’s entreaty(1035,10)ould return to his family and
leave it to(717,8)do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much(2013,13) as her children (508,8),(893,9)ing
what her anxiety for his lif(1393,11)before.

“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?(658,14)Sure he
will not leave Londo(102,8) he has found them. Who is to figh(1688,9),
and make him marry her, if he comes away?”

As Mrs(1908,11)began to wish(427,8)t home,(1716,8)settl(1156,8)she
and(345,14)should go to(202,8)at the same time that Mr(473,8)
came from it. The coach(1607,13)took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to(1107,10).

(260,14)went away in(849,8) perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend, that had attended her(1239,8)at part of the world.
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned(544,8)them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which(511,15)had formed, of
their being followed by a lett(202,8)him, had ended in nothing.
(293,10)had received none since her return, that could come from
Pemberley.

The present unhappy stat(511,8)(1181,8)rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits un(1839,9);(198,8)(641,13)c(1879,8)fairly conjectured from _that_,--though(551,10), who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she know(388,9) of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It w(65,10)spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.

When(1019,11) arrived(1705,9)(885,8)appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as(1788,8)(841,10)in the
habit of saying; made no(861,8)(919,8)business(972,10)taken him
away; and(1307,9)o(1246,8)(1465,8)is daughters had courage to speak of
it.

It was not ti(257,8)fternoon, when he joined them at tea, that(876,11)ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say
(637,11)that. Who(1558,8)suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it.”

“You must not be too severe upon yourself,”(157,8)(1460,10).(64,8)ay well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to
fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough.”

“Do you suppose them to be in London?”

“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”

“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.

“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there
will probably be of some duration.”

Then, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no
ill-will fo(1815,8)justified in your advice to me last May, which,
considering the event, shows some great(1693,8)mind.”

They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s
tea.

“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives(792,8)
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same;(20,8)sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
I can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”

“(878,9)going to run away, papa(656,8)Kitty, fretfully. “If _I_
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”

“_You_(59,15)!(59,9)not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,
for fifty pounds! No,(183,8)I have at least learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are
n(164,8)stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner.”

Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

“Well, well(1303,10), “do not make(1769,9) unhappy. If(250,8) a good
girl for the next ten years,(937,8)take you to a review at the end of
them.”

CHAPTER XLIX.(35,19)Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane an(1967,11) were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw(20,10)keeper
coming towards them, and concluding that she(1364,9)call(1844,9)their
mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to(1517,14)“I beg your pardon,
madam, for(1576,10)ing you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of (332,9) ask.”

“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing(100,10).”

“Dear madam(1689,9)Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half hour, and(63,8)has had a letter.”

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran(1318,14)estibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the(1882,8);--their father(512,8)neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him upstairs with their (767,9)(704,9)were met by the
butler, who said,--

“(1186,11)looking for my master, ma’am, he is(1019,8)(943,12)
little copse.”

Upon this information, they instantly passed(1669,13)hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after (333,12), who was deliberately
pursuing his way(1126,9)a small wood on one side(1048,8)paddock.

Jane(94,10)not so(1571,8)nor so much(1283,8)habit of running as
(1342,9), soon lagged behind, while he(1842,8), pant(393,8)breath,
came(1895,9)him, and eagerly cried out,--

“Oh, papa, what news?(11,11) have you heard from my uncle?”

“Yes, I have(859,13) from him by(975,8).”(1822,9)and(114,10) does it bring--good or bad?(1179,9)is there of good to b(1432,10)?(1899,11)taking the(141,12)
his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”
(404,10) impatiently caught it(232,8)s hand. Jane now came up.

“Read it aloud,” said(661,15)“for I hardly know myself what it is
about.”

     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August 2_. */

“My dear Brother,

     “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after
     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what

     to town again; therefore stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend(1337,9)my diligence and care. Send back(765,12) as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my
     niece should b(1726,9)(852,8)is house, of(1561,10)ope you(427,11)approve. She comes to us to-day(1053,10)write again(221,11)(212,8)ything more is determined on. Yours, etc.

“EDW. GARDINER.”

“Is it possible?(1953,8)(1921,9), when she had finished. “Can it be
(62,8) that he will marry her?”

“Wickham is(1081,8)undeserving, then, as we have(1341,9)him,” said her
sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”

“And have you answered the letter?” sai(240,11).

“No; but it must be done soon.”

Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time(2014,8)he
wrote.

“Oh! m(208,14)” she cried, “come back and write(1001,12).
Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”

“Let me write(1687,8)(369,8)Jane, “if you dislike the trouble
(2018,8).”

“I(35,9)it very much,” he replied; “(345,19).”

And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

“And--may I ask(480,17); “but the terms, I suppose,(494,8)
complied with.”

“C(18,12)! I am only ashamed of his asking so little(645,9)they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.”

“Yes, yes, they must marry(1423,8)is nothing else to(333,9) But there
are two things that I wan(416,11) to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever
to pay him.”

“Money! my uncle!(1148,8)Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”

“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight
a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.”

“That is very true(1210,8)(638,12)though it had not occurred to me
before. His debts(477,8)ischarged, and something still to remain! Oh,
(1213,11)(354,8)’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”

“No(1463,11) father. (1543,8)’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds: I(1927,11)sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship.”

“T(109,18)! Heaven forbid! How is half(1367,8)sum to be
repaid?”

Mr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in(1791,8), continued
silent till they reached(1279,11) Thei(1812,8) then went to the
library to write,(943,9)girls(1367,8)into the breakfast-room.(1226,12)are really to be married(965,9)(1873,9), as soon as they
were by themselves. “How strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be
thankful. That they(524,8)marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character,(120,8)forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”

“I comfort myself(1719,8)inking,”(1798,8)(1881,8)that he certainly would
not(1206,12), if he(1072,9)a real regard for her. Though our kind
(1458,10)done(1071,11)(1847,8)clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
(885,15), or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half(1017,13)
pounds?”

“If(530,8)ever able to learn what (1134,10)debts have been,” said
(678,11)“and(1786,10)is settled on his side on our sis(537,8)shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner(389,10)for them, because(163,8) has
not sixpe(677,8)is own. The kindness of(1843,9) and aunt can never be
requited(1040,8)taking her home, and afford(24,8)their personal
protection and countenance, is(1262,9)acrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude(610,8)enough acknowledge. By this time she is
actually(840,8)em! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting(852,8), when she
first sees my aunt!”

“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side(646,8)Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet(174,9). His consenting to marry
her is a proof, I will(977,8), (1136,8)is come to a right way of
(1196,8)(1610,8)mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
(186,10)settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make(674,8)ast imprudence forgotten.”

“Their conduct(1170,10)such(1406,11)(1013,13)s neither you, nor
I, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”

It now occurred to(1892,11)that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They(2022,12) library,
therefor(1009,8)sked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly
replied,--

“Just as you please.”

“May we take(1254,9)’s letter to read to her?”

“Take whatever you like, and get away.”
(1514,10) took the(85,8)from hi(207,9)-table, and t(349,9)upstairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, (420,11)do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
(201,11)was read aloud.(130,12)(1880,8)ardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read(1734,13)’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,
her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know(1315,8)r daughter
would be(226,8) was enough(162,10)disturbed by no fear(1606,8)
felicity, nor humbled by any remembra(2035,8)er misconduct.

“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is(258,8)ful indeed! She will
(192,10)! I shall see her again(44,10)(236,12)at sixteen! My
good, kind brother! I knew how it (302,8)--(24,8)(1115,8)manage
everything. How I long to(143,8)! and(16,8)dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes!(1786,8)write to my sister(718,9) about
them directly. Lizzy, m(372,8)run down to you(1337,8)(1361,9) him how
much (321,8)give her. Stay, stay(1934,9)go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill.(1984,8)put on my things in a moment. (544,13)
Lydia! How merry we shall be (1211,8) when we meet!”

Her eldest(760,9) endeavoured to give some relief(1750,8)violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts(1811,8)obligations which Mr.
(1137,11)behaviour laid them all under.

“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded(1055,8) has pledged himself to
assist Mr.(693,9)with money.”

“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything(1876,8)m except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.
In a short time,(1193,9)have a(667,10)marrie(1762,8)Wickham! How well
it sounds! And she was only(1231,8) last June(834,9) Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so(1140,8)dictate, and you
write for me. We will settle with(1114,12) about the money
afterwards; but the(1031,8)sh(1691,8)ordered immediately.”

(1856,8)then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have(241,8)d some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty,(878,11)her to wait till her
father was at lei(955,8)be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,(2006,10)of small importance; an(925,12) was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.

“(1557,10)to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news(1780,14)Philips. And as I come back, I can call on
Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty(1810,11)and order the carriage. An
airing w(1207,8)me(1387,8) deal of good,(847,10). Girls, can I do
(1099,10)or you in(288,8)? Oh! here comes Hill(967,10)Hill, have you
heard the(286,10)? Miss Lydia is going to be(1116,8);(959,8) shall
(1159,11)bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”

Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in (1600,8)room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s
situation must, at best, be bad enough(1198,8)at it was no worse, she
had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,
neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity c(1336,8)justly
expected for her sister(112,13)back to what they had feared, only
two hours ago, s(201,8)(1388,8)advantages of(73,15)gained.

“The spiteful old ladies”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]




CHAPTER L.(97,16)]

Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision(112,8)children, an(133,9)wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchas(641,10). The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to
be her husband(1013,9)en have rested in its proper place.

He was seriously concerned that a cause of so littl(759,11) to anyone
sh(1920,8)forwarded at the sole expense(613,8)brother-in-law(1952,8)
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent(695,8)assistance,
and to discharge the obligation (1922,11)he could.

When first (832,15)married, economy was hel(1260,8)perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to(1656,8)son. This son was to join
in cutting off the entail,(188,15)(375,10)of age(1592,9) widow
and younger(873,9) would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but ye(497,8)(206,9)come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years afte(1679,9) birth, had been certain that he
would. This event had at last been despaired of, bu(1715,9)then too
late to be saving. Mrs(1334,13)no turn for(505,8)(681,8)r
husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on(184,13)and
the(1365,9). But in what proportions it(573,11)divided amongst the
latter depended on the will(1191,8)parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia at least, which was now(394,8)ettled, and(900,11)
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal(1762,8)him. In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness(1195,15), though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his(1062,8)
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that(814,10)made for (1837,8)had never(2036,8)supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his(1039,9), it(1094,8)e
done with(1571,11)inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten(784,8)a year the loser, by the
hundr(1718,8)was(1434,8)aid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowanc(1352,11)continual(177,8)s in money which passed to her
through her mother’s hands,(1250,9)expenses(1252,10)very(1887,8)within
that sum.

That(371,12) (371,11)uch trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at(424,8)(1696,8)have
as(489,8)trouble in the business as(1978,9). When the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking(232,9), he was quick in
its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was
indebted to(1155,12); bu(733,8)o angry with Lydia to send any
message to her.

The good news quickly spread (692,8)the house; and with(1588,11)ate
spee(48,14)neighbourhood. It was born(533,9)latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure(1112,11)have been more(1437,9)advantage of
conversation, had Miss Lydia(1993,8)come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant
farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her;(1130,8)
good-natured wishes for her well-doing(1850,8)had proceeded(1773,8)from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but(1460,8)of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, becaus(1161,12)a husband her misery
was considered certain.

It was a fortnight since Mrs(2044,8)(1753,10)down stairs, but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp(1529,9)riumph. The marriage of a(1848,11)(1256,10)be(1300,13)object of
her(510,8)since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, (393,8)thoughts(17,9)words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching(1087,26) for a
proper situation(774,9)(328,8); and, without knowing or(616,9)ing
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larg(1532,8)Ashworth is
too far off. I could not bear(1962,8) her ten miles from me; and as for
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”

Her(991,9)allowed her to talk on(402,9)interruption while the(540,9) remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.
Bennet,(1268,8)you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
(916,10)let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
(706,14)they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”

A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr(1371,9)was firm: it
soon led to anot(1691,9)(1421,12)fou(889,8) amazement and horror,
that h(554,11)w(664,9)advance a guinea to buy clot(1772,9)is(410,9). He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever(1324,8)occasion.(1637,13)could hardly comprehend
it. That his anger could be carried to(1788,8)(1416,8) inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his(1562,9) a privilege(1241,10)which her
(1616,9)would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all(302,10)(176,8)lieve
possible(1438,10)more alive to the disgrace(1710,9)er want of new
(432,8)must reflect on(1442,13)’s(1588,11)than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight(1015,8)they
took place.

Elizabeth(1824,9)most heartily sorry(583,10)had, from(245,8)tress of
the moment, bee(791,9)make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her (462,16)o shortly give the proper
termination(415,8)elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.

She had no fear of its spreading farther,(2015,9)his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy sh(737,8)have more confidently depended;
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s
frailty(114,15)tified her so much. Not, however, from any(264,8)
disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there
seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s(582,10)been
concluded(1258,8)most hon(513,8)terms, it was not to be supposed that
(735,10)would connect himself with a family, where to every other
obj(1406,8)ould now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest
kin(860,10) man whom he so justly scorned.

From(1419,8)connection(1285,11)not wonder that (1612,10)shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard(1299,8)she had assured(477,8) of his
feeling in Derbyshire,(134,11)in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this(1458,10)humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, whe(320,14)
longer(1134,9)be benefited by it(1625,8)nted to hear of hi(80,8)(752,13)the least chance of gaining intelligenc(1712,11)convinc(688,8)(1763,10)have been happy with(119,11)(760,9) longer likely they
should meet.

What a triumph for him, as she often thought(470,8)he know that the
proposals(563,15)proudly spurned only four months ago(824,10)
(214,10)gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as(1052,10)(39,8)(502,8)sex. But while he was mortal,
there must be(286,10).

She began now to comprehend(872,9)was exactly(972,12), in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper(756,9)unlike her own(74,8)have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must(602,11)to the (1518,10)of both: by her ease
and liveliness, his mind(1963,8)(681,9)softened, his manners improved;
and from his judgment, information, and(1762,14)the world, she must
have(555,9)(947,8) of greater importance.

But no such happy(1643,10)(1353,8)w teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. A(361,8)of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility(1581,8)other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

How Wickham and Lydia wer(1233,8)supported in tolerable independence she
(1486,11)magine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to
a couple who were only brought together because their passions were
stronger than their virtue,(1793,11)easily conjecture.

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s
ac(636,8)ments he briefly replied, with assurance(1637,10)agerness to
promote the welfare of any(1684,8)family; and concluded with entreaties
(1407,8) subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
purport(1807,8)letter was to inform them, that Mr.(595,9)had resolved
on quitt(702,8)militia.

“It was greatly my wish(1328,9)should do so,” he added, “(743,8)as his
(922,9)was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his
account and my niece’s. It is(287,12)’s intention to go into the
Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are
able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
ensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quarter(1128,9) north. It is
an(1577,11)to have it so far(358,8)is part(1466,8)kingdom. He
promises fair(764,8)I hope among(1334,11)people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster,(790,11)him of our present arrangements,
and to request(752,9)will satisfy the various creditors of(873,12)
in and near Brighton(1131,20)speedy payment, for which(217,8)pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar(1253,12)to hi(191,12)in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list, according(1408,8)(2034,11)?(695,8)given in all his debts; I
hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and
all will be completed in a week. T(572,9)then join hi(807,11)
unless they are first invited to Longbourn(735,8)understand from Mrs.
(1698,9)that(1124,9) is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and her mother.--Yours, etc.

“E. GARDINER.”

(1842,10) and his daughters saw all the(1071,10)s of(1332,10)
(1433,15)e ----shire, as clearly as (1998,13)could do. But
Mrs(135,9)was not so well pleas(1871,8)it. Lydia’s being settled in
(1254,9), just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for(61,9)by no mean(732,8)up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia(1918,8)be taken from a(1533,9) where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.

“She is so fond of Mrs.(1367,9)” said she, “it(906,9)quite shocking
to send her away! And(1829,12)everal(1633,8)young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant(1825,17)
(1825,8).”

H(745,11)’s(1524,8), for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again,(989,11) set off for(1931,10),
r(1267,8)at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing,(102,9)sake(668,10)sister’s feelings and
consequence(367,10)(612,11)noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
(1213,8)husband at(1413,10), as soon as they were married,(1968,10)as

was surprised, however, that(1639,8)(1269,8)consent to such a scheme;
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.

CHAPTER LI.(101,16)]

T(978,14)wedding-day arrived; and(1077,19) felt for her
probably more than she(36,13)self. The c(1020,8)was (391,8)meet
them at----, and(925,11)to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival
was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--(218,9)more especially, who
gave Lydia the(1262,10)which (482,11)attended(230,8), had _she_
(510,9)culprit, and was wretched(956,8)thought of what he(1387,8)
must endure.

They came. The(1580,8)were assembl(85,10)breakfast-room(1316,11)
them. Smiles decked the face(1957,9)Bennet, (929,8)(1461,8)drove up(1098,8)door;(1391,13)looked impenetrably grave; her(1841,9)s, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

Lydia’s voice was hear(306,9)vestibule; (133,8) was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand w(953,25) to
Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy,(88,8)
alacrity which showed no doubt(1961,10)happiness.(1001,8)reception from(1525,11), to whom(1751,8)en turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
open(248,8)ips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.

(1190,10)was disgusted, and even(1033,12) was shocked. Lydia was
Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned
from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at
length they all sat down,(872,8)eagerly round(739,9), took notice of
some little alteration in (1178,8)observed(622,8) laugh, that(1990,8)a
great while since she had(1774,9)re.
(747,8)(578,9)at all more distressed than(1570,8); but his manners
were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his m(1639,8)been
exactly what they ought, his smiles(58,9)easy address, while he
claimed their relationship,(1551,12)delight(960,8)all.(1847,10)
had not before believed him quite equal to such(782,10); but she sat
down, resolving withi(326,9) to draw no limits in future to the
impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blush(824,8)Jane(18,8); but the
cheeks(939,8)two who caus(298,9)confusion suffered no variation of
colour.

There was no want of discourse. The bride and h(1474,10)could neither
of them talk fast enough; and (1411,13)happened to sit near(1089,10), began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good-humoured ease,(1470,9)e felt very unable to equal in her
replies. They seemed each (233,9)o have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing(1375,8)past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:
it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have(1204,8)ing(1618,9)(533,9)in the time. Good gracious! when(130,12), I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was.”

Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane(1807,8)tressed,(1176,10) looked
expressively at Lydia(1147,9), who never heard nor saw any(597,8)
(729,10)chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--

“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am(325,10)o-day? I was
afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,
so I was determined he should know(1843,9)so I let down the side glass
next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the
window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and
smiled like(428,9).”
(1257,10) could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out(1522,8)room;
and returne(758,9), till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour. She then join(1876,8)soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to(1586,11)’s right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister,--

“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a
(1031,8)woman.”

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from(1630,11)had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
spirits increased. She longed(371,8)Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all
their other(1818,10)s(778,8)(369,9)self called “Mrs.(1955,8)” by
(1769,12); an(1430,9)meantime she went after dinner to show her ring
and boast(1420,19)o Mrs. Hill(834,8) two housemaids.

“Well(1190,8)” said(1303,8)en they were all(783,10)to the
breakfast-room, “and what do you(1792,10)my husband? Is not he a
charming man?(1644,10) my(1908,9)must all envy me. I only hope they
may have half my good luck. They(68,10)go to Brighton. That is the
place to get(174,8)s. What a pity it is(1491,9)we did no(92,8)!”

“Very true; and if I had my will w(1395,8). But, my dear(1006,8)I don’t
at all li(909,8)going such a way off. Must it be so?”

“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I sh(99,9)it of all things.
You and papa, and(405,11), must come down and see us. We shall be at
Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I
will take car(425,9)good partners for them all.”

“I(1760,8)(230,8)beyond(2013,9)!” said(1349,11).

“A(1648,8)when you go away, you may leave one or two of(694,11)
behind you;(232,16)(376,8)(615,12)(185,10)before(1827,8)ter is over.”

“I thank you for my share(1723,8)favour(968,8)(1802,9); “but I do not

Their visitors were(1494,8)remain above ten days with them. Mr(1277,9)
had received his commission(251,8)he left London(1735,8) was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

No one but Mrs. Bennet regrett(1671,9)heir stay would be so short; and
she made the most(369,8)time by visiting about with her daugh(750,8)
having very frequent parties at home. These(23,9)were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think than(23,12) not.

Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what(614,10) had expected to
find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope(567,10)at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case,(881,8)not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.

(563,10)exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear(1069,8) on every
occasion; no on(1037,9)be put in competition with(89,9)did
everything best in the world(458,11)as sure (470,9)kill more birds
on the first of September than anybody else(100,8)country.

One morning, soon after their arrival, as(141,10)itting(1101,10)two
elder(1928,10)she said to(1519,10),--

“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?”

“No, really,” replie(1735,14)I (1208,8)ere cannot be too little
said on the subject.”

“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you(159,9)ent off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because(1781,8)’s lodgings were (960,8)parish. And(269,8)settl(1688,8)we should all be there by eleven
o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together;(438,15)
(36,8)meet us(1872,8)church.

“Well, Monday(707,8) came,(102,8)as i(1607,8) fuss! I was so afraid,
(305,10)that something(1346,9)ppen to put it off(609,9)n I should
have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all(1964,10)I was
dressing, preaching and talking away just as if(1056,9)reading a
sermon. However, I(1855,8) hear above one word in ten, for I was
thinking, you may suppose, of my(1291,13). I longed to know whether
(1668,9)be married in his blue coat(454,10)and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never
be over; for,(1845,8)bye, you are to understand that m(670,16)
were horrid unpleasant(426,19) with them. If you’ll(1189,8)
me(376,12)once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was
rather thin, but, h(538,8)the Little Theatre was open(409,16),(629,9)the carriage came to the door,(339,10)was
called away upon business to that(363,8)man Mr. Stone(816,9)n, you
know, when once they get(1082,9), there is no end of it. Well,(1010,9)
frightened(789,11)know what to do, for(198,13) to give me away;
and if we were beyond the hour we could not(765,12)all day. But,
luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ ti(1236,8)then we all set
out(1003,13)recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented
going, the(1908,8) nee(195,9)put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as
well.”

“(38,9)!” repeat(1842,12), in utter amazement.

“Oh, yes! h(380,9)com(1633,8)with(1725,8)(1770,10). But, gracious me!
I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will(1861,8) say? It(555,8)be(1648,8)secret!”

“If(1864,8)to be(29,9),” said Jane, “say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”

“Oh, certainly(111,8)(391,11)though burning with curiosity; “we will
ask you no questions.”

“Thank you(204,8)Lydia; “for if you did,(1834,9)(143,10) tell you
a(1539,8)then(346,9)(1599,9)so angry.”

On such encouragement to ask,(609,10) was forced(1980,12)ut of her
power, by runn(1884,8).

But to live in ignorance on(474,8)point was impossible; or at least it

sister’s(918,8).(618,8)exactly a scene, and(21,10)mong people,
where he had apparently leas(1270,9)and(17,8)emptation to go.
Conjectures as(1520,8)meaning of it, rapid and wild, hu(2035,8)to her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
(1442,12)ar such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which(561,9)
intended.

“(1059,8)readily comprehend,” she added, “what my(1010,10) must be to
know how a person unconnect(434,8)any of us, and, comparatively
speaking, a stranger to our family,(1044,8)have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly(699,8)t me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to rem(1913,8)(355,17)Lydia seems to
think necessary;(1944,10)I must endeavour(1551,8)(742,13)

“Not that I _shall_(1428,8)(427,12) to herself, and she finished the
letter; “and, my dea(646,8)(1414,8)o not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall(1448,11)be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out.”

satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.

(275,11)had th(605,8)ac(1109,8)receiving an answ(1171,10)letter as
soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession(1519,8)than
hurrying into the little copse, where(1518,9)least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length(57,8)letter convinced her that it(388,8)
contain a denial.

     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */

“My dear Niece,

     “I have just(601,8)d you(399,8)(975,8)all devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what I have to tell you.(1221,8)confess myself
     surprised by your application; I(725,9)expect it from _you_.
     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,
    (1329,8)had not imagined such(975,11)to be(1450,10) on _your_
     side. I(1309,13)choose to(1611,12)me, forgive my
     impertinence. Your uncle is as much(304,11)as I am; and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned w(1838,10)allowed
     him to act as he has done. But(1538,8)are really innocent and
     ignorant,(1736,8)be more explicit. On the very day of my com(207,9)home from Longbourn, y(286,10)had a most unexpected visitor. Mr(551,8)arcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was a(754,8)over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully rack(351,8)as _yours_ seems to have been. He cam(841,10)Mr. Gardin(1134,8)he
     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and(71,18)seen and talked with them both--(67,8)repeatedly, Lydia once.
     From(1036,8)can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after
     ourselv(1439,8)(266,9)own(149,9) resolu(1702,8)hunting for(978,8)em. The motive professed was his convi(1768,9)its being owing to(777,9)self that(326,8)’s worthlessness(1081,9)been so well known as
     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love (216,8)confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken
     pride, and(1431,8)e(528,9) had(739,8)thought it beneath him(283,9)lay his private actions open to the world. His(213,11)was(352,9)speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on
     by(492,8). If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would nev(700,8)disgrace(414,9)(112,9)some days in town(1097,8)he was able(630,9)discover them; bu(411,9)something to direct his search, which w(631,8)more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was(245,8)
     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a
     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy(1458,9)(357,9)missed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.
     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquaint(1433,8)Wickham; and(1550,9)went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got(1373,8). But
     it was two or three days(692,11)could get(389,10)w(1690,12)wanted. She(807,8)ot betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery(350,10)corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be(1064,8)und(1801,9), indeed, had gone(312,8)on their first arrival in
     London; and had she been(960,8) receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our
     kind(241,8)procur(1535,8)ished-for direction. They were in ----
     Street. He saw(292,10)and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.
     His first object(196,9), he acknowledg(374,8)been to persuade(918,8)r to quit her present(1370,9)ful situation, and return to (1205,9)friends(749,12)they could be prevailed on(439,12)her,
     offering his assistance as far as(1537,10)go. But he found Lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none(143,8)(733,11)s; she wanted no help of hi(27,8)(883,9)hear of
     leaving(1087,8). She was sure they sh(292,8)married(1444,11)or
     other, and it(1350,9)much signify when. Since such were(417,11)eelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite(1619,8)marriage, which, in his very first conversation(1339,13),(1335,9)easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of hon(976,9)whi(299,8)very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill
     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to(2040,8)sign his commission immediately; and as to his future(925,11)(1895,9)could conjectu(220,8)little about it. He must go somewhere, b(1685,8)(1968,11)(1522,10), and(1842,8) he(703,8)have nothing to liv(841,8)n. Mr. Darcy asked why(95,12)marry your sister at once.
     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, (1799,9)ha(138,8)(1592,13)do something for him, and his(1266,10) must have been(73,8)nefited by(788,9)(1171,14), in reply to this ques(424,11)that(1823,8) still cherished the hope of more effectually making
     his fortune(141,12), in some other country. Under such
     circumstances(1778,11)he(356,9)likely to be proof against t(979,8)temptation of(693,10) relief. They met several times, for there
     was much to be discussed.(1828,10)of course,(1423,8)more than(1121,9)could get; but a(2002,8) was reduc(562,9)reasonable. Everyth(348,9)being settled between _them_,(724,10)’s next step was to make
     your uncle acquainted with it(846,9)first called in Gracechur(424,8)Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner c(1688,8)(771,8) seen; and(918,11)found, on further inquiry, that your fat(2032,9)was still with him, bu(1952,8)quit town the next morning. He did
     not judge(97,12) to be a person whom(1237,10)so properly(1407,10)ult as(363,11), and therefore readily postponed seeing him
     till after the departure of the former(191,8) not leave his name,
     and till(250,10)day it was only known that a gentleman had called(1335,8) business. On Saturday he came again. Y(314,11)was gone, y(1762,9)uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk
     together(973,11)again on Sunday(374,9)n _I_ saw him too. It(994,10)not all(858,11)fore Monday: as soon as it was, the express(640,11)ent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I
     fancy, Lizz(746,8)obstinacy is the real defect of his character(500,8)fter all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;
     but _this_(124,8)true one. Nothing(1119,8)be done that(1960,11)
     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked(1697,9)(831,8)say(2012,9)about it)(1242,12)would most(875,9)(1911,10)(1345,8)the whole. They battled it(604,9) for a long time, whi(1707,8)was(1516,11)either the(837,11)or lady concerned in i(280,8)eserved. But at last(198,13)as forced to yield, and instea(921,8)f being allow(1609,9)of use to his niece,(82,15)put up
     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sore(1274,8)(1925,11) grain; and I really believe your letter this(1420,8)
     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation tha(983,8)ould rob him(808,8)borrowed feathers, and give the praise w(2048,10)it was due. But(923,11)is must go no(1702,9)than yourself, or
     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what(951,10)done
     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting,(1121,8)believe, to considerably(712,11)a thousand pounds, ano(1898,10)(30,9)in addition to her own(1349,9)upon _her_, and his(1825,8)mmission purchased. The reason why all this(1121,16)by(1827,10)alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to(145,10)reserve and want of proper(292,10)tion, that Wickham’(1400,11)
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently(1321,9)(52,8)(138,8)ceived and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_(1387,11)doubt whether _his_(244,8), or _anybody’s_(273,14)can be answerable(642,9)event. But in spite of(438,9)
     fine talking, my dear(1757,8)you may rest perfectly assured(970,11)(1494,17)never have yielded, if we had not given him cred(1391,8)for _another interest_ in the affair. When(638,14)resolve(1390,8)n, he returned again(1382,8)friends, who were still staying (1182,8)Pemberley; but(1126,8)agreed(1860,9)should be in London once mo(1183,8)when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to(629,13) the last finish. I(1458,9)I have now told you everything.
     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise;(1189,8)hope at least it will not afford you any dis(1567,8). Lydia came(218,9)us, and(946,8) had constant ad(1158,8)to the house. _He_ was
     exactly w(944,15) when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but(1399,8)would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour(496,8)ile she stay(43,8)us, if I(768,9)perceived, by Jane’s let(1194,9)last Wednesday,(1166,8)r conduct on coming home was(266,9)of a
     piece with it, and therefore what I now(244,10)can(509,10)no
     fresh pain. I talked(1616,8)repeatedly(935,8)most serious manner,(1478,8)present(1511,8)er the wickedness of what she had don(808,10)(1758,8)e unhappiness(43,9)brought on her family. If she heard me, (1133,8)was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.(520,8)ometimes
     quite provoked; but then I recollected(1374,9)Elizabeth and Jane,
     and(1470,8)ir sakes had patien(456,8)her. Mr. Darcy was punctual
     in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended(1185,12). He
     din(704,10) the next day, and(2040,8)leave town again on
    (702,10) or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me(1670,9)
    (1675,8)if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
     enough to say before) how much I like him? His(981,10) to us has,(350,9)every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.
     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a(1186,8)more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ev(1199,8)mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.

The contents of thi(1676,8) threw(1203,11)into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced,(1623,9)(1336,10)might(616,11)doing to forward her
sister’s match--which(1692,9)feared to encourage, as an exertion of

and, before (1037,10)strike into another path,(570,9)overtaken by(1528,9)

“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,
as he joined her.

“You certainly do,” she repli(430,8)a smile; “but it does not follow
that the(156,10)ion(1164,8) unwelcome.”

“I(1469,8)be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,
and now we ar(773,8).”

“True. Are the others coming out?”

“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so(374,16), I find, from ou(703,8)and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley.”

S(399,11)in the affirmative.

“I almost envy you th(896,12)and yet I(1673,8) it w(389,8)too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds(762,10)always very fond of
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”

“Yes,(44,8).”

“And what(1581,9)say?”

“That you were gone into the army, and(165,10)fraid had--not turned
out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.”

“C(920,8),” (916,10), biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped(1722,8)
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--

“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”

“Perhaps preparing for his m(888,8)with Miss de Bourgh,” said
(258,9). “It(1147,9)something particular to take him there at this
time of year.”

“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while(575,10)at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners t(643,8)had(702,8); he introduced us to his sis(1256,8)And do you like her?”

“Very much.”

“I have heard(1385,10)that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her(1727,10)not very promising. I am very glad
(174,8)d her. I hope she will turn (848,9)”

“I dare say(38,9); she has got over the most trying age.”

“(434,8)go by the village of Kympton(1553,14)recollect that w(1093,10)I(1139,9)it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most
delightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! I(1448,8)have suited me in
every respect.”

“How(1884,8)(1624,9)liked making sermons?”

“Exceedingly well. (1945,9)have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,
to be sure,(1693,10)(70,10)such a th(1048,8)me! The quiet, the
retirement of(1417,8)life,(324,12)answered all my ideas of
happiness! But it(724,9)to be(1023,10)ever hear Darcy(1674,9)the
circumstance when(1630,10)in Kent?”

“I _have_ heard from authority,(581,9)(1092,8)_as good_, tha(156,8)
left you conditionally only, and at t(859,8)of the present patron.”

“You have! Yes, there was(1341,11)in _that_; I told you so(1233,9)
first, you may remember.”

“I _did_ hear, too, that(106,11)a time when sermon-making(1112,9)so
palatabl(2028,8) as it seems to be at(225,8);(1369,10)actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and(170,9) business
had been compromised accordingly(341,9)did! and(588,12)wholly without foundation. Y(316,15)
what(368,12)on that point, when first we talked of it.”

They were now almost(529,8)door(529,8)house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--

“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us
quarrel about the past. In future,(1676,8)we shall be always of one
mind.”

She held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look(634,8)ey entered(427,10).

CHAPTER LIII.(60,16)]

(348,11) was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or(529,8)d his dea(565,8) Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to fi(942,8)she
had said enough to keep him quiet.

The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
(484,8)into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”

“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”

“Write to me very often(147,9).”

“As often as I can. But(985,9) married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may w(131,8)_me_. They will have nothing else to
do.”(801,13)’s adieus were much more(1004,14)than his wife’s. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr(654,8), as soon as t(1533,9)out of
(1514,11)“as ever I saw. He simp(1777,9)smirks, and makes love to us
all. I am prodigiously prou(1569,8). I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”

The loss of her daughter made(913,13)very dull for several days.

“I often think(321,8)she, “(2021,8)re is(518,9)so bad as parting with
one’s friends. One seems so forlorn(2016,9)them.”

“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a(236,9),” said
(1321,9). “It must make you better(1459,11)that your other four are
single.”

“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is(908,8);
but only(33,9)(1259,11)’s regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”

But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news(128,9)en began to be in circulation. T(2016,8)keeper
at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoo(776,8)(834,11)
weeks.(1788,16) quite in the fidgets. She(1253,8)at Jane, and(1281,9)and shook her head, by turns.

“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley i(199,13), sister,” (for Mrs.
Philips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better(1745,8)at
I care about it, though. H(1064,13)to us,(1699,9), and I am sure I
never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to
(531,11), if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that
(188,16). Y(188,9)sister, we agreed long ago never to mention
a word(288,9). And so, it i(544,8)certain he(444,10)?”

“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “(475,8) Nichols was in
Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was(218,8)ly true. He
comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
going(1133,8)butcher’s,(140,12),(193,11) to order in some meat on
(92,9)(890,8)e has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”

Miss(1898,8)had not been able to hear of h(932,10)(1800,8)changing
colour. It was many months since she had(612,8)ed his name to(1792,10); but now, as soon as they were alone togeth(1607,8)said,--

“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine(581,8)from
any silly cause. I was only confused(1509,9)moment,(1933,9)I fel(1202,9)_should_ b(1415,11). I do assure you that(1295,9)(2026,10)affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone;(169,9)we shall see the less of him(1398,10) I am afraid of
_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”
(547,10) did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of(1883,8)there with no
other view than what was acknowledg(540,8)she still thought him partial
to(1865,10) she wavered as(1060,8)greater probability(908,14)
there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough(1667,8)
(975,8)it.

“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes(201,8), “that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired,(1101,9)raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”

In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation(1283,8)arrival, (658,10)could easily
perceive(821,8)r spirits were affected by it. T(1244,9)more disturbed,
more unequal, than(1350,9)often seen them.

The subject(365,8)ad been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

“A(1454,10)ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you
will wait on him, of course.”

“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s erran(300,8)”

His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.

“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise(439,8)he. “If he wants our society, let
him seek it. He knows where we live.(307,12)spend _my_ hours in
running after my(215,10)s every time they go away and come back
(366,9)“Well, all(1996,8)is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my ask(655,8)to dine here, I
am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
make thirteen with ourselves, so(1718,9)ll be just room at table for
him.”

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know(1322,9)
(486,11)might all see(1103,12), in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. As the da(1844,9)arrival drew near,--

“I begin to be sorry(1471,8) comes at all(1212,8)Jane to(1635,11). “It(915,10)nothing; I could(1134,8) with perfect indifference; but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
says. Happy shall I be when his stay at (1105,11) is over!”

“I wish(269,10)ay anything to comfort you,” replied(1888,10); “but it
is wholly out of my power. You must feel it;(834,9)usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.”

(1779,12)arrived.(1766,14)through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings(757,8)that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted(826,8)s
that must intervene before their invitation c(1684,8)sent--hopeless of
see(1953,8)before. But on the third mor(1527,11)(945,12)in
Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the
paddock, and ride towards the house.

Her(2043,10) were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane(1337,8)ely
kept her place at the table; but(739,10), to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked--(262,8)Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by(1204,12)

“There is a gentleman(67,11)mamma(2043,8)Kitty; “who can it be?”

“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.”

“La!(1028,10)Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
(615,12)Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”

“Good gracious!(345,10)!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of(1037,12)’s will always be welcome here,(1653,8)ure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him.”

Jan(533,8) a(601,11) with surprise and concern. She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire,(1365,8)refore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend(1835,11), in (1038,11)almos(71,10)first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sis(944,10)uncomfortable
enough. Each(180,14)other, and of course(209,8)mselves(1609,9)ir
mother(1912,9)n(1022,8)dislike of(905,10), and her(1042,8)ion to be
civil to him only as (562,14)friend, without being heard by either
of them. B(1101,12) had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.
Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment(1416,8)
him. To Jane, he(1618,10)only a man whose proposals(164,9)refused,
and whose merit(34,10)undervalued; but to(151,9)more extensive
information, he was(1898,8)son(288,9)the whole family were indebted
(726,14)of benefits, and(355,10)regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what Jan(947,11)Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was(1011,8)equal to what(618,9)known on first witness(1024,8)altered
behaviour(1186,14).

The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
minute(388,8) additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she though(1331,8)at space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken; but she w(982,9)be secure.

“Let m(1367,8)see how he behaves(2013,8)she; “it will then be early
enough for expectation.”

She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and(1238,9)daring to
lift up (307,10)till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister as the servant was approaching the door. (1849,13)(1798,8)paler than usual, but more sedate than(1394,15)expected. On the
gentlemen’s appearing, her(672,8)increased; yet she receiv(225,8)with
tolerable ease(322,10) a propriety of (787,10)equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.

(1626,10)said as little to either as civility would al(811,9)sat down
again(1396,8)work,(868,9)eager(1700,11)it did not often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. H(475,9)serious as usual; and,
(917,11), more as he(1075,10)used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
(1830,8)seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps(1750,11)not in her
mother’s presence be what(1659,8)before her uncle and aunt. It was a
painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.

Bingley(2017,9)likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was(741,10)by Mrs.
Bennet(726,8)degree of(596,11)hich made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her courtesy and address of his friend(793,13)particularly, who knew that her mother owed(1206,8)latter the
preservation of her favourite(233,9) from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful(348,8)by a distinction so ill
applied.

Darcy, after inquiring(158,8)how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question
which s(757,13)answer(1543,9)confusion--said scarcely anything. He
was not seated by her:(855,8) that was the reason(432,8)silence; but
it ha(1832,8)en so in Derbyshire. There(1030,8)talked(1204,8)friends
when(968,14)to herself. But now several minutes elapsed,(1792,8)
bring(1680,8)sound(611,8)voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of(1839,10), she raised(1884,9) to his face, she as often
found(976,13)at Jane as at(227,8), and frequently on no object but
the ground. Mor(1382,9)fulness and less anxiety to pleas(1365,8)when
they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
with(414,8) for being so.

“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”

(131,8)in no humour for conversation(1773,8)yone but himself; and to
him(1424,9)hardly courage to speak.

She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.

“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.

He readily agreed to it.

“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
(285,19). Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my
own(1719,10). I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it(168,8)papers. It(641,8)the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;
though it (1370,8)put in as it ought to be(93,9)only said, ‘Lately,
George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’(1522,9)there being a
syllable said(1792,10)ther, or(508,11)where she lived, or(1573,10)
It was my brother(1686,9)’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came
to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”

Bingley replied(2047,8) did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up(1465,9). How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore,(1896,10)
not tell(1019,12)delightful thing, to be sure, to have a(676,9) well(729,8),”
continued her mother; “but at the same(1117,20)it is very
hard(108,9)her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a
place quite northward it seems,(763,8)re t(77,8)to stay, I do not
know how long. His regiment is there; for(941,28)
his leav(1995,8)----shire, a(2004,10)being gone into the Regulars.
Thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he
deserves.”

(597,9), who knew this to be levelled at(598,10),(1736,8)such misery
of shame that(613,10)(1701,8)keep her seat. It drew from her(1431,10)
the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done
before; and she asked(1737,8) whether he(1603,10)make any stay in the
country at present. A few weeks, he believed.

“When(1450,10)killed all your own birds(1879,14)” sai(816,12),
“I beg you will come here and shoot as(468,9)you please on Mr.
Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the coveys for you(588,13)’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were(1071,10)fair prospect to arise(407,11), as had
flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to(1202,10)vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.

“The first wish of my heart(600,8)she to(97,8), “is never more to be
in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one(2003,8)other again!”

Yet the misery, for which(361,20)were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admira(1230,8)her former
lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every
five minutes seemed to be giving h(493,8)of his (872,9). He found her
as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as
unaffected(1671,8) not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really(971,10)
(1666,9)talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,(69,10)did not always know when(1092,9)silent.

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and(172,8) to dine at
Longbourn in a few days’ time.

“You are quite a visit in my debt(1691,17)he added; “for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us as soon(1734,8)returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you
I was very much disappointed that you(458,9)come back and keep your
engagement.”

Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.

CHAPTER LIV.(72,16)]

A(709,10)(938,10)gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects
which must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed
her.

“Why, if(1691,9)only to be silent, grave, and in(1475,8)t,” said she,
“did he come at all?”

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

“H(55,8)be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he
was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he
no longer cares for(47,9)silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think
no more about him.”

Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept b(812,9)roach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her
bette(908,8)ied with their visitors than(757,10).

“Now(524,12) “th(1341,8)first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It(416,8)en be publicly
seen, that on both sides we meet only as common(796,16)
acquaintance.”

“Yes, very(835,13) indeed(843,8)(1100,9), laughingly. “Oh, Jane!
take care.”

“My dear Lizzy, you can(1469,10)me so weak as to be in danger now.”

“I think you are in very great(45,8)of making him as much in love with
you as ever.”

They(1938,9)see the gentlemen again till(399,8); and (1798,11), in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the
good-humour and(434,8)politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,
had revived.

O(581,9) there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
who were most(1817,8)ly expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, we(451,12)ood time. When they repaired to the
dining-room(1743,12)eagerly watched to see whether(306,8) would take
the place which, in(414,8)ir former parties, had belonged to him, by
(1223,10). Her prudent mother, occupied(1283,8)same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and(28,13)smile: it was
decided. He placed himself by her.

(1018,11)with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He
bore it with noble(1969,11)ce; and she would have imagined that
(470,8)had received his sanction to be happy, had she(995,8)n his eyes
likewise turn(178,11)Mr. Darcy(233,8)n expression of half-(1278,8)
alarm.

His behaviour to(1773,11) was such during dinnertime as(1760,8)an
admirat(104,8)er,(680,8)though more guarded than formerly, persuaded(427,12)that, if left wholly to(479,8), Jane’s happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet(439,10)pleasure from observing h(332,12). It
gave her(1356,9)animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour.(497,10) was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give(285,10)to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any(1446,10)discourse; but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. H(287,9)’s ungraciousness
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to(1564,10)’s mind;
(1104,13), at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt(1535,8)whole of
the family.

(423,8)in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together;(74,10)(122,8) the visit would not pass away
without enabl(80,11) enter into something more of conversation,
than the mere ceremonious salutation attend(994,8)entrance. Anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen
came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that(1015,8)made her uncivil.
She(1748,8)forward to their(194,9)(1054,8)point on which all her
chance of(1265,11)or(492,13)mus(1341,8).

“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for
ever.”

T(281,12) cam(1897,11)thought (231,10)as if (1924,13)
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round(1336,10),
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and(966,10) pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy,(839,9)r(1286,10)a single vacancy near her
which(873,8)dmit of a chair. And on(599,14)’s approaching, on(987,9)girls moved closer to her than ev(1327,8)said, in a whisper,--

“The men shan’t c(690,8)part us, I am determined. We want non(1000,8)m;
do we?”

Darcy had walked away to another part(1056,8)room. She foll(1379,9)with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to(468,8) and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!

“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish(1823,10)
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who(1369,10)
protest(188,9)such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent(1162,10)feelings.”(1626,10)a little revived, however, by his (1601,9)back his coffee-cup
himself(1066,10)seized th(1673,16) saying,--

“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”

“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”

“And quite alone? Have(1375,8) friends left her?”

“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough

some minutes, in silence; and, at last,(1223,8)young lady’s(1148,8)ing

When the tea things were removed(963,9) card tables placed,(1571,11)
all rose;(1518,15)was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
(512,8)views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the res(1359,9)party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables(1995,10)had
(649,8)to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
(1558,11), as to make him play as unsuccessfully as(1448,8).

Mrs.(2021,8)had designed to keep the two Netherfield(1895,10) to
supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the
oth(454,9)she had no(1217,16)detaining them.

“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as t(431,9)lef(1420,8)mselves, “what
say you(1503,8)day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I
assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any(1770,8)saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they n(71,8) so fat
a haunch. The soup was fifty times(1221,8)than what we had at the
Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that(857,9)ridges
(1150,8)arkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I(260,11)you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! (860,11), we shall have her
at(853,13)at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think(189,11)is as
good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved
girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”

](1145,13), in short, was in very great spirits:(1048,9)seen enough of
Bingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinc(670,8)she would get him at
last;(169,9)(1532,11)s of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour,(1469,9)far beyond reason,(132,11)as quite disappointed at
not(1813,12)there again the next day,(1518,11)s proposals.

“It has been a very agreeable day(1325,8)Miss(1535,8)to(2021,10). “The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one (1890,9)other. I hope we
may often meet again.”

(113,9) smiled.

“Lizzy, you must not do so. Y(20,12)suspect me. It mortifies me.(1419,13) that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
(306,10)and sensible young man without having a wish(496,8)it. I am
perfectly satisfied, from w(2033,8)manners now are, that he never had
any design of engaging my affection. It is only(66,9)is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man.”

“You(1129,10)cruel(1947,8)her sister, “you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment.”

“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in
others! But why should you wish to persuade me(590,8)feel more than I

“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante.”


(1523,24)Lizzy(1941,9), I want to speak to you.”

CHAPTER LV.(83,16)]

A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days’ time. He sat(1263,9)m above an hour, and(1737,8)remarkably
good(1742,8). (1792,11) invited him to di(1356,11)m; but, with many
express(1692,8)concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

“Next time you cal(930,9)she, “(1464,9) shall be more lucky.”

He(805,8)be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.(645,9)she
would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on
them.

“Can you come to-morrow?”

Yes, he had no engagement at all for(50,10); and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.

He came, and in such very good tim(1486,8)the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran(542,13)to her daughters’ room, in her
dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--

“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--(898,12)is
come. He is, indeed. M(75,9)(87,12). Here, Sarah,(434,8) Miss
(241,8)his moment, and help her on(220,10)gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy’s hair.”

“We will be down as soon as we can(1693,8)Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half(1045,8) ago.”

“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick(10,10)!
where is your sash(1401,9)?”

But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of(1984,11)s.

The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr(1305,9)retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary(388,15)to her instrument. Two obstacles of the
five being thus removed,(1448,13)sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, (347,8)making any
im(1497,8) on them. (88,10)(433,10)observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do
you keep(231,11) me for? What am I to do?”

“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--

“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.
Jane instantly gave a look at(453,12)hich spoke her distress at such
premeditation(1278,8)r entreaty that _she_(962,11)give in to it. In a
few(329,8)(709,14)half opened the door and called(1561,10)Lizzy(1111,9)(279,18)with you.”
(767,11)was forced to go.

“We may as well leave(1063,19), you know(1428,8)(1215,11)as

quietly(149,12) till she and Kitty were(575,8)sight, then returned
into the draw(163,9)

(1160,11)’s schemes for this day were ineffectual(1955,10)was
everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her
daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable
addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged
officiousnes(1466,8)(398,9)and heard all her silly remarks with a
forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the(267,10)

He scarcely needed an invita(236,8)stay supp(1456,8)before he went away
an engagement(838,8)med, chiefly through his own and(1694,12)’s
means, for his coming next morning to shoot(718,10)husband.

Afte(591,10), Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning(662,8); bu(1308,13)ent to bed in the
happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
(857,8) within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded(136,10)this must have taken plac(702,9)at gentleman’s
concurrence.

(925,11) punctual to his appointment(791,9)and Mr(1480,9)spent the
(476,10)gether, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
(932,9) than(573,8)panion expected. There was(2012,8) of presumption
or folly in(1148,9)that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence(1043,9)was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him(1303,10)of course(1407,9) with him to dinner;
an(657,8)(1201,9)(1422,14)invention was again at work to get
everybody away from him(2017,9)(1374,10)(1867,9), who had a letter to
write, went (1580,9)breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for
as the others were all go(1063,8)it down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract(1973,11)(1705,10).

But on her retu(1167,9)(1772,16), when her(246,8)was finished,
she saw, to her infinite surprise, t(680,9)reason to fear that her
m(540,10)been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she
perceived her sister and(1906,9)stand(917,12) over the hearth, as
if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,
the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved(652,11)each
other, would have told it all. _Their_ situa(751,10)wkward enough; but
_hers_ she thought was still wors(1591,9)syllable was uttered by
eith(1839,8)(1571,11)as on the point of going away again, when(1374,8), who as well (756,12) had sat down, suddenly rose, and,
whispering a few words(633,8)sister, ran out of the room.

Jan(813,8)have no reserves from(1000,14)ere confidence would give
pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged,(1664,8)e liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature(1262,8)world.

“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far(30,9). I do not deserve it. Oh,
why is not (1295,11)s happy?”

(1275,9)’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But sh(439,8)not
allow herself to stay with(571,13)or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.

“I must go(529,11)to my mother,” she cried. “I(155,10) on any
account trifle(155,10)affectionate solicitude, or (214,9) to hear it
from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to
know that what I(1152,8) relate will give such (791,8) to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much(447,10)?”

She then hasten(1298,8)to(1733,11)(1927,10)purposely broken up the
card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.(745,11), who was left by(564,8), now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affai(1839,9)ally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.

“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious
circumspection!(44,12)sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the
(1196,8), wisest, and most reasonable end!”

In a few minutes(1270,9)joined by(1968,8), whose conferenc(786,10)
fa(1583,9)been short and to the(536,8).

“Where is you(1570,8)?” said he(1935,8), as he opened the door.

“With(967,10)(575,9). She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”

He then shut(94,9), and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and(1038,10) of a sister.(1938,11)honestly and hearti(1374,10)ed her(1426,8)(1622,8)prospec(1841,8)ir relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till(1939,11) came(2007,8)he had to listen
to all (24,10)say of his own(1504,10), and of Jane’s perfections;
and in spite(62,8)being a lover,(293,11)really believed(801,8)
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
bas(898,8)xcellent understanding and super-(34,10)disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feel(77,8)taste between her and
himself.

It was an evening of no common (531,8)to them all; the satisfa(628,8)
Miss Bennet’s mind ga(1541,8)a glow of sweet animation(1474,8)face, as
made her l(599,9)omer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was(843,8)soon. Mrs. Bennet c(1901,9)give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her(386,8)s,
though she talked to(1229,8) of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
Mr(183,9)joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how(742,8)happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,--

“Jane, I congratulate you. You(1407,9)a ver(233,8)woman.”

Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.

“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in
thinking y(183,11)so happily settled.(66,8)not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that(680,9)will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that(261,9)
always exceed your income.”

“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in _me_.”

“Exceed thei(120,8)! My dear (903,10),” cried his wife, “what are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more.” Then addressing her(797,9), “Oh, my dear, dear (803,8)am so
happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
(317,8). I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you(1392,10)
be so beautiful for(1291,8)! I remember,(1066,12)ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I(542,8) how likely it was
(641,9)should come(843,11)Oh, he is the(1688,9)st young man that
ever was seen!”

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary (204,8)ed(1547,9)use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged(1484,8)rd for a few balls there every winter.

Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily (1724,8)at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and(780,8)remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who(807,10) be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he(1298,8)
himself obliged to accept.

Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation(557,10)sister; for
while(2003,8)present Jane had no atten(171,8)bestow on anyone else: but
she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of
separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always
attached (327,8)to (310,10)(728,8)(2012,9)of (1535,10) her; and
when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.

“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I ha(674,8)lieved
it possibl(1958,8)suspected as much,” replied(315,10). “But how did he account for
it?”

“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me(814,8)I cannot wonder at, since (1266,9)have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy(177,10)(48,9)
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we
can never be what we once were to each other.”

“That(1808,8)most unforgiving speech(653,8)(1118,9), “that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss(864,8)’s pretended regard.”

“Would you(700,8) it, Lizzy, that when he went to(768,11)November he
really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_(853,9)different
would have prevented his coming down again?”

“He made a(1439,8)mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty.”

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the(1584,8)value he put(47,8)own good qualities(1654,13)was pleased to find(1186,8)(1130,11)trayed the interference
of his friend; for,(730,8)(1660,9)(679,9)generous and (690,9)
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.

“I am(1171,11)(817,9)fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
Jane. “Oh(683,9)why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all? If I could but(855,10)s happy! If there were but such
another man for you!”

“If you(1073,9)give me forty such men I never(121,8)(1724,10) as you.
Till I have your disposition, your goodness,(79,10)an(50,10)
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if(123,8)very
good luck, I may meet with (263,8)Mr. Collins in time.”

The situation of affairs(613,8)Longbourn family coul(1877,8) long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and
she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.

The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest(241,8)in the
world;(1676,8)only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally prov(134,9)marked out for misfortune.

equipage did not answer to that of any of their (686,10). The horses
were post; and neither the(229,9), nor the liver(84,8) servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As(1587,8)certain, however, that
somebody wa(2024,8),(556,8) instantly prevailed on Miss(1027,8)to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. They both set off(505,9) conjectur(658,10)remaining three

open,(772,8)i(539,9) entered(592,9)Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their
astonishment was beyo(142,9)expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty(271,9)she was perfectly unkno(905,9)m, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She(274,8) the room(1688,8) air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to(103,10)’s salutation than a slight inclin(1752,9)the
head, and sat down(1639,9)saying a word.(201,11)had mentioned her
name to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance(611,9)no request of
introduction(1552,10)made.

(1863,11), all amazement(689,9)flattered by having a gues(862,9)
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After(1469,8)
for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly,(418,13),--

“I hope you are well,(1067,12). That lady, I suppose, is your
mother?”

(610,10)replied very concisely that(705,8).

“And _that_(90,16)one of your sisters?”

“Yes, madam,” said (401,13)delighted to speak to a(1001,15).
“She is my youngest girl but one. M(26,11)of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,
who, I believe, will soon become a(1053,9)(1990,10).”

“You have a very small park here,” returned(1261,15), after a
short(569,8).

“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I
assure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”

“This must be a most inconvenient(764,8)-room for the evening in
summer: the windows are full west.”(968,13) assured her that they never sat there after dinner(1747,9)n
added,--

“May I take the liberty of asking you(1161,10) whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well(763,10)very well. I saw them the night before last.(914,13)now expected(904,11)ould produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive(62,9)calling. But no

decent-looking rooms, walked on.

“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
her face.

As soon as they entered(328,10),(1218,16)began in the following
manner:--

“You can be at no loss, (1166,14)o understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, y(16,8)conscience, must tell you why I
com(978,15)look(1017,8)unaffected astonishment.

“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.”(1450,15)” repl(1271,8)(1984,8), in an angry tone, “you ought to
know that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_--that Miss(1312,11)Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off for this place,(725,8)might make my sentiments known to
you.”

“If you believed it im(132,8)(790,9)ue,” sai(1699,11), colouring
with(1047,13) and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could you(986,10) propose by it?”

“At once to insist upon having such a(745,8)universally contradicted.”

“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family(274,17)
coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed,(168,14)
is in existence.”

“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it(1394,9)
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not (1316,10)such a
report is spread abroad?”

“I never heard that it was.”

“And can you likewise declar(691,8)there is no _foundation_ for(491,8)I do not(252,12)possess equal(1323,10) with(572,14). _You_
may ask questions which _I_(1471,11)(1499,10)answer.”

“This is(1584,11)borne.(1968,14)I(649,8)on being satisfied. Has
he, has(1158,10), made you an offer of marriage?(671,9)(776,9)has(321,8)d i(1726,8)(953,10).”

“It(1778,9) be so;(1220,12)so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in(1224,8)I have(1791,10)be the last person to confess it.”

“(443,13)do you know who I am? I have(845,9) accustomed to such
language(1924,8). I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know(268,9)dearest concerns.”

“But you are not(62,18)_mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this ever induce m(1533,8)explicit.”

“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never.(1943,10) is
engaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”

“Only this,--that if he is so, you can(492,8) reason(1962,12)he will
make(937,10)to me.”

Lady Catherine hesitated for(794,9), and then replied,--

“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the
union; and now, at the(1059,8)when the wishes of both sisters would be
accomplished, is their(1310,9) to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importanc(204,8) world, and wholly unallied to
the family(1834,9)pay no regard to(210,15)his friends--to his
tacit(493,12)with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? H(762,8)not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”

“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If(2016,12)
other objec(1033,8)my marrying your(1817,9)(1484,8)certainly not be
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
(373,14). You both did as much as you could in planning the
(1956,8). Its completion depended on others. If(1225,13) neither by
honour nor inclination confined to(397,11), why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”

“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss
(1876,8)(39,8); for do not expect to be noticed by(2032,11) or
friends, if you wilfully act against the(307,12)s of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.”

“These are heavy misfortunes,”(1574,8) Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole,(1846,9)cause
to repine.”

“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss (713,8)that I came
here with the determined resolution of c(1236,8)my purpose; nor will I
be dissuaded(1229,8). I(334,8)t been used to submit to any person’s
whims(54,18)in the habit of brooking disappointment.”

“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s(522,10) at present more pitiable;
but it will(527,9)effect on _me_.”

“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; an(53,10)father’s, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid(201,14)(1943,10)(235,10) by the voice of
every member of their(177,8)ive hous(1991,8)(1964,9)o divide
them?--the upstart pretens(1371,9) young woman without family,
connections, o(227,9)(979,10)to be endured? But it must not, shall
not be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”

“In m(950,8)your nephew, I sh(100,9)consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am(18,12)’s(738,9); so far we are
equal.”

“True. You _are_(64,23). But what was your mother? Who
are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant(583,9)
condition.”

“Whatever my(1842,8)ions may be,” sai(1720,11), “if(339,12) does
not object to them, they can be(1484,9)to _you_.”

“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”

Though(1861,10)(559,10), for the mere(1446,8) of obliging Lady
Catherin(1772,8)answered this question,(1828,10) not but say, after a
moment’s deliberation,--

“I am not.”

Lady (115,9) seemed pleased.

“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?(1417,11)make no(69,9)of the kind.”

“(1796,13)I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable(1086,12). But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
will ever recede. I shall not go away t(281,8)have given me the
assurance I require.”

“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. (420,8) to be intimidated into
anything so wholly un(254,10). Y(1881,12) wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your(1046,11)but would my giving you the wished-for(520,10)ake
_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him(1410,8) bestow it on
his cousin? Allow me to say, (752,14), that the arguments with
(1473,15)support(902,8)extraordinary application(1519,11)as
frivolous as the(42,13)was ill-judged. Y(1581,8)widely mistaken my
character, if you think I(1213,8)worked on by such persuasion(126,8)se.
How far(1310,13)might approv(1781,10)interference in _his_ affairs,
I cannot tell; but(1774,10)(733,10)no right to concern(888,12)
mine. I must beg, therefore,(762,8)mportuned no further on the
subject.”

“Not so hasty(295,9)please. I have by no means done. To all the
obj(1626,8)I have already urged(68,8)still another to add(944,9)
stranger to the particulars(347,9)youngest sister’s infamous
elopement. I know it all;(681,10)young man’s marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expens(484,10)father and uncle. And is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son
of his late father’s steward(482,8)his brother? Heaven and earth!--of
what(1909,9)thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”

“You can _now_ hav(2042,10)(605,8)to say,” she resentfully(1931,9).
“(942,9)insulted me, in every possible method(740,12) to return to
the house.”

And she rose as she spoke.(1208,15) rose also, and they turned
back. He(1534,13)s highly incensed.
(196,11)no regard, then, for the honour and credit of(521,10)!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”

“(1477,16)I(456,28). You know my sentiments.(526,8)are then resolved to have him?”

“(1018,8)aid no such thing. I am only(62,13)act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
re(1422,8)to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”

“It is well. You refuse(505,8)to oblige me(32,12) to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. (348,8)determined to ruin him in
the(257,8) of all his friends, (2028,13)the contempt of the world.”

“Neither duty, nor(150,9)nor(150,10),” replied Elizabeth, “has any
(951,9)claim on(982,8)the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation(274,13), if the former
_were_ excited by hi(1597,11)me, it would not give me one moment’s
concern--and(381,10) in general would have too much sense to join(500,8)scorn.”

“And this is your real(789,8)! T(27,12)final(933,8)! Very well. I
shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”

In this manner(1520,16)talked on till they were(2010,8)door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--

“I take no leave of you(303,13). I send no compliments to your
mother. You deserve(1327,9)attention. I am most seriously displeased.”

(923,9) made no answer; and(1297,8) attempting to persuade her
(1786,9)(1900,10)into (1902,9), walked quietly into it herself. She
heard (340,12) drive away(1953,8)proceeded upstairs. Her mother
impatiently met her(437,15) her dressing-room, to ask why Lady

“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “sh(92,8)go.”

“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on(992,8)suppose she had

CHAPTER LVII.(66,16)]

The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw(991,11)into c(1656,9)be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly.(1362,15), it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings
for the sole purpose of breaking off her(750,8)d engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of
their(99,12)could originate, (666,14)at a loss to(1830,8);
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her(48,12)sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had no(1518,9) forgotten to feel t(345,8)m(1530,8)of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at
Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for(1200,8)(995,9)mmunication with the
(1316,9),(513,11), she conclud(729,8)reached(770,16)) had
only set _that_ down as almost cert(1631,8)immediate which _she_ had
looked forward to as (1160,8) at some future time.

In revolving(925,15)’s expressions, however(221,8)(1793,8)help
feeling some uneasiness as to the(136,10)consequenc(462,8) persisting
in this interference. F(870,9)she had said(1974,8)resolution to
preven(567,14), it occurred to(893,11)t(86,8)must meditate an
appl(496,8)to her nephew; and how (1721,9)take a similar
represen(818,10)the evils attached to a connec(596,10)her she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence(1988,8)judgment, but it was natural(956,8)ose
that he(1975,9)much higher(457,8)Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was(721,8), that in enumerat(1232,8)miseries of a(1023,10)with _one_
whose(782,11)(330,10)s were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably(1208,15)arguments,(1941,8)(636,12)had (1790,8) weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do(158,8)had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as(357,8)
unblemished could make him. In that case(397,9) return no more. Lady
(1395,9) might see him in her way(1522,10)own; and his(1989,12)to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

“If(1634,13)an excuse for not keeping his promis(417,9)come to his
friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand
it. (35,8)then give over every (2033,11), every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when(1333,9)
have ob(737,8)y(1211,10)s and hand,(167,9)soon cease to regret him
at all.”

The surprise(1397,8)rest(1409,8)family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great: but they obligingly(245,11)it with the same
kind of supposition(871,11)appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and
(1704,10)was spared from much teasing on the subject.

The next morning, as she was going down stairs,(27,9)met by her
father, who came out(1636,8)library with a letter in his hand.

“Lizzy,” said he, “I(127,11)to look for you: come into my room.”

She followed him thither; and her(305,10) to know(1246,9)had to tell
her was heightened by the(414,13)of its being in some manner
connect(734,8)the(247,8)he held. It suddenly struck her that it might
be from Lady (1172,9), and she anticipa(106,9)dismay all the
consequent explanations.(300,16)er father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He
then said,--

“I have received(492,10)this(605,8) that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought(461,9)its
contents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters(793,8)brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest(1125,8)colour now rushed in(2010,12)’s cheeks in the instantaneous

himself at all, or offend(46,9)is(994,8)was not rather addressed to
herself(1509,9)(640,9)continued,--

“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the
name of your admirer. T(244,11)is from Mr. Collins.”

“F(21,15)! and what can _he_ have to say?”

“Something very much(927,8)purpose, of course. He begins with
(683,11)ion(733,9)approaching nuptials of my eldest(784,9), of
which, it seems, he has been told by som(1858,9)good-natured, gossiping
Lucases.(1954,9)not sport with your impatience by reading(1443,9)says
on that point. What relates to(1054,9) is as follows:--‘Having thus
offered you the sincer(991,13)ions of Mrs(458,9) and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint(1910,15) of another,
of which we have been advertis(1662,11)ame authority. Your(1215,9)(2046,10), it is presumed, will not long bear the (719,8)Bennet, after
her(523,8)sister has resigned it;(1555,8) chosen partner of(1610,8)e
may be reasonably looked up to as on(565,9)most illustrious personages
in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?
‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the
heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and
extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of(1990,8)se temptations(614,9)warn
my cousin(1615,10), and(1831,11)of what evils you may incur by a
precipitate closure with this(304,10)’s proposals, which(1152,11),
you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,
(459,11)(130,14) is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for
cautioning you(1037,17)We hav(670,8) to imagine(1732,10)aunt,
Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look(1373,8)match with a friendly
eye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now(712,9)(1698,10)_have_
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related? (242,9), who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably(64,11)ed at _you_ in
his life! It is admirable!”
(1303,10) tried to join in(1197,8)her’s pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.

“Are you not diverted?”

“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”

“‘After men(754,8)the likelihood of this marriag(111,8) Ladyship last
night, sh(940,11)l(1286,8)her usual condescension, expressed what she

hastily into a(470,10)which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.
Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that(365,10) Lydia’s sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concern(86,8)their
living together before the(694,12)ok place should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to for(752,8)m as
a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be(1199,8)ed(52,9)hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of
(129,9)(157,8)ness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear
Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,
Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy(356,9)are not going to be
_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For
what do we live,(1872,8)make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them
in our turn(1653,8)” cried (1862,9), “I am exceedingly(1706,9). But it is so
strange!”

“Yes, _t(473,8)what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_
pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I(1655,8)ot give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a(713,8)of his, I cannot help giving
him the pre(234,8)even over Wickham, m(194,9)value the impud(283,8)
hypocrisy(1303,8)on-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse (1947,11)?”

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it.(762,10) had never been more at a loss(881,9)her
feelings appear(2005,11)were not(1516,9)necessary to laugh when she
would rather have cried. Her f(23,8)d most cruelly mortified her by
what he said of Mr. Darcy’s(803,13); and she could do(861,8) but
wonder at such a want of penetr(1862,10)fear that, perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.

CHAPTER LVIII.(101,16)]

I(192,9) receiving any such(937,11)excuse from his friend, as
(584,12)lf expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to(2032,10) before many days had passed after(937,15)’s
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and,(92,8)Mrs. Bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen(397,9), of which her(986,10)sat in
momentary dread,(273,8), who wante(1806,9)lone with Jane, proposed
their all walking ou(872,10)agreed to.(203,13)(1030,8)in the
habit of(67,8), Mary coul(1020,8)spare tim(1897,8)he remaining five
set off togethe(481,11)and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them. They lagged behind, while(1950,12)Kitty, and(562,8)ere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was
too much afraid of(648,8)talk;(1320,11)was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and(1064,11)(1027,9)be doing the same.

They walked towards the Lucases’, because(182,8)ished to call upon
Maria(1591,9)(1500,10)saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on (945,9)alone. Now was the
moment for her(279,11) to be executed; and whil(1849,8)urage was
high, she immediately said,--

“(1518,9), I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving
relief to my own (1760,9)care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister. Ever since I have known it(16,8)been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family I should not have merely(305,8)gratitude to express.”

“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied(451,8)in a tone of surprise
and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so(1105,8)to be trusted.”

“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me (229,11)d been(922,8)ed in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all(537,10), for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications(105,8)e
(956,8)discovering them.”

“If you _will_ thank me,” he(619,8), “let it be(915,9)self alone.
That the wish(1062,10) happi(940,8)you might add force(830,8)other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I(614,8)
only of _you_.”

(1736,14)(1782,9)embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, “You are too(529,10)to trifle with me. If your
(1385,9)are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever(315,13),(1570,8) all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and(1785,12), though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with(1556,11)and pleasure his present assurances. The
(867,10)which this reply produced was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he(1684,8)ed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had (872,9)
been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but
though she c(1998,9)look(19,11)listen(312,9)told her of(756,8)s
which, in proving(1907,9)importance she was to him, made his (941,9)
every moment more valuable.

They walked on without knowing in what direction. Ther(116,8)(1631,8)o
be(1906,8), and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt t(1188,14)indebted(1700,8)ir(738,9)good(910,11)ing
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive(55,9)
substance of her conversation with(715,10); dwelling emphatically (460,9)(681,14)the latter, (564,10)her Ladyship’s apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverse(1359,10)(1082,8), in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
(233,8), its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposi(767,8)be certain, that
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly(1910,13) coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you kno(237,11)
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I c(235,9) no scruple in(67,13)to all
your(671,9)s.”

“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it(1479,9)abhorrence.”

“We will not quarrel(1357,8) greater share of blame annexed to that
evening(807,8)(1919,9). “The conduct of neither, if strictly
examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,
improved in civility.”

“(270,9)be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection(1887,9)I
then said, of my(216,8), my manners, m(1418,12)s during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, in(1490,8)bly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘H(1103,9)haved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. Y(994,8)not, you can
(1296,9)conceive, how they have tortured me;(833,8)it was some time, I
confess, before I was reasonable(1350,8)to allow their justice.”

“I was(1357,8)ly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
im(1871,8). I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a wa(648,11)(639,8)(1281,8)it. You tho(1654,9)hen devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn(1631,9)countenance(531,14)
forget, as you said(1263,8)could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce(1390,9)ccept me.”

“Oh, do not repeat what I (856,9). Thes(896,14)s(1181,10)do at
all. I as(252,9)that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”

Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it(2038,11)--“did it _soon_ make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?”

She explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all
her former prejudices(54,9) removed.

“I knew(234,11) “th(411,10)wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the(352,9)There was one part,
especially the opening of it, which I should dread your hav(1376,8)power
of(372,9)again. I can remember some(1443,13)which might justly

preserva(1631,8)my regard; but,(1306,8)(1765,12) reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not(1832,9) quit(1801,11)
changed as that implies.”

“When(520,9)that letter,” replied Darcy, “I(1235,8)d myself perfectly
calm and cool; but I am since convinced tha(599,8) written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit(414,15), perhaps, began in(55,11)(699,9)did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of(724,16) feelings
of the person who wrote and(25,16)received it are now so widely
different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance
attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my
philosophy. Think only(257,8)past as its remembrance gives you
pleasur(1945,8)canno(1104,11)credit for any (110,10)(355,8)kind. _Your_
retrosp(1565,8)must be so totally (1847,8)reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of(132,11), but, what is much better, of
ignorance. But with _me_, it(80,8)so. Painful(1754,19)
intrude(1252,8)canno(1266,9)ought no(432,8)repelled.(1776,8)been a
selfish being all my life, in practice(1115,9)not in principle. As a
child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not(39,8)to correct my
temper. I was given good(113,10)s, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years(28,9)_child_),
I was spoiled by my parents, who(1394,9)good themselves, (my father
particularly, all t(283,8)benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almos(313,9)me to be (450,8)and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle,(1569,11)eanly of all the rest(1206,8)world, to
_wish_ at least(65,20)their sense and worth compared with
my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might
still(728,11)but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not
owe you! You(362,11)a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a
doubt(2017,9)ception. You showed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”

“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”

“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? (2031,11)you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.”

“My manners must(1224,11)in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How y(1790,8)have hated me after _that_ evening!”

“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps,(597,16)y anger soon began to
take a proper direction.”

“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”

“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”

“Your(18,9) could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me(662,8)deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess(59,9)id not expect to receive _more_ than my due(654,8)object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility
in my power,(860,8)(1827,8)so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduce(1813,14)I can hardly tell, but(1040,10) in about half
an hour after I had seen you.”

He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that(59,13), she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister(416,10)formed
before he quitted the inn, and(123,10)gravity and(1041,8)fulness there
had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.

She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each to be dwelt on farther.

After walking several miles in a leisurel(1613,8), and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
(206,8)ime to be at home.

“What could(1741,8)come of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which(877,15) discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy wa(799,9)ed with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest informa(704,8)it.

“I must ask whether you were(1558,9)d?” said Elizabeth.

“Not at all. When I went away(1637,9)that it would soon happen.”

“That is to say, you(193,11)your permission. I guessed as much.” And
though he exclaimed at the term, she fou(849,8)it(1320,10)pretty much
the case.

“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a(1714,8)ion to him, which(1346,11)I ought to have made long ago. I told
him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His(2030,10)was great. He had never had
the slightest suspicion(172,8) him, moreov(1827,11)believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done,(1755,11)sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive(1468,10)attachment to her was
unabated(688,9)no doubt of their happiness together.”

(778,9) could not help smiling at his eas(1214,8) of directing his
friend.

“Did you speak from your own observati(621,10)she, “when you(382,9)
that my(1645,8)loved him, or merely from my(1038,13)last spring?”

“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits
(752,8)had lately made her here; and I was convince(2025,8) affection.”

“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.”

“It did(1459,10)is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one
thing(1117,8)for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.(817,9)not
allow myself to conceal(901,18)(1334,9)in town three months
last wint(1022,11)had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any(977,10)(1104,11)’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
now(1010,14)longed to(776,8) that Mr(597,10)(1631,9)a most(1986,8)ful
friend; so(1197,8)guided(1195,10)worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. She remember(71,9)e had yet to learn to be laughed at, and
it was rather too early to begin. In anticipat(1000,8)(1301,10)of
Bingley(1763,8)of course was to be inferior only to(811,8), he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.

CHAPTER LIX.(107,16)]

“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question
which (1638,10)received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table. She had(425,9)say in
reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured(189,8)spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by(91,9) extraordinary. The
ac(181,9)d lovers talked and(841,8); the un(46,13)were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which(852,12)verflows in mirth;
and(527,10), agitated and confused,(967,8)_knew_ that(401,9)happy
than _felt_ her(1522,8)be so; for, besides the(1869,11)embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She(1081,10)ed what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known:(604,9)aware that no one
liked him but Jane; and even fea(1305,9)with(780,12)it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune(364,8)sequence might do away.

At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though(701,11)was very far
from Miss Bennet’s general habits,(264,10)bsolutely incredulous here.

“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me: I know it(1508,8)mpossible.”

“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;
and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet(102,8), I
am in earnest. I speak nothing but(1088,11) He still loves me, and we
are engaged.”

Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it(373,10).(317,8)how much
you dislike him.”

“You know(166,9)of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these
a good memory is unpardonable. (495,8)the last time I shall ever
remember it myself.”

(747,11)(373,9)oked all amazement.(1804,11)again, and more
seriously, assured her of its(1555,9)“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must(606,9)you,” cried
Jane. (2018,8),(2024,13)I would, I do congratulate you; but are you
certain--forgive the(2046,9)--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?”

“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that(744,8)to be the happiest couple in the world. B(216,10) pleased, Jane?
Shall you like to have such a brother?”

“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we(1982,8)of it as(1202,12) And do you
really(810,10)quite well enough? (984,11)do anything(1919,8)than
marry without affection. A(476,13)su(1739,8)you feel w(487,8)ought
to do?”

“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I
tell you all.”

“What do you mean?”

“Why,(776,8)confess that I(1090,10)better(107,8)do(409,8). I am
afraid y(172,8)be angry.”

(833,8)est sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very(29,8)ly.
Let me know everything(171,8)am to know(393,9)delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved(857,9)It has been coming on so gradually,(289,8)hardly know when it began;
but I(1719,9)I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley.”

Another entreaty that she would be(338,8), however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. When convinced on that article, (1531,12)had(1934,8)
further to wish.

“Now I a(909,8)happy,” said she, “for(620,14)s happy as(1646,8) I
always had a value for him. Were it for(1907,9)but his love of you, I
mus(1874,9)have esteemed him; but now, as(1198,8)’s friend and your
husband, t(1461,12)only(1251,9)(44,8)(1254,9) dear to me. But,
Lizzy,(695,10)been very sl(1362,8)reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed (619,12) and Lambton! I owe all(1050,8)know
of it to another, not to you.”

(1992,10)told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to
mention(1551,8); and the un(1761,8)state(83,8)own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of hi(439,8):(469,8)(854,11)no longer
conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.

“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not(1273,8)here again with
our dea(1946,9)! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
(95,11)? I had no notion but (1232,9)go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do(35,8)m?(859,12)must walk out(35,9) again, that he may not be i(665,9)’s
way(763,14)could(1577,8)help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed(126,8)r mother sh(1524,8)always giving him such an
epithet.

As soon as they entered,(1156,9)looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt(857,8)good information;
and (1652,8)afterwards said aloud, “(739,13)have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”

“I advis(766,11), and Lizzy, and Kitt(1662,9)(883,13)“to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and(885,11)has
never seen the view.”

“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr.(1318,10)“but I am
sure it(1842,9)too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”

Kitty own(635,8)she had rather stay at home(1088,8)professed a great
curiosity to see(223,9) from the Mount, and (1589,10)silently
consented. As she went upstairs to get ready,(1305,12) followed her,
saying,--

“I am quite sorry,(502,8)that you(860,11)forced to have that
(1342,13)man all to(1987,9); but I hope you will not mind it. It is
all for Jane’s sake, you know(1770,9)re is no occasion for talking to
him except just now(1830,8)n; so do not put(164,9) to in(1152,9)ce.”

During their walk, it was resolv(1158,8)Mr(1663,8)’s consent(1168,10)
asked in the course of the evening:(491,11)reserved to herself the
applicat(241,8)(1275,10)’s. She could not determine how(1317,11)
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeu(70,8)be enough to overcome her abhorrenc(232,9)man; but(95,9)she
were violently set against the match, or(36,11)delighted with it, it
was certain(1559,11)anner (172,10)qually ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and s(341,11) more bear(500,10)Darcy(1657,8)hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehem(295,8)her
disapprobation.

In(551,12),(1572,11)(629,11) withdrew to the library, she saw
(1374,10)rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that i(823,11) through her means; that _she_,
his favourite child,(1193,11)distressing him by her choice(41,11)
fill(37,8)with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection,(572,9)sat in misery till(1768,11)appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where(87,9)sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go(1531,8) father; he
wants you(1287,8)library.” S(543,9)ne directly.

H(595,9) was walking about the room, (305,8)grave and anxious.
“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”

How earnestly did she then wish(1192,10)former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and prof(74,8)which(1756,8)exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary(760,10)assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to(1363,10).

“Or, in other words, you are(1759,10)d to have him. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?”

“Have you any other objection(641,8)(2019,9), “than your belief of my
indifference?”

“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of(1911,9)
this(1803,10)nothing if you really liked him.”

“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride(437,8)perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he(175,8)is; then pray do not pain me by speak(1457,8)im in
such terms.”
(1055,17)(1730,8), “I have given him my consent(614,8)the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I(1739,8)never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_,(440,8)are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your
dis(1982,10)Lizzy(32,9)that you c(585,9)either happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband(40,13)looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talent(728,8)place(1635,11)
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. Y(210,9)scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child,(353,8)not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not w(368,8)are
about.”

(1095,11)still more affected, was(1657,8) and solemn(930,8)reply;
and, at length, by repeated assurances that(1431,10) was(1069,8)the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change(756,9)r
estimation(933,8)had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the tes(1320,8)y
months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,
she did conquer(1112,11)’s incredulity, and reconcile(1489,8)the
match.

“Well, my dear(1193,10), when she ceased(1260,9)(1211,10)no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could(722,10)parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”

To complete the favourable impression, she then told him w(622,13)
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.

“This is an evening of wonders(1458,8)! And so, Darcy did everything;
made up the match, g(1005,8)money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry(271,11) their own
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of(388,8)ter.”

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading
Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure(1565,13)’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour’s quiet reflectio(1613,9)own room, she was (1766,8)join
the others with tolerable composure. E(604,10)was too recent for
gaiety,(679,8)(967,9)passed tranquilly away;(569,8)as no longer
anything material to be dreaded(626,9) comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she fo(575,10),
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could
comprehend w(26,8)heard, though not in general backward to credit what
was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

“Good gracious! Lor(37,8)me! only think! dear me!(1814,10)! Who would
have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you(1402,8)! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
(57,9)have! Jane’s is nothing to it--(15,8)at all. I am so
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my
dear(225,8)pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope(1722,9)overlook it. Dear, (104,10). A house in town!(1236,11)
that is(195,9)! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! what(1811,8)come of me?(1923,9)go distracted.”

This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and(1619,10), rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by(758,8),
soon went away. But(1935,8)she had been three(1104,8)(1640,17)
(1385,11)(1342,12).

“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of(660,9)else. Ten
(379,15), and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a
special licence--you must and shall be(500,8) by a (52,15).
But, m(207,10)love, tell me what dish(1045,10) is particularly fond
of, that I may have it to-morrow(548,13)a sad omen of w(546,8)mother’s behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and (567,9) found that(1526,9)in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secur(1528,9)relations’
consent, there was still some(1150,9)be wished for. But the morrow
passed off(1037,8)tter than she expected; for(1868,13)luckily stood
in such aw(1698,9)intended son-in-law(1836,11)ventured not to speak
to him, unless it wa(786,9)power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.
(991,10) had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr(296,9)soon assured her(1162,8) was rising
every hour in his esteem.

“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think(1359,9)like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane’s.”

“The obsequious civility.”

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]




CHAPTER LX.(99,16)](445,11)’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account(549,9)having ever fallen in love with her. “How could
you begin?” said she.(1402,8)comprehend your going on(2013,9)ly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off(1111,8)first
place?”

“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot(13,9)look(26,9)words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I(939,8)the middle(1773,8)I
knew(1432,8)_had_ begun.”

“My beauty (261,8)early withstood, and as for my manners--my(1443,10)
to _you_ was at least always bordering(267,8)uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wis(1362,8)give you pain than not. Now, be
sincere; did you(961,8)me(194,8)impertinence?”

“F(392,8)iveliness of your mind I did.”

“You may(913,8) call it(83,13) at once. It was(2002,8)ttle less.
The fact is, that you were sick of(955,9), of(1358,10), of officious
(1405,9). Y(65,8)disgus(1301,9)the women who were(406,8)speaking,
and looking, and thinking for(1170,8)approbation alone. I roused and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
amiable you would have hated(453,8)it: but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings(274,13)noble and just; and
in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of(1307,8)(390,8)it;
and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall(1453,8).”

“Was there no good (332,8)affectionate(1092,10) to Jane, while she was
ill at Netherfield?”

“Dearest Jane! who c(558,10)done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last? W(57,16)shy of me, when you
first calle(1615,8)fterwards dined here? Why, especial(1950,8) you
(61,8)(1493,8)look as if you did not care about me?”

“Because(1377,10)grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”

“But I was embarrassed.”

“And so was I(1569,10)ight have talked to me more(277,9) came to dinner.”

“A man who had felt less might.”

“How unlucky(1592,10)sh(1319,10)a (996,10) answer(1845,8)(1499,8)at
I(52,8)be so(51,13)s to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on,(400,8)had been left to(1407,9).(78,10)when
you (74,13)spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of
than(711,9)for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too
much_, I am afraid; for what becomes(1640,8)moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject? This will never do(612,9)need not distress(354,11)T(162,8) will be(1538,10) fair. Lady
Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to
wait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,
and I was determined at once to know everything.”

“Lady (342,9) has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what(1298,9)come down to
(1837,11) for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be(1251,12)?
or had you intended any more serious consequences?”

“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope(298,9)you love me. My avowed one, (944,8)I(22,8)to
myself,(134,12)(101,8)your sister was still partial to Bingley, and
if she were,(440,9)the confession to him which I have since made.”

“Shall you ever have courage to announce to (594,15)what is to
befall her?”

“I am more likely to want time than(99,8), Elizabeth. But it(650,9)
be done; and(1883,8)will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done
directly(1823,9)(1482,14) letter to write (414,8)I might sit by you, and
admire the evenness(977,8) writing, as ano(467,8)ng lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”

From an unwilling(1625,8)confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
(1810,9)overrated(394,11) had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s
long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of(1507,10), and immediately wrote as
follows:--

“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as(1870,9)(1866,8)done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the
truth, I was too cross(702,9). You supposed more than really existed.
But _now_(45,8) as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,
indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly
err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more
than you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to
the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the
ponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the
happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
(749,8)but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
only smiles, I laugh.(1170,10) sends you all the lov(174,14) that
can be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours,” etc.

(1305,9)’s(1555,11)(1776,16)as in a different style, and still
(27,10)from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return
for his last.

     /* “Dear Sir, */

     “I must trouble you once more for congratulations.(1515,11)will
     soon be the wife of(1585,10). Console(277,16)as well as
    (921,8). But, if I were you, (1361,8)stand by the nephew. He h(70,8)more to give.

“Yours sincerely(440,10)iss Bingley’s(232,16) to her brother on his approaching
marriage we(572,8)hat was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to
Jane on the occasion, to express her(967,8), and repeat all her former
professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but(1837,10)ffected; and
though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much
kinder answer than(1979,11)as deserved.

The joy which Miss Darcy(256,8)ed on receiving similar information was
a(487,9) as(446,12)’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain(363,9)(391,13)(384,8)earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.

Before any(286,8)could arrive from(986,14)or any(906,16)
to(908,11)from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident.(1286,16)had been rendered so
exceedingly angry(989,8)contents of her nephew(1382,9), that
Charlotte, really rejoicing(1711,8)match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival(156,8)friend
was a(645,9)pleasure (426,12), though(1868,8)course of their
meetings she must sometimes think th(91,11)dearly bought, when she
saw(1825,11)exposed to(1826,9)parading and obsequious civility of her
husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of(327,8)ntry, and(1080,11)his hopes(353,9) all(357,8) frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did
shrug his shoulders, it(1391,9)till(244,13)was out of sight.

Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his
forbearance; and(618,8)(97,12),(1910,11)(1175,11), stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarit(1464,8)(1867,9)
good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak,(753,10)be
vulgar. Nor was her respect for him(841,10)t made her more quiet, at
all likely to mak(38,11)elegant.(1349,11)did all sh(702,8)to
shield him from the(568,9) notice of ei(424,9) was ever(1135,11)

converse without mortification(499,13)the uncomfortable(1998,8)s
arising from all this took(224,10)s(1512,9)courtship much of its
(1242,8), it added to the hop(1229,8) future; and she looked forward
with(1872,8)(63,8)time when they should be removed from society so
little pleasing to(394,9)(1261,11)comfort and eleganc(1395,11)family party at Pemberley.




[Illustration]




CHAPTER LXI.(34,19)Happy for all her maternal(391,9) was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid(1790,8)two most deserving daughters. With what(337,8)ed pride she
afterwards visited Mrs.(947,8), and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be
guessed. I wish I could say, for the sak(710,15), that the
accomplishment(2004,8)earnest desire(1969,8)estab(43,12)so many of
her children produced so happy an effect as(1012,13)a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman(206,9)res(167,9)life; though(1414,10)
it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous
and invariably silly.

Mr(591,9)mi(1809,9)second(575,9) exceedingly; his affection(213,8)
drew him oftener from home than anything els(2042,8)do. He(657,11)in
going to(868,10), especially when he was least expected(205,8)ingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations(1996,9)desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_(324,10)ate heart. The darling wish of his
sister(1044,9)n gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshi(1401,8)Jane and(1767,10), in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty,(342,8)very material advantage, spent the chief(1251,9)ime with
(1265,8)elder sisters. In(1531,11) superior to w(808,8)had generally
known, her improvement was great. She(481,9)of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia; and,(1679,14)the influence of Lydia’s example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. F(1978,8)further dis(369,9)(147,11)
(1851,9)he was(2019,8)se carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent(941,8)going.

Mary(1863,9)only(1234,10)who(1050,13)home; and(248,9)necessarily
drawn(459,10)pursuit of (1717,14)s by(1955,12)’s being quite
unable to sit alone. (165,9)obliged to mix more(281,10)world, but
sh(1344,8)still moralize over every morning visit; and as(219,10)o
longer mortified by comparisons between h(862,10)’ beauty and her own(1762,9)suspected by(422,12)(1695,10)ubmitted to the change without
much reluctance.

As for(598,8) and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage(1966,8)(1072,9)He b(360,9)philosophy the conviction that
(1311,9) must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of
everything,(1655,9)wholly(330,8) hope that Darcy might yet be
prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which(263,11)recei(1252,9)Lydia on her(369,10)explained(1865,8)that, by
his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The
(154,8)as to this effect:--

     /* “My dear Lizzy, */

     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear
    (1275,8), you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you
     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
     think of us. I am sure(840,9)would like a place at court very
     mu(134,8)I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon(665,9)some help. Any place would do of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however,(160,8)speak to(441,11)about it,
     if you had rather not.

“Yours,” etc.

As it happened that (1021,10)had much(67,11), she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief(244,11)as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy(72,8)own private expenses, she(2007,12)sent them. It had always been evid(1934,11)that such an
income as theirs, under the direc(257,9)wo persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless(316,8)future,(908,14)insufficient to
their support(884,10)ever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards
discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restor(580,9)peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were(476,8)moving from place to place in quest of a
cheap situation, an(545,9)spending more than they ought. His affection
for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a(348,8)long(1856,8)
(1856,11) her youth and he(341,8)s, she retained all the claims to
reputation which(1768,14)had given her. Though Darcy could never
receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for(1133,10)’s sake, h(559,8)ed him
further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when
her husband was gone to enjo(1926,9) in London or Bat(1696,8)ith the
Bingleys they both of them (1077,12)tayed so long, that even(64,8)’s good-humour was overcome(997,8) proceeded so far as to _talk_
of giving them a hint to be gone.

Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s(484,9); but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting(495,15)she
dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to(1789,8)s heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to(1771,10).

(670,9) was now(126,10)’s home; and the attachment(1729,8)sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to se(1140,14)ble to love each
other, even as well as they intended.(285,10) had the highest opinion
in the world of(2010,10); though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive(1475,10)
talking(1830,8)brother. He, who(1878,12)inspired in (1644,8)a respect
which(523,8)overcame her(1354,10), she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge(1274,8)ad never before fallen in
her way. By(1223,13)instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with (1203,11), which a(318,8) will not
always allow in a sister(1656,12)en years young(871,8)himself.

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the(1547,10)of her nephew;
and as she gave way to(1633,9)genuine frankness(1702,8)character,(344,8)reply to the letter(257,8)nnounced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially(788,13), that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, b(521,14)persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little (1826,8)resistance(425,8)part of his aunt, her
(1402,10)(423,9), either(931,8)(847,9) for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted(957,8); and she condescended to wait on
them(1583,15)in spite of that pollution which its woods had
(957,8), not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visit(656,9)uncle and aunt(75,10)city.
