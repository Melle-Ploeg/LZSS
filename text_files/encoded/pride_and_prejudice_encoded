PREFACE.

(704,13)]


_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving
by allowance” and(26,8) with personal love.” This(80,13)applies
to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
numerous authors who are the objects(53,8)(155,9)affection, it
brings a curious consequence(212,6)it. There is much more difference as
to their best work than(190,18)ose othe(173,11)loved “by
(347,11)by conven(170,6)and because it is felt to b(238,6)right and
proper thing to love them. A(336,10)sect--fairly larg(513,6)yet
unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be
found partisan(389,9)claim to primacy(933,6)most every on(486,8)
novels. To som(468,6)delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger
Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscu(576,7)undoubted
critical facts that its scale is small(421,6)(24,6)heme, after all, that
of burlesque or parody, a ki(746,6)which the first rank is reached with
difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone(576,6)not enthralling
in interest, has devotee(839,6)exalt above all(851,6)(697,6)its exquisite
delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly
theatrical, the hero(476,6)eroine are insipid(785,6)the(1018,7) has(585,7)
wickedly destroyed all romantic(244,9) by expressly(137,7)ing(427,6)Edmund only took Fanny(899,9)Mary shocked him(144,8)at(41,7)might
very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
yet the matchless rehearsal-scene(773,6)the characters of Mrs. Norris and
(449,7)have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and
Sensibility _has perhaps(699,6)ewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
not want them._

_I suppose, however(827,6)(254,7)jority of at least competent votes
would,(690,7)ings(210,9)ed, be divided between_ Emma _(592,8)present
book; and(219,13)vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss
Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possibl(460,6)ge
of(120,7)ity) would go for(189,6). _It i(381,6)larg(310,6)(583,7)varied, the
more popular;(831,14)d by the time(172,7) composition seen rather(72,6)of the worl(912,7)had improved her gener(976,6)ough not her most
peculiar and(695,10)istic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the
Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,
I, for my part, declare(361,6)Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It
seems to m(128,6)most perfect(406,8)st(240,15)(25,10)
eminently quintessential(403,8)(433,6)’s works(674,6)for this contention
in(315,6)narrow space as is permitted(167,6), I propose here to show
cause(919,6)(301,6)first place(609,6)book (it may be barely necessary to remi(860,6)
reader) was in its(83,7)shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
when(522,6)(867,7)was(125,8)twenty-one;(631,8)it was revised and
finished at Chawton some fifteen years later(733,6)was not publ(59,6)till
1813, only four(56,7)before her death. I do not know whether, in this
combination(857,8)fresh and vigorous projec(37,8)youth(890,6)the
critical(232,6)(73,7)middle lif(435,6)re(428,8)traced the distinct
superiority in point of construction, which, as it (752,11), it
possesses over all(872,10)s. The plot,(412,8)not elaborate, is almost
regular enough for Fielding; hardly a(840,10),(20,9)n incident
could be retrenched without loss to the story(157,6)elopeme(248,6)Lydia
and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de
théâtre; _it connects itself(522,6)e strictest way with the course(539,7)
sto(803,7)i(671,8)brings(806,7)the denou(202,6)with complete propriety.
A(414,7)minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley(1019,6)adv(293,7)Mr.
Collins(27,6)visit to Hunsford(50,6)Derbyshire tour--fit in after(215,6)ame unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There(398,6) attempt at the
hide-and-seek, in-and-out business(707,7)(371,8)transactions between
Frank Churchill and(266,6)Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal(604,7)
intrigue of_ Emma, _but(64,13)(265,7)(223,8)(159,7)I do not think
the best featur(525,7)at(860,6)wise admirable book. Al(870,7)Miss Austen
always liked something(603,7) misunderstanding kind(305,8)afforded her
opportunities for(631,6)isplay(79,8)peculiar and incompa(162,6)talent to
be noticed presently, she has been satisfi(122,6)e(791,10)perfectly
natural occasions provided by the false accou(990,6)Darcy’s conduct given
by(1005,8)(857,7)(62,6)awkwardness (arising(927,6)equal (128,7)ness) from
the gradual(611,6)formation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive
aversion to actual love.(541,10)know wheth(838,6) all-grasping hand of
the playwright has ever(350,6)laid upon_ Prid(1006,6)Prejudice; _and I dare
say that, if it were(1015,6)situa(837,6)would prove not startling or
garish enough(568,9)footlights(78,6)character-scheme too subtle and
delicate for pit and gallery. But i(721,6)attemp(169,6) made, it(162,6)
certainly not be hamper(564,6)an(710,7)ose loosenesses of construction,
which,(844,6)imes disguis(636,10)convenienc(64,6)(993,6)the novelist can
avail himself, appear at once on(360,6)tage._

_I think, however, (1007,7)the(11,7)t will doubtless seem heretical to
more than one school of critics, that(242,13) is not the highest
merit(443,8)oicest gift,(324,6)(233,10). It sets off his other gifts
and graces most advantageously to(541,6)ri(191,6)eye; and the wa(984,6)it
will(400,11)mar(456,7)(92,6)--appreciably(310,9)not quite
consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-(135,8)(624,6)a very badly-built
novel(493,7)excelled in pathetic or humorous(754,10), or(546,6)
displayed consummate comm(983,6) dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all
faculties--(920,6)be an infinitely better thing(522,6)a faul(562,6)plot
acted(362,6)old by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the
ability(769,7)Miss Austen has shown in working ou(614,6)story, I for one
should put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what
seem to me the(448,6)masterpie(939,7)(164,11)’s humour (383,7)her(351,7)y of(450,10)-creation--(79,13)who may indeed admit John
Thorpe(832,6)Eltons, Mrs. Norris,(114,6)ne or two(820,6)s(784,7)ir company,
but who, i(976,6)instance certainly(76,6)(560,8)in(76,7), are still
superior(880,7)m._

_The(676,10)istic(288,27)re so subtl(411,6)delicate
that they are,(136,8), at all (945,6)easier to apprehend(665,6)to
expres(275,7)at any particular time likely to be differently
(79,9)ed by(27,10) persons. T(527,7)i(493,9)seems to possess a
greater affinity, on the whole,(408,6)at of Addison(191,8) any(446,6) of
the numerous speci(629,6)this great British genus. Th(209,10)(674,6)
scheme, of ti(9,7)subject, of literary convention,(381,6)of course,
obvious enough; t(104,13) of sex does not(440,11)count for much,
for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in
Jane(887,10)genius(88,10), though nothing mannish, much(380,6)was
masculine. But th(539,6)ness of quality consists in a(376,7)numb(421,6)common subdivision(61,12)--demureness, extreme minut(104,9)touch,
avoida(335,7)loud tones and glaring effects. Also(329,7)is in both a
(968,7) not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those
who judge gross(812,6)contras(296,6)good nature(711,12)(68,7)e
savagery of Swift, the mild(351,8)Miss(452,7)(56,9) boisterousness
of Fielding and Smollett, ev(55,12)ferocious practical jokes that
her immediate predecessor,(134,6)Burney, allowed without very much
protest. Yet,(365,6)in Mr.(962,9)(666,6)(214,13)(416,8)(656,9)a
restrained and well-mannered, an insat(427,6)and ruthless delight in
roast(274,8)cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,
(991,10) could push this taste further than a lady(86,13)
nine(86,6); and no doubt(475,12)’s principles, as well as her heart,
would have shrunk from s(942,6)ings a(684,6)letter(31,6)the unfortunate
husb(390,7)the_ Spectator, _who describes,(748,6)all(716,6)usto and(18,8)
innocence(326,8)world, how his wif(415,6)his friend induce him to play
at blind-man’s-buff. But another(163,11) _(218,6)--that of the damsel
of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely,(200,6)ssure(355,6)selected

written by a rather more ladylik(694,6)intelligent Lydia Bennet(661,7)

think unreasonably)(579,6)found “cynicism” in touches of(669,14)
own,(617,6)(659,7)satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over
her son(479,6)this wor(133,8)al” is one(473,8)most misuse(688,8)
English language, especially when,(374,6)glar(1022,8)gratuitous
falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and
snarling invective, but to gentl(758,6)oblique(299,7). If (365,8) means
the percep(142,8)“(455,10)side,” the(151,6)(31,9)accepted hells
beneath(43,7)consciousness(710,6)motives are nearly always mixed, and
that to seem is not identical with to be--if(442,6)be(207,9), then
every man and woma(905,6)(79,7)a fool, who doe(100,6)care to live in a
fool’s paradise(48,6)has knowledge of natur(839,6)the world and life, is
a(366,6). An(573,7)at(330,7)(732,11) certainly was one. She may even
(981,9) one(922,7) fur(420,6)ense that, like her own Mr.(973,7), she
took an epicurean delight in dissecting,(15,7)play(15,8)setting at
work her fools and her mean persons. I (1011,6)she did take(876,6)(115,7),
and I do(730,6)hink at all(332,8)(622,6)(106,6)r it as a(466,6), while she
was immensely the bett(54,14)n artist._

_In respect(96,8)art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observe(684,7)“metaphor has(417,6)exhausted in depicting (870,7)fec(1012,10),

microcosm, the cosmic quality(534,6) is at least as eminent as the
littleness. She does(835,6)ouch what(886,9)not feel herself called to(494,6);(249,13)sure(246,6)she coul(592,6)have(367,6)ed(96,17)

even(532,6)black one._

_For if her knowledg(489,6)not very extended, she knew two things(307,7)only genius knows. The on(565,6)humanity, an(869,6)other(708,6)rt. On the
first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though(473,6)ed, are
true(106,6)her women are, i(352,6)old(434,6), “absolute.” As to art, if she
has never tried idealism, her r(13,6) is real to a degree(792,8)akes
the false(50,9)of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any
Frenchman, excep(968,6)late M. de Maupassant(361,6)watch him laboriously
piling up strokes(280,8)hope of giving a complete impression. You get
none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can
shape a(324,6)(105,10) out of the rest. But(893,6)(837,11) the
myriad, trivial, unforced(225,9)build up the picture like magic.
Nothing is(427,6); n(18,10)superfluous. When (to take(80,6)resent book
only) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.
Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. (54,8)ould have
stirre(882,6)fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_
himself,” _the touch in each case is(328,6)that of Swift--“taller by the
breadth of my nail”--(804,6)(603,7)(165,7)half-reluctant Thackeray with
just and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I
should put(583,13)as near to(194,6) in some ways, as I have put her
to Addison in others._

_This(262,6)ian quality appear(874,9)(563,8)novel(166,7)(35,7)

draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The
formality(722,6)under-breeding(742,6)meanness, are(506,6); but(850,6)ortrait
is only half (536,7)and is felt to be even a little unnatural.(833,12) is perfectly (34,7)(77,6)(23,10)alive. In fact, for all the
“miniature,”(682,6) is some(871,6)gigantic(998,8)way in which a certain

(286,7)ed if his creatress ha(174,6)adjusted so artfully to him the

perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the(83,7)(1013,6)it seems to me

birth, as overbearing, a(753,6)-centred, as neglectful of good manners,
as(397,15). A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady
Powerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,
rich, long out of marital author(825,9)so forth, had opportunities of
developing(836,7)agreeabl(479,6)acteristics which seldom present
themselves now. As for(713,11), Miss Austen(972,6)Mr. Darc(987,7)even

her privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of
first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of pla(48,8)

perhaps poor Mary was(425,8)the scapegoat of(754,6)ins of blue stockings

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in(806,6)of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this(218,7)is so well fixed i(113,6)minds
of the surrounding families(251,7)he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other (97,6)ir daughters.

“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?”

(99,10) replie(59,6) he had not.

“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has j(481,6)en here, and she
told me all about it.(131,14)made no answer.

This was invitation enough.

“What is his name?”

“Bingley.”

“Is he married or singl(40,6)Oh,(15,7)(467,11)to be sure! A(46,7)(421,21);(351,6)or

I do not pretend(791,7)any(715,6)extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over(654,14)er own(148,7)(970,6)n such cases,(106,13)not often much(201,7) to(737,6) of.”

“Mr. Bennet, how can(241,6)buse(977,6)own children in(418,6)a way? You take

CHAPTER V.(69,16)]

Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family(999,6)(680,8)(803,7)s
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas(1003,10)forme(46,6) trade
in Meryton, w(1001,6)(1004,6)made a tolerable fortune(724,6)rise(322,7)e
honour of knighthood by an address(42,7) king during his mayoralty. The
distin(936,6)had, perhaps,(190,7)elt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business(550,6)(20,6)residence (394,6)mall market town;
and, quitting them both,(286,8)removed(414,6)his(430,8)to a house about
a mile from(361,10)denominated(26,6)that period(435,7)Lodge;(403,9)
could(688,7)with pleasure of his own importanc(422,6), unshackled by
(267,8), occupy himself sole(533,6)being civil to all the world. For,
though elat(858,6)his rank, it di(995,6)render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all atten(924,8)everybody. By nature inoffensive,
friendly(659,6)obliging, his present(1002,6)at St. James’(783,6)made him
courteous.

Lady(819,7)was a very good kind of woman, no(650,6)clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs.(954,7). They had several children. The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young(142,8)about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth’s intimate (310,6).

That the Miss(631,6)e(807,7)(21,8)(181,6)s should meet to talk over a
ball(449,6)bsolutely necessary;(79,9)morning after the assembly
brough(139,6)form(336,6)Longbourn to hear(961,8)communicate.

“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said(396,12),(958,6)civil
self-command, to(277,11). (101,7)were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”

“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”

“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced(1021,6)her twice. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something(610,7)it--but I hardly know what--(44,9)
(654,6)Mr. Robinson.”

“Perhaps(237,10)what I over(111,6)between him and(67,13): did not
I mention it to you?(110,13)’s asking him how he liked our Meryton
(640,7)ies, and whether he(107,8) think there(509,6)a great many pretty
women i(638,6)room(79,6)_which_ he th(737,10)prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh,(743,6)ldest(934,12),
beyond a doubt:(185,7)cannot be two opinions on(560,6)point.’”

“Upon my word! Well,(596,6)was very decided, (581,6)--that does(626,8)
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing(762,6)know.”

“_My_(527,9)ings(882,6)more(271,8)purpose than _yours_, Eliza(994,7)

is he? Poor(96,6)! to be only just _tolerable_.”

“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head(76,7)vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable ma(448,7)it would be quite
a misfortune(180,7)(766,6)by him. Mrs. Long told m(614,7)ni(677,6)at he

“Are you(238,6) sure, ma’am? I(486,6)(946,6)a little mistake?(545,6) Jane.
“I certainly saw (556,10)speak(534,7)her.”

“Ay, because she asked him at(933,6)how h(363,8)Netherfield,(1001,6)e
could not help (1015,10)her; but she(163,6)he seemed(887,6)angry at being
spoke to.”

“Miss Bingley(464,8)(779,7) Jane, “(467,7) never(222,6)s much unless
amo(443,7)intimate acquaintance. With _them_(660,7)remarkably
(661,9)(773,7)do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so ver(77,11), he(730,7)have talked to(703,10). But I can guess how it
was; everybody says(728,8) is eat up with pride(419,6)I dare say(154,7)

if I we(901,6)(499,7)(492,7)(904,7), I may safely promis(948,6)_never_ to(90,12)him.”

“His(401,7)(231,20)(369,9)offend _me_ so(714,6)a(58,7)
often does(945,10)there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder(553,6)so
very fine a young man,(566,6)family, fortune,(621,6)thing in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If(302,8)o express it,(797,6)s a _right_
to be proud.”

“That is very true,” replied(500,6)beth, “(731,6)could easily forgive
_his_(771,8)i(913,9)not mortified _mine_.”

“P(412,7)observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidit(244,6)er
reflections, “is a(193,6)common failing, (596,9). By all(961,6)I have

quality or (901,7)real or imaginary. Vanity and(805,6) are different
things, though the words are (790,6)used synonymously. A person may be
proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves; v(175,6)to what we would have(230,6)s(790,7)of us.”

“If I were as ri(984,6)Mr. Darcy,” cried(913,9)Lucas(640,6)came(924,6)his
sisters, “I (897,7)not care how(838,6) I was. I(153,7)keep a pack of

CHAPTER VI.(33,19)The ladies of Longbourn soon waited(856,6)ose of Netherfield. T(141,8)
was returned in due form. Miss (379,6)’s pleasing manners grew(953,7)
good-will of Mrs. Hurst and(71,7)ingley(295,8)(909,9)mother was
found to be intolerable(617,6)the(735,6)er (712,7) not worth speaking to,
a wish of(937,7)better acquainte(969,6) _them_ was expressed towards the
two eldest. By Jane this attention (316,6)ceiv(86,8)the(729,6)est
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
everybody, hardly excepting even h(279,9)(920,6)c(990,9)like them;
(375,10)ir kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,
in all probability, from the influence of(203,7)brother’s admi(756,6). I(635,6)generally evident, whenever they met,(923,6)he _did_(71,6)e her; and
to _her_(187,7) equ(82,12)(985,6)Jane was yield(557,6) the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him(239,10)first(675,6)was in a
way(711,7)very much in lov(522,7)she consider(655,8)(556,8)(235,6)(920,7)(449,8)l(81,8)discovered by the world in(329,8), since Jane
uni(752,9)great strength of feeling, a composur(438,6)emper and an
uniform cheerfulness of manner, (308,6)would guard her(528,9)
suspicions(529,7) impertinent. She m(846,6)ed(863,6)to(66,7)iend, Miss
Lucas.

“It may, perhaps, be(315,6)ant,” replied Charlotte, “(395,6)able to impose
on(508,6)ublic in(766,7) cas(943,7)it is sometimes a disadvantage(481,6)
so(484,6)guarded. If a woman conceals her affection(494,6)the same skill
(830,9)object of it, she may lose(31,6)pportunity of fixing him(776,6)it will then be but poor consolation(666,6)liev(83,6)(576,6)(818,8)in the
dark. There(261,6)(709,6)of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachmen(953,8)(331,6)not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight(941,11) is natural enough(861,6)there are
very few of us who have heart(52,7)(937,7)re(255,8)love without
encouragement. In nine cases out(814,6)n,(500,9)had better show _more_
(510,10)than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly(657,6)he
may never do more(80,6)like her, if she doe(368,6)help him on.”

“But(33,10)(29,11), as(484,6)a(688,6)nature(591,6)allow. If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too.”

“Remember, Eliza(573,7)(207,12)know Jane’s disposition as you d(72,6)But i(904,10)is partial to a man, and(294,10)endeavor to(950,8)

“Perhaps(234,8), if he sees(599,8)of her. But though(491,9)and Jane
meet tolerably often,(813,8)ever for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed(258,6)es(95,8)impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing(136,9). Jane(48,7)
therefore make the most of (95,6)half hour in which sh(1012,6)command his
attention. Whe(814,6)is secure of(614,6)(999,6)will be leisure for falling
(973,8)(730,11)she chooses.”

“Your pl(549,6)a good one,” replied(650,6)beth, “where nothing is in
question but the desi(167,6)being well married(440,6)if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any(16,10)I dare say I(424,8)adopt it. But
these a(169,6)(812,8)feelings;(333,8)not acting by design. As yet she
cannot even be certain of(229,7)gre(396,6)er own regard, nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight(36,6)danced four
dances with him at Meryton(203,6)saw(74,7)e morning at his own house,
and has since din(722,8)mpany(94,10)four times. This(298,8)quite
(986,7)to(736,6)her underst(698,7) character.”

“Not as you represen(423,6)Had she merely _dined_(229,9),(29,6)ight
only have discovered whether he had(696,8)appetite; but you must
remember that(226,6)evenings(89,6)been also spent(989,9)--an(390,7)(49,9)may do a great deal(840,6)es: (634,6)(98,19)enabled them to as(591,8)that they both

leading(394,10)istic, I do not imagine(270,6)much has(260,6)unfolded.”

“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane succes(670,7)all my heart(1000,8)

twelvemonth. H(73,9)in(155,6)age is entirely a matter of (129,6). If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well(1004,7)to each(420,6), or
(37,8)similar beforehand, it doe(890,6)advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to

sound, and(1020,6)you would never act(329,6)is way yourself.”

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting(1016,6)she was herself becoming an object of some
interes(176,7)e eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy(832,6)t first scarcely
allowed h(452,6)be pretty: (883,7)looked at her without admiration at the
ball(994,6)when they next met, he(73,15)only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and(233,11)s(317,10)had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to fi(724,6)was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though(397,7)
detected(820,6)a(318,7)al eye more(215,6)one failu(951,6)perfect symmetry

to dance with.

H(613,11)wish to know(433,6)(559,6); and, as a step towards conversing
with(197,6)(771,6), attend(438,6)her(45,8)(920,6)with(602,7). His doing so
drew her notice. I(758,6)at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were
assembled.

“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
(195,18)Colonel Forster?”

“That is a ques(239,6)hich(123,11)only can answer.”

“But if he(168,6)it any more, I shall certainly let him(428,6)that I see
w(721,6) is about. He has a (989,6)atir(918,8)(571,6)if I do not begin by

[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George

On(952,6)pproach(954,6)em(132,6)afterwards,(763,7) without seem(447,7)have
any intention of speaking, Miss(598,6) defied her friend to m(53,7)such
a subject to him,(482,7)immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turn(800,7)im and said,--

“Di(972,6)you think,(698,10),(497,8)expressed(413,7) uncommonly well
just now, when I was teasing(700,16) to give us a ball at
Meryton?”

“With great energy; but i(750,7)(275,8)(749,6)always makes a lady
energetic.”

“You are(524,6)e on us.”

“It will be _her_ turn(624,6)to be teased(956,8)(442,10). “I am going
to open the instrument,(399,6)(763,6)you(834,6)what follow(132,6)(157,8)(823,8)trange creature by way of a(549,7)!--(244,7)wanting me
to play(477,6)ing before anybod(24,6)everybody! If my vanity had taken a
musical turn, you would have been invaluable(406,6)as(409,6), I(44,6)
really rather not sit down(150,8)those who must be i(319,6)habit of
hear(894,7)(281,6)best performers.” On(844,11)’s persevering, however,
she added, “Ver(688,6); if it(126,9)so,(15,8).” And gravely glancing
at(792,12)“There(655,6)very fine old saying(936,8)(371,9) (48,7)
of course familiar with--‘Keep your brea(965,6)cool(20,6)porridge,’--and
I shall keep mine to swell my song.”

Her(309,8)ance was pl(920,6), though by no means capital. After a song
or two(715,6)(601,7)she could reply to the entreaties of(882,6)al that she
(589,6)sing again, sh(150,6)eagerly succeeded at(850,15) by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of be(581,8)only plain one in
th(388,7)y, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was (900,6)
impatient for display.

Mar(858,6)neither genius nor taste; and(387,8)(906,11)given her
application, it(30,14) likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner(655,8)(972,11)injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more(646,6)ure(646,9)not playing half so(940,7)and(493,7)(531,6)
end of a long(237,6)rto(407,6)glad to purchase prais(456,6)gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs(99,8) request of her younger (635,6)s(631,6)with
some of the Lucases(808,6)two or th(342,6)ficers, joined(751,9)in
dancing at one (221,7)the room.

Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
pass(777,8)even(1022,6)(946,7)xclusion of all convers(632,7)and was too(446,6)engrossed by his own(711,7)ts to perceive(1014,6)Sir William(288,6)
was his neighbour, till(42,13)thus began:--

“What a charming amusem(886,8)young people this is, (311,9)! There is
nothing like (377,7), after all. I consider it as on(479,9)first
refinements of polished societies.”

“Certainly, sir(1004,6)it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less(104,19)(630,8)world: every savage can dance.”

(387,12)only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
continued(299,9) pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
not(534,6)you are an adept (53,7)science yourself(454,11).”

“You saw m(446,6)e at Meryton, I believe, sir(48,6)es, indeed(918,6)received no in(492,8)able pleasure from(142,6)ight. Do
you ofte(342,7) at St. James’s?”

“Never(122,10)Do you (242,6)ink it would be a proper compliment(911,8)place?”

“It is a(36,12)which I never pay to any(54,6) if I can avoid it(308,9)have a house in town,(749,6)clude?”

(816,9) bowed.

“I had once some(999,10)of fix(690,7)town my(432,6)for I am fond of
superior(801,7)y; but I did not feel quite c(821,6)(547,6)the air of
London(319,7)agree with Lady Lucas.”

He(662,6)d in hop(802,6)an answer: but his companion was not disposed to
make any(948,6)Elizabeth a(699,7)instant moving towards them, he was
struck(165,6)the notion of doing a very gallan(545,6)g(672,6)called out to
her,--

“My dear Miss(148,6), why are no(848,6)dancing?(819,10), you must allow
me to prese(119,6)s young lady t(691,6)as(160,8)desi(796,7)artner. You
cannot refuse to(907,6),(503,6)sure, when so much beauty is before you.”
And, taking her hand(322,6)ould(691,6)given it to(215,12)who,(653,7)
extremely surprised,(473,9)unwill(424,6)(1020,8) it(161,8)he(463,8)ly

CHAPTER VII.(103,16)]

“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two

I am now convinced.”

Catherine was disconcerted(894,6)made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continu(611,6)express her admir(476,6)of Captain Car(1007,8)

“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. (471,6), “that you should be so

Mrs(719,8) was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman(470,6)a
note for(191,6)(801,6); it came(900,6)Netherfield, and(792,7)rvant waited
for an answer. (159,11)’s eyes sparkled(591,6)pleasure(81,6)she was
eagerly calling out, while her(1004,9) read,--

She did at last extort from he(327,9)an acknowledgment tha(521,6)(439,6)

When dinner was over, she returned directly to(755,7)and(329,13)
began abusing h(455,7)oon(463,8)was out(865,8)room. Her manners were
pronounced to be(467,6)bad(754,8)--a mixtu(940,6)pride and impertinence:

thought the sam(245,7)added,--

“Yes(787,6)her petticoat; I hope you saw(30,14), six inches deep

“Your picture may(717,9)exact(398,8),” said(839,8); “but(490,6)was

She was still(951,6)poorly(859,6)Elizabeth (522,10)quit her at all, till
late(427,8)evening, when she had the comfort of seeing(73,6)sleep, and
when it appea(247,12)(1020,6)right than pleasant(932,6)she should go

below,(538,6)a book. Mr. Hurst looked a(481,6)(37,6)stonishment.

“Do you prefer reading to cards?”(162,6)he; “that is(444,8)singular.”

“Miss(607,6) Bennet,(58,7)Miss(966,8), “despises(95,6). She is a great

where a few books were lying. He(814,13)offe(980,7)fetch her

“And I wish my collection(114,7)arger for(340,6)benefit(851,6)y own

“N(54,6)!(950,15)(77,8)nothing(722,6)can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, w(252,8)build _your_ house,(777,8)it may be

“But I would really advis(205,6)to make(849,6)purchase in that

“Upon my word, Caroline, I(865,8)think it more(74,7)le to ge(815,11) by(324,10)than by imitation.”

Elizabeth was(743,9)caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table(483,6)s(176,6)ed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.

“Is Miss(429,7)much grown sinc(43,6)spring?” said(46,6)(108,7): “will
she be as tall as I am?(1018,6)(420,6)she will. Sh(643,7)w about(128,6)(385,10)Bennet’s height, or
rather taller.”

“How I long to se(394,6)again! I never met with anybody who(934,8)ed me

“Yes, all of them, (502,7). T(113,8)paint tables, cover screen(347,6)

being informed that(704,6)as(343,18).”

“Your list(259,7) common extent of(557,11)ments(476,8)Darcy, “has

“Nor I,(205,6)sur(841,9)Miss(846,8).

“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal(262,8)

“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can b(272,8)

“I am no longer surprised at(982,6)(931,8)_only_ six(728,17)en.

bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. A(932,6)conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.

“Eliza Bennet,” sai(368,14)(228,7)the door was closed on her, “is

sex by undervalu(414,6)eir own;(450,6)ith(419,6)men, I daresay, it
succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”

“Undoubtedly,” re(585,6)Darcy,(422,6)om(529,6)remark(281,6)hiefly addressed,
“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which(305,8)sometimes condescend

CHAPTER IX.(113,16)](968,12)pass(968,6) chief(724,8)night in(966,11)’s room,(629,6)n the
(574,7) ha(68,6)pleasure of(942,7)able to send a tol(503,6) answer(305,7)
inquiries which she very(685,7)received from M(645,11)by a(441,6)maid,
and some time(552,6)wards(58,6)the two elegant lad(116,6)o waited on his
(703,7). In spit(1005,7)is amendment, (664,9)she requested to have a
not(888,7)to Longbourn, desiring her moth(265,6)visit Jane(357,6)form her
own judgment of(593,7)tuation. The note was immediately despatched, and
its contents (958,6)ckly complied with. Mrs.(654,7), accompanied by her
(666,18), reached Netherfield soon(939,7)the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger,(149,12) would(357,6)been
very mis(603,6); but(639,7)satisfi(473,6)see(373,8)that her illness was

home; neither di(1003,6)apothecary, who arrived about the sa(835,7), think
it at all advisable. Aft(650,6)ting a little while with(717,7)on Miss
(949,7)’s appearance and invitatio(234,6)(788,8)and three(237,9)s all
attended(450,6)nto the(601,10) parlour. (113,7) met them(149,6)hopes
that(598,13)(493,6)t(653,7)Miss(624,10)rse than she expected.

“Indeed I have, sir,” w(525,6) answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not(392,6) of mov(711,7). W(33,7)trespass
(389,9)longer on your kindness.”

“Removed!” cried(295,8). “It(113,10)be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear(804,10)moval.”

“You may depend upon it, madam,” sai(365,8)(542,6),(570,6)cold civility,
“(431,6)(405,11)shall receive every possible attention(653,7)she
remains(665,6)us.”

(511,12)was profuse in(448,6)cknowledgments.

“I am sure,” she added, “if i(68,6)(579,6)r such good friends, I do not
know what (1002,6)become(319,7),(63,6)(563,6)very ill indeed, and suffers a

always(27,6)ay(803,7)(135,12)has(405,6)out excep(938,10)sweetest
temper I ever met with. I often tell my (986,6)girls they are nothing to

over that gravel walk.(387,9) know a pla(282,10)country(55,6)is
equal to Netherfield(155,6)(759,9)(918,9)quitting it in a hurry, I
hope(415,9)y(216,8)but a short lease.”

“Whatever(555,6)is done(80,12)” replied he; “and therefore if I
should resolve to quit(195,12), I (38,7)probably be off in five
minutes. At present, howev(1024,6)consider myself as quite fixed her(208,6)T(330,6) exactly(756,6)(126,9)have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.

“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cr(279,6), turn(591,6)wards her.

“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”

“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through, I am afraid, is pitiful(285,13)as it happens. It does not necessarily follow(724,6)a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”

“Lizzy,(327,10)r mother, “remember where you are(892,6)(847,7)run on in
the wild mann(900,8)(51,7) suffered to do at hom(763,6)I did(923,10)before,” continued(1012,10)immediately, “(97,9)were

(249,21). “I assu(676,7)(168,9)quite as much of _that_
going(695,6) t(420,10) as in town.”

Everybody was surprised; an(456,9)after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.(253,14)who fancied she had ga(440,6) complete
victory over him,(803,11)her triumph,--

“I cannot see(907,6)London has any gre(688,12)(86,6)(269,11), for
my part, except the shops and public places. (751,11) is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr.(990,8)?”

“When I am(410,15),” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and
w(70,13)own, it is pretty(526,6)the same(972,12)ea(25,6)ir

gentleman,”(593,12)(617,7)“seemed to think(696,13)was nothing
at all.”

“I(880,6) mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. “You(847,7)mistook Mr.(774,6). He only mean(206,6)(900,7)(153,7)
such a variety of people to be met with(912,26), which
you must acknowledg(69,8)true.”

“Certainly, my dear, nobody(240,6)(155,7)ere; but as to not meeting with
many(167,8)in this neighbourhood, I belie(477,6)re are few
(39,13)s larger. I know we dine(242,6)four-and-twenty families.”

N(467,6) but concern for(433,10) could enable(841,8) to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate(742,6)directed her eye towards
(493,9)(424,6)a very expressive smile.(588,12)for(869,7)ke of
saying some(215,6)that might turn her (624,6)’s thoughts, now ask(149,7)if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.

“Yes, she called yesterda(221,7)her fa(760,6)What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr.(382,8)--is not he? so much th(56,6)of fashion! so
genteel and so easy! He has always(302,12)o say to everybody. _That_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important and never open their mouths quite mistake(221,7)tter.”

“Did (418,10)(745,10)you?”

“No(380,6)would go home. I(146,7)she was wanted about(320,6)ince-pies. For
my part(381,13), _I_(315,8)keep servants(621,6)can do(205,7)own

judge(751,8)(335,7)(847,6)th(676,7)e(86,6)(823,7)good sort of girls, I
assure you. It is a pity they are(599,6)andsome! Not(835,6)_I_ think(794,11)so _very_ plain; b(327,6)n she is our particular friend.”

“She seems(998,8)pleasant young woman,” said(758,8).

“Oh dear, yes(112,6)you must ow(120,9)(82,7)ain. Lady(964,8)erself
has often(95,6)so(329,6)envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child(255,7)o be sure, Jane--one doe(945,6)(119,7)ee anybody

sister-in-law was sure (893,9)make her an offer before we came away.
But, however, he did not. Perhaps he th(817,6)her too(556,6). H(55,10)
wrote some verses on(177,6)and(619,7)ret(754,8)were.”

“And so ended his affectio(646,9)Elizabeth, impati(942,7)“There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first

“I have been used to consider(61,8)as the _food_ of love(876,8)Darc(874,6)f a fine, stout, health(109,6) it may. Everything nourishe(702,7)is
strong already. But if it be(671,6)a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced(633,6)one good sonnet will star(155,6)entirely(605,6)”

Darcy(786,6)smiled; an(351,6)general pause which ensued made(504,10)
tremble les(644,6)m(824,6)should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of no(331,6)to say(164,6)after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeat(125,7) thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane,(985,6)an apolog(42,6)troubling him also(1024,6)Lizzy.(89,13)was

indeed(217,6)out much graciousness(385,6)Mrs. (328,7)was satisfied, and
soon(386,6)wards order(104,7)carriage. Upon this signal, the(223,7)st of
her daughters put(546,9)forward. The two girls had(966,6)whisper(534,6)

into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen(662,8) fine complexion
and good-humoured(128,6)enance; a favourite(203,7)(940,9), whose
(682,6)ion(361,6)rough(980,6)into public at an early age(968,6)had high
animal spirits(734,6)a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of(737,6)fficers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her
own easy ma(25,6)recommend(784,6), had increased(225,6)assuranc(212,7)was

the most shameful thing i(119,6)world if he did not keep it. His answer
to(919,7)udden attack was delightful to(545,11)’s ear.

“I am perfec(200,6)ady, I(315,6)e you, to(119,6)my engagemen(899,6), when

added, “I(330,6) insist(668,7)ir giving one also. (41,8)tell Colonel

Mrs. Bennet(904,8) daughters then departed(783,6)Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own(91,9)relations’ behaviour to the
remarks(898,7) two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,

all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.

CHAPTER X.(32,19)The day passed(671,6)as t(23,7)before had done. Mrs. Hurs(427,6)Miss

“I(232,6)already told her so once, by(75,6)desire(52,7)am afraid you do not like(119,6)pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend

think at least highly interesting. The power of doing any(480,6)with

panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very

foolish things(406,6)were said in the(437,8). A(284,6), upon my honour, I
believed(312,6)I(64,6)of myself(396,7)tru(248,7)I (49,7) it a(541,6)

“I daresay you(159,8)d it; but I am by no means convinced(716,6)you

dependent on chance a(407,7)of any man I know(684,6)if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend(476,6)to say, ‘(567,9)you had better stay
till next week,’(99,6)ould probably do it--(26,19)not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month.”

“You have only proved by this(748,9)Elizabeth, “that Mr.(769,8) did
not do justice to his own disposition. (109,9)shown him off now much

intend; for he(668,7)certainly think the(548,8)of me if, under(745,6)a
circumstance, I(625,9)give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.”

“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rash(286,8)your original intention
as atoned for (401,8)obstinacy in adhering to it?”

“Upon my(692,7)I cannot exactly explai(420,6)matter--(165,6)must speak for

but(469,7)I(816,6)never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
stand accord(247,7)your representation, you(208,6)remember, Miss Bennet,
that the (716,7)who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely(70,7)d it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.”

“To yield readily--easily--(160,7)_persuasion_ of a(229,8)is(825,6)rit

circumstance occurs, before we discuss th(12,6)retion(670,8)behaviour

myself, I(632,8)(993,6)y him half so much deference. I declare I do not

when he has noth(772,7)do.”

Mr.(306,7)smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive(899,6)he was

resented the indignity(188,6)d received, in an expostulati(448,7) her

“I see your design,(769,8),” said his friend. “You dislike an(681,10)

“Perhaps I do. A(734,7)s are to(585,7)like disputes. If you and Miss

thankful;(405,8)(846,10)say whatev(89,6)(142,6)of me.”

Mrs. Hurst sang(820,9) sister(545,6)while they were thus employed,
(177,10)could not help observing, as she turned over(328,11)-books
that lay on(1007,7)str(854,6) how frequently (535,9)’s eyes(152,6)fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose(542,6)she(181,7)be an object of
admiration to so great a man(636,6)ye(433,7)he sh(427,6)ook at her because

him too little to care for his approbation.

After playing(904,6)Italian songs,(973,14)varied the charm by a
lively Scotch ai(740,7)soon(919,6)wards(610,10), drawing near(749,10), said to her,--

“Do you not feel a(565,7)inclination(163,8)ennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?”

She smiled, but made no answer. He rep(999,6)the ques(121,6)with some
surprise(683,8)silence.

“Oh,”(217,6)she, “I heard you before; but I(1004,11)immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know(264,6)ay ‘Yes,’

“Ha(448,6) anything else(693,7)pose for my domestic felicity?”

“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of(538,6)uncle and aunt Philips be(505,6)d

“It would not be easy, indeed(741,6)atch their expr(226,6); b(304,6)ir

At(736,6)moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
(330,9) herself.

“I di(226,6)know(834,6)you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
confu(479,6)les(157,7)had been overheard.

“You used us abominably ill,” answered(187,11), “running away without
telling us(181,10)were coming out.”

Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left(629,10)(255,8)

and immediately said,--

“This(444,6)is not wide enough for our party. We(351,7)tter go into the

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to(853,7) leaving her room for a couple of hour(727,7)evening.

CHAPTER XI.(98,16)]

Whe(273,6)ladies removed after dinner(814,11)ran up to her sister, and
see(243,8)well guarded from cold, attended her(720,9) drawing-room,
(616,6)sh(368,6)welcomed (926,6) two friends(707,6)many professions of
pleasure; and(1002,11)had never se(245,6)m so agreeable as they were

with accuracy, relate an anecdote(981,6)humou(404,6) laugh at their

But w(523,8)(211,10)entered,(770,10)no longer(652,8)st object;
Miss Bingley’s eyes(238,6)instantly turned towards Darcy(172,6)she had
something to say to him(371,8)(38,6) advanced(513,6)steps. He addressed
himself directly to (161,6)ennet(575,6)a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst
also made her a slight bow(184,7)aid (687,7)“very glad;” but diffuseness
and warmth remained for(305,11)salutation. H(769,6)full of joy and
atten(34,6)T(384,9)half(677,7)as spent in piling up(427,8)e, lest she
should suffer(933,6)the change of room(834,6)she removed, at his desire,

(1000,9), at work i(719,6)oppos(485,6)rner, saw it all(819,6)great
delight.

When tea was over(527,10) reminded his sister-in-law(250,7)
card-table--but in vain. S(700,7)obt(510,6)private intelligence(302,6)Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards(991,6)(150,10)soon found even his open
petition rejected(135,6)assured him(415,6)no on(138,6)nded to pla(923,7)the
silenc(479,9)whole party o(359,6)subject seem(66,6)justify her. Mr.
(323,6)had, therefore, no(1008,9)do but to stretch (967,8)on on(606,8)
sofas and go to sleep. (307,6)took up a book.(1014,7)(870,6) did(174,6)ame;
(326,6)s(1004,7), principally occupied in playing(559,6)her bracelets and
rings, joined now(311,8)n in(48,7)other’s conversation(639,6)Miss
Bennet.

(174,12)’s (1009,9) was quite as much engag(161,6)watching(570,10)’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own(1009,10)was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
coul(706,8)n him, however,(963,7)(274,13); he merely answered her
question and read on. At length,(283,7)exhausted by the attempt to be
amused(455,10)own(271,7)which s(931,8)nly chosen because it was(781,6)econd volume of his, she gave a great yaw(176,6)said, “How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all(830,7) is no
enjoyment like(466,8)! How(551,6)sooner one tires of any(885,7)han of a
book! When I h(200,6)house of my own, I shall be miserable if(50,8)not
an excell(147,6)brary.”

No one made any reply. She(810,6)yawned again, threw aside(881,6)(693,6)nd
cast her eyes rou(875,6) room in quest of(677,6)amusement; when, hearing
(918,11) m(867,6)ing a ball to (905,6)ennet(476,6)turned suddenly
towards him(486,10)--

“B(636,6)bye Charles, are you really serious in meditat(126,6)dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, befo(84,7)determine on it, to consult
the wish(504,6)the present party; I am(553,6)mistaken if(610,7)ar(468,6)(331,7)ong us to whom(300,8)(155,6)be rather a punishment(608,6)a
pleasure.”

“If you mean Darcy,” cri(1002,6)(405,8), “he may go(958,6)d, if he
chooses(259,9)it begins; but as for(386,6)all, it is quite a settled
thing, and as soon as Nicholls has(684,6)white soup enough(773,9)send
(641,6)my cards(224,6) should(913,6)balls infinitely better,” she replied, “(373,6)y were

ted(613,8)the usual process of such a meeting. It(616,7)sur(170,6) much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing(997,6)the order(633,7)

“Much (84,13), my dear Caroline, I dare say(471,6)i(157,8)not be
near so(699,6)like(956,7).”

(956,6)ingley(454,6)no answer(498,6)(495,6)fter(964,6)got up and walked abou(830,6)room. Her figure was elegant(78,7)he(55,8)well(647,6)(730,6) at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In(309,6)espe(380,6) of her feelings,(578,7)solv(556,6)one effort more; and,
turning to Elizabeth, said,--

“Miss(26,6) Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example(832,6)take a
turn(312,6) (312,10)I assur(67,6)(906,6)very refreshing(392,6) sitting so

(190,9)(316,6)urprised,(1015,6)greed to it immediately. (526,12)
succeeded no les(798,9)real object(361,8)civility: Mr.(465,6) looked
up. H(523,6)as(644,6)awake to the novelty of atten(810,7) that quarter as(211,11)herself could b(347,7)unconsciously closed his book(131,8)

he(128,7)imagine but two motives for(85,7)choos(599,7)walk(832,8)down(824,9) together, with either of which(87,9)his joi(679,6)hem(1003,6)
interfere. What(284,7)he mean? Sh(909,6)dy(735,7)know w(42,10)be his
meaning--and asked(777,10) whether s(252,9)at all understand him.

“Not(29,7),” was her answer; “but, depend upon it,(172,8)s to be
severe on us(828,6)our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
not(824,6)bout it.”

(740,12), however, was incapable(93,18)(727,10)in
anything(980,6)per(173,6)d, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his
(559,11).

“I have not the smallest(875,7)ion to(71,6)(511,10),” said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. “You(605,8)choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other’s confidenc(909,7)have secret
affairs to discuss, or(83,17)(958,9)(1018,6)your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I sh(738,7)
completely in(98,6)way; and(54,8)second, I can admir(246,6)much better
as I sit by(107,8)e.”

“Oh, shocking!” cried (625,12). “I never heard (587,8) so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”(879,6)(69,7) easy, if you(592,6)bu(592,6)incli(641,6)(566,8)(988,9). “We
can all plague(733,6)(123,6)one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate

yet taught me _that_(179,8)calmness of temper(961,6)resence of mind! No,
no; I feel he may defy us(997,6). And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves(406,9)please, by attempting(72,9) without a subject. Mr.

CHAPTER XIII(34,19)“I hope, my dear,” said Mr(1019,8) to his wife, as(727,12)t
breakfast the next morning, “that you(983,6)ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I(45,6)reason to expect an additi(22,6)our(910,8)party.”

“Who do you mean(213,9)? I know of nobody(348,6)is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in(798,6)(327,6) _my_(218,7)s

“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”

Mrs(459,8)’s eyes sparkled. “A(60,25)! It is Mr.
Bingley(295,11). Why, Jane--you never dropped a word(817,6)is(34,6)sly
thing! Well(372,11) I shall be extremely glad to see(655,6)(133,6).
But--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish(817,7)got

moment.”

(316,6)saw in the whole course of my life.”

This rous(842,6)eneral astonishment(657,6)he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by(998,9) and five daughters at once.

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus
explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter,(727,6)(46,6)
fortnight(50,7)answered it; for I thought it a ca(325,6)some delicacy,
and requiring early attention.(765,7)from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,
when(791,6)dead, may turn you all out(776,8) house as soon as he
pleases.”

“Oh, my dear,” cried(406,9), “I cannot bear to hear that m(184,6)ed.
Pray do not talk(902,6)at odious man. I do think (660,6)the hardest thing

children(661,6)(1010,9), if I had been you, I(84,8)have tried long ago
to do something or other(535,7)it.”

Jan(702,6)Elizabeth attempted to (638,7)(315,6)r the nat(795,7)an(202,7).
They had often(68,11)it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.

“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. (261,6); “and
no(446,6)can clear(850,12)(878,6)the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will liste(470,6)is letter, you may, perhaps, be a little

him to write to you at all, and(52,6)hypocritical. I hate such false

“Why, indeed, he does seem to(919,6)had some filial scruples on that
head, as(415,10)hear.”

Elizabeth was chiefly struck(783,6)his extraordinary deference for Lady
(1003,9), and his kind intention of christening, marrying(49,6)burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.

“He must be an oddity, I(268,6)(349,8)she. “I cannot(464,6)him out. There

the history of his acquaintance(1013,6)Mr. Darcy. She dare(720,6)even
m(313,7)that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved.(309,13)bega(480,6)subject himself. He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and,(506,7)(813,6)ing her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long(265,10) had been staying(834,6).

“About a month,” said(894,10); and then, un(473,11)le(956,6)(237,7)
drop, added, “he is a man of(534,6)large property in Derbyshire, I
understand.”

“Yes,” replied(667,8); “his estate(676,6)(105,6)noble one. A clear ten
thousand per annum. You(610,12)ave met(570,6)a person more capable of
g(387,6)you certain information (591,8)head than myself--for I(948,6)been
connected(683,6)his family, in a(961,11)(462,7),(539,6)my infancy.”

(894,9)(812,11)but look surprised.

“You may well be(29,10), Miss Bennet, at such an assertion(643,7)
seeing, as you probably might, the(1016,6)cold(644,8)of our meeting
yesterday. Are you much(957,9)(272,8)(955,9)?”

“As(38,7)s I ever wish to be,” crie(684,11), warmly. “(370,7)spent
four days i(929,7)ame house(389,8)m, and I think him very
disagreeable.”

(89,8)no right to give _my_ opinion(837,8)(692,7), “as to his being
(84,9) or otherwise. I am not qualified to form(731,6)(585,7)known him
too(1002,6)and too(487,6)to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial. But I believe your(218,8) of him would in general
astonish--and, perhaps, you(45,7)not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. He(551,7)are in(135,7)wn(814,7).”

“Upon my word I say no(955,6)_here_(907,6)I(681,6) say in any(509,7)(527,6)
neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgus(1004,13)pride. You will not find
him(186,6)favourably spoken of by anyon(645,8)cannot pretend(497,7)sorry(637,17)after a short
interrup(991,6)“that he or that any man sh(437,9)be estimated beyond
their deserts; but(958,6)_him_(572,11)it doe(313,6)often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frighten(46,9)
high and(732,6)ing manners(979,6)sees him only as he chooses(311,8)een(988,7)(247,7)take him, even on(991,6)slight acquaintance,(876,8)n
ill-tempered man.”

(389,7)(124,6)shook his head.

“I wonder(436,8)he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is
likely(1015,7)in this country much longer(573,7)do(714,12)know(451,6)I _heard_ nothing(1007,6)s going away when I
was a(804,15)I hope(937,6)plans in(718,7) of the ----shire will

“Oh no--it(915,8)for _me_(775,7)driven(175,6)by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
wish(511,6)avoid seeing(68,6)he must go. We are(702,6)n friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet(581,6)(348,6)have no reason for
avoiding(824,7)but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of
very great ill-usage(764,6)most painful regrets at(357,11)w(1024,7)is.
His father, Miss Bennet, the late(331,10), was one(473,8)best men
that ever breathed(903,6)the truest(328,7) I(39,6)had; and I can n(60,6)e
in company with(724,6)(460,9) without(556,7)grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous(803,8)verily believe I could forgive him any(831,6)and
ever(15,6), rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgrac(25,7)
memory(913,8)(423,6).”

Elizabeth fou(360,7)interest(886,8)subject increas(541,7)listened with
all her heart(236,6)the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.

Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
(1001,13)(629,6)society, appearing highly pleas(188,7)(795,7)at he
had yet seen(773,6)speaking(683,8)latter, especially,(610,6)gentle but(851,6)intelligible gallantry.

“It was the prospect of constant(184,11)nd good(202,9)” he added,
“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps(865,6)my(891,8)Denny tempted me

attention(705,6)excellent acquaintance(500,8) had procured them.
S(495,8)I own, is necessary to me. I have been a(833,11)ed ma(498,6)
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_(78,6)employment(562,6)(631,6).
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it e(593,7). The church _ought_ to(222,11)my profession--I
was brought up fo(539,6)(68,6)(483,6)I should at this time(306,11)in
poss(84,6) of a most valuable living, had it(871,9)the(799,7)man we
were(858,13)just now.”

“Indeed!”

“Yes--(887,7)e Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next(617,8)at(160,7)the best
(153,6) in his gift. He(829,8)godfather(1011,6)excessively attached(577,7)
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He mea(901,6)provide for me amply,
(768,6)(397,6)he had done it; but when th(338,8) fell, it was given
elsewhere.”

“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? H(21,9)his
will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”

“Ther(340,6)just such an informality i(214,6)terms(417,10)quest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour(202,7)not(980,6)doubt(621,6)

conditional recommenda(88,6)and to assert t(980,6)had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprude(12,6)n short, anything or nothing.

was of an ag(698,6)old it(209,7)h(261,6)(614,9) to another man; and no

different sort of me(560,8)ha(1007,7)tes m(954,6)This is quite shocking! He(276,8)s to be publicly disgraced.”

“Some time or (427,6)he _will_ be--but it sh(208,7) be by _me_. Till I
can forget his father,(267,7)never defy or expose _him_.”

Elizabeth(921,7)ed him for such feelings(611,8)ought him handsomer than
ever as he express(975,6)m.

“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can(563,6)been his motive? what can
have induc(168,7)to be(568,7) cruelly?”

“A thorough, determined dislike(473,6)--a(17,9)which(769,10)but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had(974,6)ate Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his son might(231,7)orne with me better; bu(453,12)’s uncommon
attachment to me irritat(435,6), I believe, very early in life. He had
not a(901,7)(667,6)ar the(753,9)competition in(281,7)we stood--(43,8)
of preferenc(320,8)was often given(806,8)I had not(577,9)(296,10)so bad as this--(611,6) I(523,6)(701,6)liked

descending to(808,6)malicious revenge,(832,6)injustic(16,10)humanity as
this!”

A(779,7)few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_
remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments,(337,6)s having an unforgiving(581,7). His disposition
must be dreadful(516,7)will(517,6)rust myself on(638,6)ubject,” replied Wickham; “_I_(1022,7)rdly be just to him.”

Elizabet(641,6)again deep in(626,8), and a(360,7)time exclaimed, “To
treat in(464,6)a manne(795,6)godson, the friend(12,7)avourite(296,7)
(949,6)!” She could(1003,6)added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But(538,9)ented herself
with--“And one(117,7)who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said,(376,6)e closest
(331,6).”

“We were born(39,8)same parish, with(24,15)k;(390,6)reatest
part of our you(503,7)pass(154,11): inmates(749,8)same house,
sharing(126,10)amuse(756,8)bject(56,14)parental care. _My_(493,7) began life(247,8)profession which(436,6)uncle, Mr. Philips,
appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use
to the late Mr. Darcy(755,6)devoted all his(763,6)(48,7)care(287,7)
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by(106,13) most
intimate, confidential(820,7).(155,10) often acknowledged himself to
be und(893,8)(503,7) obligations to my (879,6)’s active superintendence;
and when, immediately before(65,13)death(413,6)(161,6)gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it
(432,6)as(483,6)a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection(237,6)self.”

“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wo(333,7)at the very
prid(509,7)is(410,11)has not mad(257,6)just to you. If from no better
motive,(240,9)should not have been too proud(695,7)dishonest,--for
(16,9)y I must call it.”

“It _is_(200,7)ful,” replied Wickham; “for almost(748,9)ac(558,6)may be
traced to pride; and(11,6) has(660,7)been his best(698,9)It has
connect(686,6) nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none
of us consistent(140,6)i(122,8)haviour to me there were stronger
impulses even(119,6)pride.”

“Can such(520,11)(232,7)as his(410,6)ever don(744,6)good?”

“Yes; it(275,11)l(240,7)(707,6)liberal and generous; to give his money
freely, to display hospitalit(24,6)assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. Family(440,6)(36,6)_filial_(20,8)for he is ve(939,6)ud of what his

degenerate(776,6)the popular qualities, or lose the influenc(877,7)e
Pemberley House, is a powerful (849,6). H(662,6)also _brotherly(240,8)
which,(637,6)_some_ (37,9) affection, makes him a(282,6)kind and
careful guardian of his sister(798,6)you will hear(552,6)enerally cried up
as the (891,6)ttentive and(836,6)of(154,8)s.”

“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”

He shook(687,6)ead. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
speak ill(110,6)Darcy; but s(559,6)too much like her(328,8),--very, very
proud. As a child, she was(366,10)at(247,6)pleasing(718,6)extremely fond
of me(1008,6)I(649,7)evoted hours an(10,8)to(223,7)usement. B(183,9)

and, I understand, highly accomplished. Sinc(284,6)(838,6)’s death her
hom(683,6)been London, where a lady lives(684,6)her(997,6)superintends her
education.”

After many pause(280,6)many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth(546,7)not
help reverting once more to the first(146,7)aying,--

“I am astonished at his intimacy(888,6)Mr. Bingley. How can(21,12),
who seems good-humour itself(542,6)is, I really believe, truly(729,8),
be in friendship(1015,6)such a man?(126,9)they suit each(290,6)? Do you
know(181,12)?”

“Not at all.”

“H(580,7)sweet-tempered,(140,9) charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy i(1010,6)Probably not(892,6)Mr.(1004,6) can(816,6)e(563,7)he chooses. He does not
want abiliti(28,7)can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. Among those who are(267,7) his equals in consequence, (870,7)
very different man from(260,6)(907,6)(612,7)less prosperous. His pride
never deserts him(288,6)with the rich(114,7)liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honour(430,6)and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure.”

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the(950,7)t(160,9) Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
(999,10)(62,6)s. Philips. The usual inquiries as to(85,6)uccess were
made by(418,6)atter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when(139,13) began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her,(987,6)much earnest gravity, that it was not of(607,7)ast importance;
t(643,7)considered the money as a mere trif(389,8)begged she would not
make herself uneasy.

“I(1005,6)very well, madam,” said he, “tha(278,7)persons sit down to a
card(517,6) they must take their chance(227,7)s(967,6)gs,--and happily I
am not in such circumstanc(505,9)make five shillings any object. There
are, undoubtedly, many who c(272,8) sa(559,6)same; but, thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyon(404,6)necessity of regarding
little matters.”

Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and(918,6) observing(862,13)for
a few moments(639,7)ked (854,10)in a low voice whether her relations
were(799,6)intimately acquainted(711,6)the family of D(274,8).

“Lady (302,20)” she replied, “has(903,6)l(100,6)given him a
living. I hardly(664,6)how(246,13)was first introduced to her
notice, bu(817,6)ertainly h(868,7)known her long.”

“You(769,6)of course(922,6)(211,24) and(29,6)Anne Darcy(320,6)sisters; consequently(999,6)she is aunt to the present Mr.(69,6).”

“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of(166,15)’s
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterda(143,6)Her daughter, Miss(778,12)will have a(469,8)rge fortune, and it is
believed(270,10)and her cousin(75,6)unite the two estates.”

This information made(740,11)smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain(355,7) must be all her(904,10)s, vain and useless her
aff(349,6) for his(501,7)(207,9)praise of himself, if he were already
self-destin(701,6)another.

“(994,11),” said she, “speaks highly both(513,18)(343,8)
(437,8); but, from some particulars(744,6)he has relate(549,8)
Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; an(476,6), in spite of
her being his patroness,(784,9)n arrogant, conceited woman.”

“I (570,7) her to be(250,6)in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have
not see(1017,6)for many years; but I(703,6)well remember(953,6)(834,8)liked
her(726,6)(314,7)r manners(479,6)dictatorial(764,6)nsolent. S(358,7)the

her authoritative(213,7)(234,8)e res(44,6) the prid(738,6)er nephew, who
choose(599,7)everyone connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class.”

(1004,10)allowe(387,9) had given a(454,6)rational account of it, and
they continued talking together(163,6)mutual satisfa(1007,6)till supper put
an end to cards(534,6)gave(305,10)of the ladies their share of Mr.

CHAPTER XVII.(86,16)]

(782,10)rela(88,7)Jane,(968,6)ext day,(722,7)ad passed between Mr.
(766,7) and herself. Jane listened(866,6)astonishmen(571,6)concern: she
knew not how to believe(506,6)Mr. Darcy(350,7)be so unworth(578,8)
Bingley’s(530,7)(647,6)yet it(866,9)in her natu(444,6)question the
verac(661,7)a young man of such amiable appearance as(1024,8). The
possib(731,9)his having really endured(81,6)unkindness was enough to
interest all her tender feelings(868,6)noth(849,7)r(614,6)remain(546,6)be
done but to think(666,6)(979,6)m both, to defe(974,6) conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever(781,7)not be
otherwise explained.

“They have(142,6)” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or(93,6), of which we can form no idea. I(341,7)ed people(120,6)perhaps
misrepresented each(312,6)e other. It is(124,6)hort, im(496,6)le for us to
conjec(609,6)he causes or circumstances(169,7)ma(254,7)alien(901,6)hem,
without actual blame on either side.”

“Very true, indee(760,7)now, my dear(980,7)(966,7)ve you got to say in
behalf(537,7) (638,8)(297,10)who(301,7)robably been(964,8)ed i(834,6)business? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be oblig(686,6)(671,6)ill of
somebody.”

“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. M(272,6)est Lizzy, do but consider in(295,6)a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy,(872,6) treating his father’s favourite in(1008,6)a
manner,--one whom(51,11) had promis(962,6)provide fo(637,8)
(626,10). No man of common humanity, n(27,6)(439,6)d any valu(679,6)his
character,(934,7)be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively(937,9) in him? Oh no.”

“I can(448,6)more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being(859,6)ed on than that
Mr. Wickham should invent(351,7) history of himself as he gave me last
night; names, facts, everything mentioned (902,8)ceremony. If it be not
so, let(529,10) contradict it. Besides, there was truth(292,6)s looks(291,6)t is difficult(974,8)--i(25,7)stressing. One does not know(988,6)to
think(371,7)beg your pardon;(628,6)knows exactly(56,8)(894,6).”

But Jane(534,7)(918,6)with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.
(456,7), if he _had been_(466,11), would have(982,6)to suffer when
the affair became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they (223,8) speaking;(718,12) and his sisters came to give their

(162,9) felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by Wickham(243,7)ose(749,6)(240,6)(861,6)to have Mr. Collins
instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. Ther(936,6)no help

This par(978,9)intelligence,(452,8)unheard by(351,6), was caught by
Elizabeth; and, as it assur(899,6)(748,6)Darcy(751,9)less answerable for

distress: they were(57,7) of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and
solemn, apologizing instead of attending(680,6)often moving wrong
without being awar(693,6)t, gave her all the shame and misery(941,7)a

were over(640,6)(476,6)ed(707,21)and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his appl(593,7) for her hand, that, (522,7)
knowing what she did(865,6)accepted him. He walked away again
immediately(837,6)(921,8)left to fret ove(128,6)own wa(513,6)presence of

“I dare say you will find him very (664,9).”

“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
a man(91,10) whom one is determi(520,7)hate! Do not wish me such an
evil.”

(602,7)(1024,6)ing recommenced, howev(734,8)Darcy approach(276,7)laim her
(463,6)(636,10)could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a

reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal(145,6)ment(108,6)hol(60,6)t.
They stood for some time(901,8) speaking a word;(844,9)began to
imagine th(242,6)ir silenc(880,6)to last through the two dances, and, at
first, was resolve(561,6)to break it; till suddenly(516,6)ing(123,6)it

silent. After a pause of(359,6)minutes, she addressed him a second time,
with--

“It is _your_ turn to say something now,(557,10). _I_ talked about the
dance(968,6)_you_ ought(834,9)some kind of remark(244,8)size of the
room, or the number of couples.”

He smil(282,8)assured her(558,6)whatever she wish(256,7)(214,8)h(464,7)
said.

“Very well;(623,6)reply will do f(140,7)present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I

“Do you talk by rule, then, while you ar(581,6)ing?”

“Sometimes. One mus(896,7) a little, you know. It (752,6)look odd to be

“Ar(282,6)consulting your own feelings i(895,6)(486,7) case, or do you

“Both,”(957,8) Elizabeth archly; “for I(202,6)always seen a great
similarity(148,8)turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to(512,6), unless we expect(1017,7)

posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”

“This is no very striking resemblance of(438,10)character, I am sure,”
said he. “How near it(840,8)to _mine_, I cannot pretend(248,7). _You_
think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”

“I(851,6)not decide on my own performance.”

He made no answ(813,8)they were again(867,8)ti(312,6)y had gone down

the tempta(617,6)added, “When you met us ther(577,6)other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaint(321,8)The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he sa(286,7)a word(405,6)(953,9), though blaming herself
for he(657,6)weakness, coul(364,6)go on. At length Darcy spoke(826,6)in a
constrained manner said,--

“Mr. Wickham is blessed(855,6)such happy(56,7)s as may insure his
_making_ friends; whether he(794,8)equally capabl(317,6)retaining_ them,
is less certain.”

“He has been so unlucky as to lose(946,6)(123,7)hip,” replie(352,12)
with emphasis, “(283,8)(271,8)which he is likely to suffer from all
his life.”

(362,6)(876,14)(371,6)seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to(297,6) meaning to pass
through(94,6)et(41,7)(773,7)si(685,6)the room; but, on perceiving Mr.(210,6), he stopped,(517,6)a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.

“I have(467,6)most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir;(653,6)very

first circles. Allow me to say, however,(64,9)r fair(206,8) does not
disgrace you: and(114,6)I must hope to(248,6)this pleasure(179,7)repeated,
especially when a(782,8)(592,6)able event(285,10)Miss(748,6) (gl(376,6)

then flow in! I(659,6)l to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.
You will not thank me for detaining you(877,6)the bewitching converse of(818,6)young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”

The latte(554,6)(894,6)is address was scarcely heard by(333,7) but Sir
William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly,(890,8)
eyes were direct(984,11)(249,6)erious expression, towards(564,8) and
Jane, who(77,7)(993,7)together. Recovering himself(833,11)shortly,
he turn(185,6)his(844,8)(177,6)said,--

“Sir (259,10)(594,9)ion has made(577,7)get what we(232,6)talking

“I do(630,7)ink(38,9)speaking at all. (114,11) could not have
(721,9)ed any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,
and(235,9)are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”

“Wha(252,8)you of books?” said he, smiling.

“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not(595,6)(22,8)

“Yes,(132,7),” she repli(964,8)out knowing(771,6)she said; for her

by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing(619,6)nce say, Mr. Darcy,

to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it ou(289,6)And(718,6)is(522,6)success?”

She shook h(621,6)d. “I do not get on at all. I hear(893,6)different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly(429,6) can readily believe,” answere(558,6)gravely, “that reports may vary

not to sketch my(392,10) (467,6) p(822,6) mo(825,6)as there is reason to
fear(91,6)the performance would reflect no credit on either.”

“But if (376,9)take(949,6)likeness now, I may(820,7)have another

silence; on each side dissatisfied, though(250,6)o an equal degree; for
in Darcy’s breast(391,7)was a tolerably powerful feel(784,6)wards her,
which soon procu(625,6)r pardon(222,6)directed all his anger against
(370,7).

They had not long separated when(633,7)ingley came(141,13) and,
with an expression of civil disdain, thus accost(177,6),--

“Hi(85,7) and his (64,7) appear, by(135,6)account, to be(997,6)ame,”
said(200,6)beth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing
worse than of being(100,6)on of(944,13)stewar(377,6) of _that_, I can
assure(354,6)he informed me(518,8).”

“I beg(353,6)pardon,” replied(409,6)Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant(118,6)(579,8)girl!” (315,14) to herself. “You are(435,6)mis(714,6)if

such sweet complacency, a glow of(277,6)happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied(512,6)the occurrences of the evening.
(465,10)instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude
for Wickham, resentment against his enemies(780,6)every(474,6)else, gave
way befor(949,6)hope of Jane’s(874,7)i(383,6)fairest way for happiness.

“I want to know,(701,7)she,(790,8)countenance no less smil(972,6)an her

“No,” replied Jane, “I(179,6)not forgotten him; but (30,10)hing

Elizabeth tried hard to dissuad(163,6)from such a scheme; assuring him
that(301,10)(691,6) consider his address(49,7) without(375,9)tion as

reception of his advances she eagerly watched,(105,6)hose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with

“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisf(367,9)my(873,10)(496,12)(275,6) much pleas(416,8)the atten(50,6)He answered

As(439,10) had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she (512,6)

even to like(321,8)’s two(350,7)s. Her mother’s(537,8)s she plainly

lest she might hear too much. When they sat d(573,7)supper, therefore,

(859,7)to find (638,8)in staying at home at any period(1020,8)life. She
concluded with many good wishes(654,6)Lady Lucas(331,6) soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently(817,6)riumphantly believ(1004,7)r(230,6)no
chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity(224,8)mother’s
words, or persuade(623,6)o describ(16,6)felicity in a(371,6)audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexatio(565,6)(906,6)perceive(973,9)

sure we owe him no such particular civility as(958,7)(870,11)say
nothing _he_ may not like(339,6)ar.”

“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you
to offend(345,10)? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing.”

N(193,7)that(489,11)say, however, had any influence. H(654,9) would
talk(903,8)views in the same intelligible tone.(765,11)blushed and

At length(504,11)Mrs. Bennet had no more(765,7); and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawn(279,7)the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.

had the mortifica(259,8)seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,

and, when(958,6)had finis(781,8)second song, said aloud,--

“That will do extremely well, child. You have(984,8)ed us long enough.
Le(754,6)other young ladies(58,6)time to exhibit.”

(828,6)though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted(1016,6)(622,9), sorry for (446,9)(19,13)(388,7)’s speech(92,6)afraid

“If I,”(358,6)Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be abl(780,6)ing, I

room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.
Bennet(783,8), whil(743,6)wife seriously comm(956,6)Mr. Collins for

Before(289,10) had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.

you can, bring her to(441,10) and I(814,6)visit her.’ Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin(904,9)do not reckon the not(778,8)kindness of Lady Catherine d(504,8) as among the least(819,7)
advantages in my pow(208,6)offer. You(1017,6)find her manners beyond

which her rank(389,6)inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assur(870,6)there are many amiable young women. But the fact is(572,6)
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of(913,6)honoured
father (who, however, may liv(151,7)years longer), I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from(691,7)his daughter(216,8)the loss to them might be as little as possible(577,7)he melancholy
event takes place--which(225,11)as I have already said(249,6)not be
for several(258,6). This has been my moti(991,20)and I
flatter (285,7)it(879,6)not sink me in(841,6)esteem. And now nothing
(656,8)for me but to (578,11)i(254,7)ost animated language of the
vio(848,6)(668,6)affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand(97,6)at nature o(207,7)(598,6), sinc(90,7)well
aware(50,6)it(583,11)be complied with; and(90,6)one thousand pounds
(245,7)4 per cents., which(354,10)be yours till(776,7)your mother’s
decease, is all(201,6)you may ever be entitled to. On(238,6)head,
therefore, I (286,6)be uniformly silent: and(87,9)(1020,10)rsel(317,6)
no ungenerous reproach(83,7)ever pass my lips(755,6)we are married.”

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget(492,6)(825,7)made no
answer. Let me do(745,6)thout further(979,6)of time. Accept my thanks for
th(517,8)men(393,6)are paying me.(674,6)very sen(1023,6)(737,6) honour of
your proposals, but it is impos(54,6)(846,7)to do otherwise than decline
them.”

“I am not now to learn,” re(688,6)Mr. Collins, with a formal wav(900,9)hand, “(764,8)is usual(50,6)young ladies to reject the addresse(319,6)he

third(470,7)I am, (790,11)by no means discouraged by w(876,8)have
just said, and(844,7)hope(368,7)(832,6)to(273,6)ltar ere long.”

“Upon my word(706,8)cried Elizabeth, “your(86,6)is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do(960,11)(780,8)(541,6)
on(653,7)ose(463,14)(if suc(485,16)here are) who are so
daring a(517,6)isk(429,6) happiness on the chance of be(50,6)k(417,11)

(200,6)suaded she (89,6)find me in every respect ill qualified(757,8)

“Were it certain(773,6)(134,15)(192,6)think so,” sai(1010,14)
very gravely--“but I cannot imagine(864,6)her Ladyship(192,7)at all

seeing her again I(844,7)speak(415,8)highest terms(114,7)r modesty,
econom(506,7)o(806,6)miable(339,8)cations.”

“Indeed,(276,13) all praise of me will be unnecessary(633,6)must
give me leave to judge for myself(646,6)pay m(243,6)compliment of
believing w(916,6)say. I wish you very happy and(15,6)rich(734,6)by

In making(169,8)offer,(459,6)ust(437,6)satisfied the delicacy(394,8)
feelings with regard to my famil(917,7)may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter(637,7)
considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus
spoke,(954,11)have quitt(262,7)room, had not(866,12)(65,6)addressed her,--

“W(775,6)do(549,7)(780,14)(755,6)ing to you next o(770,6)subject, I
(800,6)hope to receive a more favourable answer than you(894,6)now given
me; though I am far from acc(602,9) of cruelty at present, because I
know it to b(989,6)established custom(946,9)sex(180,6)ject a man(225,7)
first appl(941,7), and, perhaps(657,6)have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as(445,7)be consistent(678,6)the tru(718,14)the
female character.”

“Really,(487,12),” cried Elizabeth(679,6) some warmth, “you puzzle me
exceedingly. If(1023,8)have hitherto(217,6)can appear(528,8)i(523,6)form
of (239,9)ment, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince(497,8)its being one.”

“You must give me leave to fl(889,7)yself, my dear cousin, that your
(131,8)of my (798,8)s are merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not(316,11)me(135,6)my hand
is unworthy(666,9)acceptance, or(183,6)(717,13)ment I can offer
(601,9)any oth(875,8)highly desirabl(198,6)situation in life, my
connections(660,10)family of De Bourgh, and(455,6)lationship(534,7)r
own, are circumstances(136,8)in my favour; and you should take it into
further(809,6)der(176,6)that, in spite(970,9)manifold attra(196,6), it is
by no means certai(71,6) an(296,6)offer of marriage may ever be made you.
Your por(313,6)s unhappily so small(609,7)it will in all likelihood undo
the effects(497,9)loveliness and amiable qualific(359,6). As I must,
therefore, conclud(600,7)you are not serious in(600,6)rej(482,6) of me, I
shall choose to attribute it(469,8) wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”

“I do assure you, sir(941,7)I have no pretens(671,6)hatever(103,6)at kind
(94,9)ce which(573,6)sts in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rath(505,6)paid the compliment of being (1020,6)ed sincere. I thank you
again(457,6)gain for the honour you(214,6)done me(415,9)proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossi(979,8)feelings in every(227,8)

(430,6) inten(480,8)plagu(433,7)but as a (936,6)al creature(111,6)ing the
truth from her heart.”

“Y(694,7)uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express
authority of both(922,6)excellent parents, my(426,10)(1002,6)not fail of
(545,6)(441,6)able.”

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth(660,6) make no
reply, and immediately(16,6)n silence withdrew; determined(845,7)if he
persisted in(503,9)ing her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in(273,6)a manner as must be decisive(234,6)(74,6)behaviour at least could
not be mistake(875,10)affectatio(905,6)coquetry of(728,11) (728,6).

CHAPTER XX.(33,19)Mr. Collins was not left lo(802,6)the(407,6)t contempl(146,6)of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch(254,9)end of the conference, no sooner saw(615,11)open the
door(374,6)ith quick step pass her towards(219,6)taircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room(697,6)congratulated(871,6)him and herself in
warm terms o(237,6)happy prospect(221,7)ir nearer connection. (407,11)
received and return(157,6)se felici(548,6)s(242,6)equal pleasur(641,7)then
proceeded to relate the particulars(148,10)interview,(328,6)the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
(921,7)(72,8)is cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty(245,8) genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled(721,12): she(143,7)have been
glad(242,7)equally(250,10) that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
(677,6)ul(26,6)help saying so.

“But depend upon it,(626,12),” she added, “that Lizzy shall be
brought(586,6)ason. I will speak to her(1004,8)t myself directly. She is
a very headstrong, foolish girl(880,6)does not know her own(674,6)est; but
(126,7)_make_ her(45,6)it.”

“Pardon me fo(732,7)rupting you, madam,” cried(893,12); “but if she
is reall(177,12) and(180,8), I(164,6)not whether(558,10)
altog(21,6)be (251,7)desirable wife to a man in my situ(661,7)who
(767,10)looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she
act(676,6)persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into acce(340,6)me, because, if liable to such defects of
temper, she(690,11)contribute much to my felicity.”

“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” sai(952,13), alarmed. “(718,6)is
on(461,14)in(163,6)matters as these. In everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived(799,9)go(773,9) to Mr(159,11)nd
we(868,7)very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”

S(609,8) not give him time(928,6)ply, but hurrying instan(132,7)her
husband, called out, as she entered the library,--

“Oh,(193,13)you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
You must come and make (418,6)marry(912,12), fo(851,6)vow(159,6)will
not ha(250,6); and if you do not(84,6)haste (51,7) change his mind and(71,10)_her_.”

(417,10) raised his eyes from his book(301,15), and fix(312,6)m
on her face(456,6)a calm unconcern, which was not(973,8)least al(387,6)by
her communication.

“I(253,6)not the pleasure of (791,10)ing you(795,8)he, when she had
finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”

“Of(412,12) and(440,6).(447,7)declare(424,10) (424,9)(468,12)
and(73,13)begins to say that(438,9)(489,9)(105,6)”

“And(163,7)m I to do o(318,6)occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”

“Speak to(634,7)about it yourself. Tell her(145,6)you insist up(478,6)
ma(864,7)him.”

“Let her be(857,8)down. Sh(1000,8)hear my opinion(627,6)s(628,11)ng the bell(597,6)Miss Elizabet(560,6)summoned to the

“Come here, child,” cri(485,7)father(1000,8)appeared. (592,8)sent for
you on an affair of importance. I(615,11)(432,6)(536,12)has made
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?”

(222,10)replie(84,7)it was.

“Very well--(114,6)is(86,18) you(974,6)refused?”(811,9), sir.”(75,12). We now come(330,7) point. Your mother(501,7)s(502,6)your
accepting it(203,8)not so, (461,11)?”

“Yes, or I(784,7)ever see her again(724,7) unhappy(1020,6)native is befo(907,6),(518,10). From(264,6)day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents(223,14)(151,15)you
again if you do _not_ marry(968,13) and(217,18)you(217,6)
(66,7)_do_.(486,13)could not but smile at such a conclusion of(21,8)beginning;
but(359,12), who had persuad(749,6)self(954,6)her husband regarded the
(732,7)(783,7)wished, was excessively disappointed.

“What do(372,6)ean, Mr(140,10)by talking in(681,6)way? You promised me
to _(602,6)_(602,6)her(355,6)ing him.”

“My dear,”(793,9)(205,11),(952,9)two small favours to request.
First,(935,6)you(649,6)allow me the free use of my(988,11)ing on the
present occasion; and, secondly,(60,7)room. I shall be glad to(169,7)he
library to myself as soon as may be.”

Not yet, however, in spite of her(409,11)ment i(324,6)(285,9)did
(910,11) give up(999,12)She talked to(862,10)(920,6) and(930,6);
coaxed and threaten(396,7)by turns(77,6)endeavour(82,6)secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and(175,10), sometimes(75,6)real earnest(70,6)and
(37,15)playful gaiety,(609,9)to her attacks. Though(671,7)nner
varied(409,11)her determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile(872,6)meditat(814,7)solitude on what(981,6)assed.
He thought too well of him(1002,6)o comprehend(65,9)motive his cousin
could refuse him(332,6)(90,6) his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary(100,8)e(481,7)ility(710,7)
deserving(355,6)other’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

Whil(969,7)amily were in t(249,6)nfusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day(655,6)them(801,6)(424,6)t(80,6)e vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cri(306,6)a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! What do you think has happened(233,6)morning? (626,11) has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”

who(416,9)tell the same news(695,6)no sooner had(77,6)(156,11)
(156,9)-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss(586,7)(766,8)compas(622,6)and entreating
h(380,6)persuade her friend(400,6)(963,8)l(642,10) wishes(811,8)(734,6). “Pray do, my dear(138,11),” she added,(639,6)melancholy tone;
“for nobody is on my side,(22,8)takes part(782,6)me; I am cruelly used,
(68,7)feel(259,6)my poor nerves.”(525,11)(980,6)ly was spar(494,6)the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

“Ay,(795,7)sh(815,6)s,” continued(468,12), “looking as unconcerned as
may be(762,6)caring no more for us(519,6)if we(664,6)at York, provided she

is always so. Thos(144,6)(544,7)(123,8) are(608,7)pitied.”

Her daughters listened in silence to(680,6)effusion, sensible(448,6)any
attempt to reason(541,6)or sooth(867,6)would only increase the irritation.
She talked on, therefore, without interrup(301,6)rom any of them till
they(1017,6)joined by Mr. Collins, who entered(710,6)an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said(293,6)e girls,--

“Now,(932,6)insist upon it(758,7)you, all of(12,6)hold(938,6)tongues, and
let(188,12) a(765,6)have a little convers(577,6)together.”

Elizabeth passed quietly out(308,7) room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of(424,17)se inquiries after
herself and all her famil(501,7)very minute(442,6)then by(304,9)
curiosity, satisfied (87,8)with w(1002,6)(472,8)window and pretending
not(248,8). In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected
(444,12):--

“Oh,(687,12)!”

“My dear madam,” repl(181,6), “let us be for ever(957,6)t on(956,6)point.
Far be it(825,6)me,” he presently continued, in a(200,7)that marked his
displeasure, “to (64,6) the behaviour(729,7)r daughter. Resign(678,8)

CHAPTER XXI.(34,19)The discu(407,6)of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer(489,6)the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally(564,6)some peevish allu(184,8)her mother.
As(391,9)gentleman him(441,6)_his_(130,10)were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrass(830,6)r de(746,7), or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of (490,6) and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to
her(562,6)the assiduous attentions which he had(713,6)so s(572,7) of

not appear(127,8)least affected by it. He(168,7)ways to have gone on

After breakfast,(785,6)irls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returne(1012,6) to la(786,6)ver his absence(1010,10)Netherfield ball.
He joined(530,6)on their entering the town(1022,6)attend(46,8)(584,6)ir

well t(265,6)over. To(511,10), however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of(272,13)_had_(917,7)elf-imposed.

She highly approved his forbearance;(459,8)y had leisure for a full

sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well co(153,6)with a lady’s
fair, flowing hand(741,6)Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as
she read(757,9)(56,8)dwelling intently on so(1020,7)(632,6) passages.
Jane recollected(552,8) soon(897,6)putt(708,8)(380,7)away, tried to
join,(485,6)her usual cheerfulness, in the general convers(556,7)but

than a glance(80,6)Jane invi(293,7) to follo(431,6)upstairs. When they
had g(578,6)(708,6)own room, Jane, taking out her(729,7), said, “This is(707,6)Caroline Bingley: what it(679,8)s has surprised me a good deal.
The whol(520,6)y have left(798,12) by this time(811,6)are(386,7)ir way
to tow(540,7)without any(625,7)ion of coming(1022,6)again. You shall hear
what she says.”

She then(728,6)the first sentence aloud,(513,7)com(234,7)the information
of(367,7)having just resolved(439,11)(404,6)brot(463,7)town directly,
and (76,9)meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.
Hurst had a house. The next was(792,7)se words:--“‘I do not pretend to
regret anything I(330,7)leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many
returns(286,6)at delightful intercourse we(614,6)known(590,6)(239,6)
meanwhile may less(820,6) pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To(373,6)
high-flown expressions Elizabeth listene(745,6) all(622,7)sensibility of
distrust(789,6)though the suddennes(301,7)eir removal(940,11)her, she
saw no(483,6)in it really to lament: i(569,6)not to be suppo(777,6)at(937,6)

to the lo(194,12)(595,9)she was persuad(132,8)Jane must soon
cease to regard it(759,7)(596,6)ment of his.

“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be
able to see(776,6)(756,6)s before they(831,7)the country. But may we not
hop(1005,7)th(783,8) of(800,8)happiness, to which Miss(342,8) looks

them.”

“Caroline decidedly says(656,6)none(764,7) part(90,7)return into

“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagin(796,11) business(429,6)

“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “(524,8)comes back no mo(910,7)
(910,7)”(80,9)only(85,9)that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”

“Why(982,6)you think so? It must be his own doing; he is(21,9)master.
But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read(103,7)e passage(1017,7)particularly hurts me. I(877,6)have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is

capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment(740,6)no(650,6)to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulg(481,7)(679,6)of an (67,6)which(553,6)secur(550,6)happiness
of so many?’ Wha(938,8)you of _this_ sentence(131,9) Lizzy?” said(141,7)as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Doe(26,9)expressly
declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be he(879,8);
that she is perfectly convinced(946,9)(725,6)’s indifference(572,6)that

“Yes,(51,7)can; for mine is totally (205,8)t. Will you hear i(68,6)Most willingly.”

“You sha(958,7) it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees(421,6)(329,11) is

Jane shook her head.

“Indeed, (865,6)you ought(615,6)lieve me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection;(334,13), I am sure, cannot: she
i(187,6)such a simpleton. Could she(430,6)seen half as much(388,6)in Mr.
Darcy(674,6)erself, she would(494,6)ordered her wedding clothes. But the

in achieving a second; in which(927,7)is certainly some ingenuity(647,6)I
dare say it(349,7)succeed if(830,6)de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my
dearest(642,11)(533,6) seriously imagine that, because(931,13)
tells(1019,7)(931,10)greatly admires(904,11), he is(886,8)smallest

of being in(741,6)with you(191,8)very(772,6)(34,13)her friend.”

“If we th(987,6)alike o(422,7)(918,8)” replied(393,7)“your
representation of all this might make me quite eas(474,6) I know the
found(64,6)is unjust. Carolin(389,7)capa(362,7)wilfully deceiving

“That is right. You could not(822,6)started a(956,6)happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine: believe h(489,6)be(141,9), by all means.
You(941,6)now done your duty by her(888,6)must fret no longer.”

“(845,7) dear sister, can I b(189,7), even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose(74,7)s and(592,7)s are all wishing(694,6)o marry
elsewhere?”

“You(178,6)decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find(853,6)the misery of disoblig(149,6)s two(193,9)is
more(954,6)equivalent to th(478,6)iness (882,9)his wife, I advise you,
(440,12), to refuse him.”

“How can you talk so?(235,7)(857,6)faintly smiling; “y(295,8)know(701,6),

“I di(744,6)think you would(864,6)that(259,7)the case,(876,6)not consider

required. A thous(163,6)ings may arise in six months.”

The idea of his(124,7)ing(126,9)(631,9) treated(195,6)the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s
interes(92,6)shes(353,6)she(411,6) not for a moment(924,7)e(733,8)ose

so totally independent of everyone.

She represent(236,10)(836,6), as forcibly as possible, what she felt on
(279,6)bject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane’s temper was not desponding(332,10)was gradually l(420,7)ope(836,9)the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the(64,6) that

to understand by it(73,9)(338,6)t of paying his addresses to one of

She rated(106,6)b(284,7)(999,6)hig(970,9)any(274,7)(587,6)s: there was a

her composure(749,6)calmly replied(308,6)Why should you be surprised,(313,9)Eliza? Do you think it incredible(626,6)(749,11)(84,8)be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,

“I see what you are feeling,”(484,8)(755,10); “you must(485,14)

But when you have had time to(565,10)all over, I hope you will be

was a long(576,6)before she became a(585,6)reconcil(180,10)idea of so
unsui(500,6)a match. The strangeness of(505,14) making two offers

(924,14)sitting with her mother(329,6)isters,(948,8)ing(951,8)(228,9)heard(376,6)doub(76,6)hether(582,6)as authoriz(936,6)mention it,
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announc(774,6)engagement(564,8)family. With many compliments(601,7)m,
and much self-gratulation o(470,6)prospect(640,6)connection between the
houses, he unfol(622,8)matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet,(427,6)more perseverance than
politeness, p(605,37); and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--

“Good Lord!(470,12), how can you tell such a story? Do not you know(905,6)Mr. Collins wa(432,7)marry Lizzy?”

Nothing less tha(900,6)complaisance(434,8)urtier could have borne
without anger(151,6)treatment: but(671,12)’s good-breeding carried
him through it all(343,6)though he begged leave to be positive a(651,8)
truth of his information, he listen(837,6)all their impertinence(966,6)the
most forbearing(257,6)esy.(1024,11), feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situ(160,7)now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it(120,6)Charlotte(95,8); and
endeavour(276,6)put(595,6)p(1023,8)excla(322,6)s of her mother and sisters,
by(47,6)arnestnes(46,9)congratul(69,7)to(729,14)in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happin(721,7)t migh(954,6)xpected(395,6)the match,(234,8)ellent character
of(836,12)(131,6)(799,6)nvenient dist(806,8)Hunsfor(96,7)London.

Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowe(392,7)say a great deal while
(840,11) remained; but no sooner had he left them(980,6)her(683,8)s
found a rapid vent. I(1016,6)first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of(332,8)ter; secondly(65,6)was very sure(400,6)(339,11)
had been taken in; thir(63,9)trusted(457,6)they would never be happy
together; and, fourthly,(56,9)(490,6)(523,10)broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduc(572,12)whole: one(103,6)
Elizabeth was the real cause of all(629,6)ischie(899,6) the other(70,7)sh(932,9) (286,9)barbarously us(790,6)them all(71,6)(763,6)se two
points(449,6)rincipally dwelt during(160,7)st(447,8)day. Nothing could
console and n(26,7)appease her. Nor di(414,7)day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she(107,6) see (320,11)ithout
scolding her: a month passed away(73,19)peak to (813,11)
or Lady Lucas(94,8) being rude(394,6)many(99,6)s(507,6)gone(171,11)

Mr(1006,8)’s emotion(81,7)much more tranquil(440,7) occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to b(603,6) most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover(922,6)Charlotte(298,6), whom he had
been(637,6)to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more(30,9)than his(320,9)!

Jane confessed(780,9)a little surprised (987,12): but s(220,7)
less of her astonishment(114,6)(25,7)earnest desire for(462,7)happiness;
nor(675,7)(991,10)persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and
Lydia(600,6)far from envying Miss(371,8)for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman(1011,6)it affected them in no other way(350,6)as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.

(803,11)(917,6)not be in(478,8) of triumph on(833,7)able to retort on
Mrs(771,8) the comfort of having a(817,9) well married(904,6)she
call(482,6)Longbourn rather often(690,6)n usual to say how happy she was,
though (146,11)’s sour looks(328,6)ll-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive(546,10) away.

mutually silent on the subject(503,6)(648,10)felt(653,9)d(963,6)no

Bingley had now been gone a week(90,6)nothing was heard of his return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer(262,7) letter(182,6)w(850,6)nting
the days till she(620,7)reasonably hope(334,6)ar(414,8)The promised

that it was merely(811,6)the view of enjoying her society(239,8) had
been so ready to close(73,9)ir kind wish of see(323,6)(972,7) at
Longbourn, whither he hop(511,6)be able to(737,7) on Monday fortnight;
for Lady Catherine, he added, s(675,6)tily approved his marriage, that
she wished it to take place as soon as possible,(607,7)he trusted would
be an un(874,6)able argument(694,6)his(435,9)Charlotte to nam(938,10)

(850,11)’s(297,8)into Hertfordshire was no longer a ma(928,7)
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. O(805,6)contrary, sh(72,6)as much dispo(941,6)
complain of it as her husband. I(623,6)very strange(591,9)should come
to (535,9) instead of to(721,6) Lodge;(703,8)also(85,6)inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated(866,8)visitors i(241,6)house
while(197,6)ealth was so indifferent(862,6)lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such(47,6)the gentle murmurs of(389,12)(960,9)y
gave way only to(61,6)reater distres(63,7). Bingley’s continued
absence.

Ne(878,6)Jane nor Elizabet(151,7)comfortable on this subject. Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of(715,7)an the
report(845,7)shortly prevailed in Meryton(58,6)s coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a (99,13)highly incensed Mrs.
(363,12)(138,8)e never f(137,6)to(775,7)dict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

Even(341,11)began to fear--not(764,6)(422,7) was(599,12)--bu(34,6)
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness(735,6)so
dishonourable(635,8)stability of her(776,6), she could not prevent its
frequently recurring. The united effort(550,7)s two unfeeling(263,8),
and(526,8)overpowering friend, assisted by the attraction(862,6)iss
Darcy(860,8) amusemen(123,6)London, might be too much(220,6)feared, for
(264,6)rength(674,8)attachment.

As fo(873,6), _her_ anxiety under(860,8)spense was, of course, more
painful(821,6)(938,9)’s: but whatever(156,7)lt she was desirous of
concealing; and between herself and(688,10), therefore,(491,6)(1020,6)
was(791,7)alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom pass(1002,6)(891,10)di(573,6)talk of(808,8), express her
impatience for(379,6)rrival, or even require Jane(964,7)fess(894,6)if he
(108,8)come back she should think(293,9)very ill-used. It needed all
(829,7)steady mildness to bear these(540,6)ks with tolerable
tranquillity.

Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. H(609,6)too happy, however, to need much attention;
and, luckily for the others(612,6)business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal(886,8)company. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometime(378,11)to(319,11)only in time
to make an apolog(219,6)his absence before the family went(535,6)d.

Mrs. Bennet was real(160,6)a(561,7)itiable state(286,6)very m(409,6) of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
wher(181,9)went(9,6)as sure of hearing i(988,6)ed of(435,6)sight of
Miss(410,7)was odious to her. As her successor in(973,6)house, she
regarded her(874,6)jealous abhorrence. (354,9)Charlotte came to see
them, she conclu(80,8)to be anticipat(300,8)hour of possession;(275,8)(456,30) to (1008,11), was convinced that
they were talking of the(982,11)estat(710,7)resolving to turn herself
(740,6)r daughters out(77,8)house as soon as Mr(604,13)dead. She
complained bitterly of all thi(429,8) husband.

“Indeed,(83,11),” said she, “it is(665,6)hard to think(476,6)(418,9)
(946,6)should ever be mistress(278,6)is(524,8)that _I_(48,8)be forced(952,9)wa(945,6)_her_(317,6)liv(516,8)(496,6)ake my place in it!”

“My dear, do not giv(80,6)to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for

Thi(811,6)not(988,6)consol(513,7)Mrs(455,8); and, therefore, instead of
making any answer(766,6)went (528,6)before.

“I cannot bear(429,15)they(418,8)have(535,10)(676,6). If it was
not for the entail, I(479,8)not mind it.”

“What(28,12)you mind?”

“(54,18)anything at all.”

CHAPTER XXIV.(35,19)Miss Bingley’s l(846,6)arrived(972,6)put an end to doubt. The(806,6)first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter(125,6)concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire(925,7) he left
(575,6)untry.

Hope was over, entirely over(533,6)when Ja(644,9)att(311,7)the rest of

Elizabeth, to whom(586,6)very soon communicat(864,7)(443,9)all this,
heard it in silent indignation(481,6)heart was divided between concern
for her sister and resentment(523,6)st all others. To(526,9)’s
asser(687,8)(353,20)partial to(673,11)(782,6)paid no
credit. That h(889,6)really fond of Jane(835,6)doubted no more than she
had ever done(933,6)much as she had always(594,6)dispos(662,6)like him, she
(977,6)not think without anger, hardly(22,9)contempt, on(932,6)easiness
of temp(957,9)wa(743,6)proper resolution,(751,7)now made him the slave
of his designing friends(863,6)led(48,6)o sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice(951,13)li(564,6)s. Had(60,18), however, been
the only(112,10), he might have(948,6)allow(1015,6)sport(919,6)it in
whatever manner he thought best; but(664,11)’s was involved in it, as
s(58,11)he must be sensible himself. I(776,6)a subject, in short, on
(385,6)reflection would be long indulged(371,6)(102,8)unavailing. S(570,9)(566,6)of nothing els(657,7)yet, whether Bingley’s regard had
(760,7)died away, or were suppressed by his(519,8)’ interference;

situation remained(790,6)am(42,7)peace equally wounded.

A day or two pa(309,6)efore Jan(280,6)courage(671,6)eak of her feelings to
Elizabeth(657,6)at las(1003,6)Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a
longer irrit(209,6)than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,--

“O that my dear mo(511,6)ad more command over herself!(84,6)an(944,6)no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual(810,11)s on him. But I
will not repine. It canno(317,6) long. He will be forgot(858,6)we shall
a(28,6)as we(768,6)(448,6).”
(406,10) looked at(568,11) with incredulous solicitude, but said
(925,7).

“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you(319,9)reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance but(466,6)is all. I(422,8)thing either to hope or fear, an(215,9) to reproach him with. Thank God(83,11) _that_ pain. A little
time, therefore--I(410,6) certainly try to get the better----”

With a str(763,6)voice she soon added, “(218,7)this comfort immediately,
(264,6)t has not been(727,6)than an error of fancy on my side(594,6)(65,7)
has done no harm to anyon(368,6)myself.”

“M(840,7)Jane,” exclaimed (632,9), “you are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you. I feel as if I had never(209,6)you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.”

Miss Bennet eagerly dis(226,8)all extraordinary meri(924,7)threw back
the praise on(892,11)’s warm affection.

“Nay,” sai(322,14)this i(470,6)fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectabl(478,7)are hurt(281,6)speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want
(90,9)_you_ perfec(226,7)you set yourself against it. D(421,6)be
afraid(954,6) running in(593,6) excess,(31,7)encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
whom I(589,8)lov(752,7)still fewer of (39,7)(333,6)well. The(834,6)I see
of the (353,6)t(28,8)am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief (82,7)inconsistency of all human characters(933,6)(132,6)
little dependence(958,6)can be placed on the appearance of either(686,6)
or sense. I have met(191,6)two instances lately: one I will not mention,
the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in(288,7)view it
(35,17)”

“My dear Lizzy, d(607,6)give way to such feelings as these. They will
rui(596,6) happiness(573,6)(78,7)make allowance enough for differe(319,6)

ready to(653,6)ve, for(688,6)body’s sake,(130,10)may feel something like
regard(750,6)steem for our cousin.”

“To oblige you, I would tr(131,12) almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by(512,6)a(854,8)as this; for were I persuaded that(390,10) had any (197,7)for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding than I now do(35,7) heart. (704,8)Jane,(547,12) is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as
I do(478,6)you must feel(36,12) I do(467,7)the woman who(938,6)es him
cannot have a proper way of(266,6)ing(830,6)shall not defend her, though

yourself or m(728,9)elfishness i(914,8)ce,(87,7)sensi(959,6) of
danger security(558,6)appiness.”

“I(376,6)(560,6)your language too strong in speak(205,7)both,” replied
Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by see(645,6)em happy
together. But enough(447,7)(387,7)alluded to(976,11)else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I (545,7)mis(774,10)(984,6)but I entreat
you,(764,6)Lizzy, not to pain me b(858,7)ing _that person_ to blam(393,6)

(511,6)ves int(222,6)ally injured(66,14)expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often no(357,6)but
our own vanity(913,6)deceives us. Women(186,6) admiration means more than
it doe(636,6)And men take ca(35,6)t they should(675,6)f (922,6)designedly done,(42,6)(1021,7)be justified;(471,7)have no idea
of there being so much(85,7) in the world as some(477,7)s imagine(817,7)am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to(196,7),”
said Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy,(219,7)may be error and(23,14)misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of at(616,7) to(98,6) people’s feelings, and (50,8)resolution,
will do the busines(488,10)do you impute it to either(998,6)ose?”

“Yes; t(69,6)last. But if I go on I shall displease you by (884,7)what I
think of(452,9)you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”

“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him(191,8), in conjunction with his frien(724,7)(695,10)lieve it. Wh(760,8)(772,6)try to(102,15) T(757,7)

in the best (123,8)(19,6)light in which it(804,8)understood.”

Elizabeth(402,11)(625,6)(387,7) wish; and(862,6)this time Mr. Bingley’s
name was scarcely (763,6)entioned between them.

Mrs. Bennet still continu(598,6)(865,7)and repine at his returning no
more(156,6)though a day seldom passed(260,10)(236,10)di(682,6)account
for it clearly,(798,7)seemed little chance of her(221,6)considering it
with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavour(828,6)convince her of what
she(161,9)(886,7) (979,7), th(264,7)att(347,6)s to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common(303,6)ransient liking,(551,7)ceased when he saw
her no (363,6)but(363,8)the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, sh(173,6)the same story to repeat(994,6) day. (552,11)’s best
comfort was(273,7)(651,11) must be down again(787,8)summer.

Mr(635,9)treate(139,6)matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one
day, “your(926,7) is cro(628,8)love, I find. I congratulate her. Next
to being married, a girl likes to be(87,16) a(661,8)now and

that kind may befall(193,6)you have an affectionate mother who will
always make(806,6)ost of it.”(843,6)(359,7)’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him often(768,6)to his (226,6)recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy(914,6)(716,6)at he had suffered from him,
(152,7) openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased(557,10)how mu(375,6)y(184,7)ways dislike(633,6)Darcy before they

CHAPTER XXV.(34,19)After a week spent in professions of love(252,6)chemes of felicity, Mr.

would be fixed(940,6)was to make him the happie(458,10) He took leave

O(859,6)following Monday, Mrs.(981,8)ha(778,7)leasure of receiving her
br(98,6)and his wife,(1015,6)am(432,6)usual, to spen(859,6)Christmas at
(288,9). Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education(704,6)Netherfield

eldes(134,6)herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.
They had frequently(315,7)taying(149,10)in town.

distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done, sh(605,6)a less active(157,6)to play. It becam(113,6)turn to listen.
(938,16)many grievances to relat(651,7)much to complain of. They
had all(639,6)very ill-used since she last saw her(864,7). Two of her
girls had(710,6)o(504,6)point of marriag(791,7)after all(502,7)was nothing
in it.

“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane(949,12)got Mr.
Bingley if(55,7)uld. But, Lizzy! Oh,(205,7)! it is(629,6)hard to think
that she might(939,11)Mr. Collins’s wife by(489,6)time, had not it
been for her own perverseness. He mad(602,6)an off(703,7)h(148,8)room,
and she refused him. T(276,6)sequence of(205,6), that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter(412,6)ed before I hav(565,7)(64,6)(987,9)estate is just as
much entailed as ever(146,6)Lucases are(971,6)artful people, indeed,

them, but so(457,6). It makes m(128,7)nervou(945,6)poorly, to be thwarted

greatest of comforts(966,6)I am(932,6)gla(151,6)ea(299,7)you tell us of
long sleeves.”

Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief(199,6)is new(970,11)given(540,7), in
t(843,6)rse of(892,6)and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her,(740,9)(501,7) a slight answer, and, in compassion(228,6)r nieces, turned the
conversation.

When alon(114,7)(146,9) afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.
“It seems likely(506,9)been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I

such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in lov(371,7)a pretty

[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

“An excellent consolation in its way(424,8)(687,9); “but it will not
do for _us_. We do not suffer by(304,9). It does not(450,6)(466,7)

independent fortune to think no(699,7)f a girl(969,6)he was violently in

“(661,6)at expre(885,6)of ‘(74,12) love’ is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite(550,7)it gives m(530,7)little idea. It is as
(316,6)applied to feelings which arise(197,6)from a half hour’s
acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _(302,7) was_
(858,11)’s love?”

“I never saw a(379,6)promising inclination;(387,8)growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was(514,6)decided and remarkable. At his own ball he

spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? I(832,6)general incivility th(566,7)ess(833,8)(408,9)Oh, yes! of(704,6)kind(34,8)(568,7)I suppose(178,6)o have felt. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because,(832,6)her disposition, she ma(307,6)get
over it immediately. It had better(124,6)happen(741,6)_you_, Lizzy; you
would(165,6)laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would
be prevailed on to go back(208,6)us? Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a(958,8)relief(907,6)hom(266,6)be as useful as
anything.”

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased(358,6)this proposal(798,6)felt persuaded
of her sister’s ready acquiescence.

“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration(488,6)regard to
this(801,7)man will influence(929,6)We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are(53,13), and, as you well know, we go
out so(384,7),(752,6)it is(800,6)improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to se(209,6)”

“And _that_ is quite impossible;(800,7) is now in the custody of his

impurities, were he once to enter it;(522,6)depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him.”

“So much the better. (784,6)(539,6)will not(541,12). But does not Jane
correspon(924,7)his(887,7)? _She_(74,10)be (635,6)o help call(1017,7)“She(828,6)drop the acquaintance entirely.”

But, in spite of(603,6)ertainty in which Elizabeth affected to(452,7)this
point, as(840,6)as the still(637,6)interesting one of(347,8)’s being
withheld(444,6)seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude o(779,6)subject(171,6)

hopeless. It was (910,8)(866,6)sometimes she thought it probable(104,6)

successfully combated by the(985,6)natural(67,14)Jane’s
attractions.

The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn(274,6)what(940,6)the Philipses,
the Lucases(483,10)officers, there wa(1021,6)a day(157,9)its

warm commend(752,6)of him, narrowly observed them both. W(577,7)supposing
them, from(525,6)she saw,(182,7)very seriously in love, their preference
of each(847,6) was plain enough to make(940,6) little uneasy(924,6)she
resolved to speak to(246,10) (313,6) subject before she left

heard Mr. Fitzwilliam(583,7)(705,6)ly spoken of as a(985,7)roud,
ill-natured boy.

CHAPTER XXVI.(71,16)](790,15)’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually(808,6)indly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after
honestly tell(776,8)w(358,8)thought(522,7)hus went on:--

“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against(520,8), therefore, I am not afraid(219,12)
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to(34,8)(790,6)in an affec(1024,11)the want of
fortune(129,7)make so(620,6)imprudent. I(155,6)no(845,6)to say(258,8)
_him_: he is a most interesting young man(817,6)if he had the (129,8)he
ought to have, I should think(708,7)uld not do better. But as it is--you
must not let(326,6)fancy run away(961,6)you. You(375,6)sense,(978,6)e all
expect you to use it. Y(79,6)ther(438,7)depend on _your_ resol(805,6)and
good conduct(539,7)sure(124,6)(171,9)disappoin(178,9)ther.”

“My dear aunt, this is being s(582,6) indeed.”

“Yes(200,6)I hope to engag(603,6)to be(55,9)likewise.”

“Well, then, you nee(365,6)be under any alarm. I will take care of
my(660,6)and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall(85,8)(873,8)with me, if I
can prevent it.”

“Elizabeth(153,6)are not(253,9)now.”

“I beg(823,6)pardon(167,10)r(687,7). At present(935,10)(137,12)

the(779,6)agreeable man I ever saw--(782,10)becomes really attached to
me--I believe it(376,6)be(768,7) that he(813,8)not. I see the(965,9)ce
of it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My(736,7)’s opinion of me does
m(89,6)greatest honour(987,6)(947,9)be miserable to forfeit it. My
(832,6), however, is partial to(569,12). In short, m(776,13)I
(108,10)very sorry(736,7)the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see, every day,(346,6)where there is affection young people are
seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
(935,6)ments(788,6)each o(300,9) can I promise(971,7)wis(518,6)n so many
of my fellow-creatures(863,6) am tempted, or how am(663,6)n to know that
it w(462,8)(102,7)o resist? All(635,6)I (945,6)(148,6)you,(302,6)fore, is
not(406,7)in a hurry(921,9)not(26,14)(449,6)(749,6)myself his
first object. When(958,6)in(885,6)ny(306,6)him,(92,15)wishing. In
(586,7)(125,7)do my best.”

“Perhaps(868,12)as well i(568,6)discourage his coming here so very
often. At least you(923,11) _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”

“As I did the(515,6) day,” said Elizabeth,(553,6)a conscious smile; “very
true,(210,12)wise in me(462,6)frain(653,6)_that_. But do not imagine
that h(770,6)lways(245,9)(240,7)It is (791,6)r account(834,6)he has been
so frequently(245,6)ed this week. You(642,6)my(286,7)’s ideas as to the
necessity of constant(520,9)for her friends(208,6)really, and upon my
honour(559,9)t(637,6)do w(728,6)think(870,11)st; and now I hope you
are satisfied.”

Her aunt assured h(929,6)t she was(71,6)(452,11)having thank(48,7)for
the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point without (36,6)resented.

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode(974,6)the
Lucases,(28,6)rrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His
marriage(56,7)w fast approaching(473,6)(415,7) at length so far resigned

tone,(533,10)“_wished_(473,6)might be happy.” Thursday w(774,6)be the

Charlotte said,--

“I shall depe(290,6)hearing from you very often(240,7).”

“_That_ you certainly(76,6).”

“And I have anot(349,6)vour to ask. Will(63,6)ome(609,6)ee me?”

“We(152,7)often meet, I hope, in(869,14).”

“I am not like(605,6)leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford.”

(485,9) could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

“My father and Maria are to(267,6)to me in March,” added (446,9), “and
(270,6) you will consent(768,7)(540,7)party. Indeed(687,7),(52,10)be

The (847,7) took place: the brid(449,6)bridegroom set off for(386,7)rom

correspondence was as regula(405,6)frequent as it ever had been: that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible(165,12)(581,7)ever

and(651,9)determine(681,6)to slacken as a (253,12)t, it was for(349,6)ake of what(242,9) r(687,6)than(26,6)was.(657,10)’s first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness:(896,6)(858,11)but be

like Lady Catherine(628,6)how happy(82,11)dare pronounce herself to
be;(1001,7), when the(237,8) (237,7)a(863,8)beth felt(552,6)(951,9)
expressed(91,9)on(765,6) point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surround(373,8)(565,7)s(872,6)mentio(536,7)hing

Rosings rationally softened; and(900,11)per(670,7)that(367,6)ust wait
for her own visit(676,6),(650,9)the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines(275,8)sister, to an(614,7)their
safe arrival in London(181,6)when(760,6)rote again(619,12)hoped it
(792,6)be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second(982,7) was as well rewarded as(58,11)
generally is. (283,9)been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last(192,8)(664,7)(617,6)(94,6)Longbourn(167,6)(294,6) accident been
lost.

“My aunt,”(816,7)ntinued, “is going to-morrow into(1023,6)part(371,7)
(249,6)and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”

S(526,14)(547,6)the(686,7)was pai(928,6) sh(673,6)seen Miss(507,8).

     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumph(605,6)(70,6)her b(162,6)judgment, at my expense, when I confess my(572,6)o have(141,6)been entirely(274,8)d in(547,16)regard for me.

“Yours, etc.”

This l(241,6)gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits(386,7)ed, as she
considere(270,7)Jane(977,7)no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation(556,6)the brother was now absolutely over. Sh(112,10)t

Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a ki(596,6)(663,6)er think

worn out, like his information.

It (754,6)journey of only twenty-four mile(456,7)they began it so early

particulars also of Miss Bingley’s vis(649,6)Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurr(480,7)different times between(305,7)nd
herself, which pro(407,7)t the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.

(251,14)then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion(221,6)complim(816,6)her on bearing it so well.

“But, my dear (698,9),” she added, “what sort of girl is(369,6)King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”

“Pray(122,10)aunt, what is the(380,9)ce in matrimonial affairs,

“No--why (688,7)he? If it(477,6)not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections(457,10)I had no money(711,7)occasion could there be for
making love to a(852,6)whom he did not care about, and who was equally

“A man(75,6)(347,6)ed circumstances has(441,6)im(312,6)all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If _she_(939,6)not object to it,

“_Her_(44,11)ing(63,10)justify _him_. It(858,6)show(253,6)being

“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_(854,7)be(936,10)(481,6)(247,6)(30,8) foolish.(696,6), Lizzy,(1000,6)is(958,6)I do _not_(99,9)I(733,8)be sorry, you know,

CHAPTER XXVIII.(59,16)]

Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to
(930,9);(930,8) spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
seen(59,6)ister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health(551,6)the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of(1004,8).

When they lef(343,6)high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in

The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. (416,9)
smiled a(552,6)(899,9)ion of all that(404,8) heard of its inhabitants.

At length(216,14) was discernible. The garden slop(563,6) the

i(938,6)ly(672,6)her cousin’s manners(496,6)not alter(396,6)his m(449,7):
his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detain(287,7)some

everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was(803,6)ble to gratify him

owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
through (555,6)walk and cross walk(471,6)scarcely allow(65,7)m an
interval to utter the praises he asked for,(101,7)view was pointed out(273,6)a minuteness(953,7)left beauty entirely behind. H(850,8)numb(122,6)

handsome modern building,(900,6)situated on rising ground.

be delight(581,8)her. She is all affability(671,8)descension(92,7)
doubt not but(205,10)b(199,8)(673,8)some portion of her notice when
service is over. I(886,6)scarcely any hesitation in saying(481,6)she(214,6)include you and my sister Maria in(855,6) inv(76,8)with(803,6) she
(384,6)s us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear(851,11)is
charming. We dine at Rosings twice(139,7)week(796,6)are never allowed to
walk hom(121,7)Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
_should_ say, one(386,8)(76,19)s, for she has several.”

“(838,15)is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added(1020,10), “and a most attentive neighbour.”

“Very true,(357,8),(979,6)is exactly what I say(703,9)the sort of
woman whom one cannot regar(761,7)too much deference.”

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again(171,6)had been already written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth, i(1008,6)solitud(454,9)chamber, had to meditate upon(369,10)’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband(717,6)to acknowledge(438,7)t
was all done(575,6)well(442,6)had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employment(45,7)vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collin(443,6) the gaieties(89,10)intercourse
with(979,8). A lively imagination soon settled it all.

About the middle(184,7) next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusio(639,6), after list(763,6)a mo(551,6)she heard somebody running
upstairs in a violent hurry(525,6)ca(775,6)loudly(101,7)her(946,6)opened
the door(576,6)met Maria(760,8)landing-place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,--

“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste(261,6)ome into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you w(856,6) is. Make
haste(374,7)ome down this(457,7).”

Elizabeth asked ques(777,6)in vain;(379,7)would(109,6)her nothing more;
and(94,8)ey ran(221,21) which fronte(854,6)lane, in(120,6)
of(160,6)wonder; it was two(392,7), stopping(609,6)low phaeton at the
garden gate.

“And is(247,6)all?”(527,7)(249,9). “I expected at least th(80,6) pigs
were got(437,10)(103,6)(724,6)(431,8)(277,8)but Lady Catherin(502,6)her
daughter!”

“La!(558,8),” said(744,6), quite shock(149,6)the mistake, “it(111,7) Lady

other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at(937,10)is(164,7)a little
creature. Who(559,7)have thought she could be so thin and small!”

“(90,7)abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all(570,7)ind.
Why does she not(881,8)?”(932,7)(74,10)say(39,6)hardly ever does. It(570,6)e greatest of favours
when(301,15) comes in.”

“I like her appearance(488,8)(888,9), struck(400,6)(390,7)deas. “She
looks sickly(971,6)ross. Yes, she will do for him very well(425,6)will
make him a(31,6)proper wife.”

Mr. Collins and(360,11)were both standing(653,8)gate in conversation
(596,8)(942,7); and Sir William, to(890,10)’s high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of(423,10)ness

way.

to dine at Rosing(814,6)next day.

CHAPTER XXIX.(137,16)](758,13)’s triumph,(724,7)sequence(603,6)is invi(665,6), was complete.
The power of display(327,7) grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors(689,6)of(399,14)see her civility towards himself and his
wife(162,6)exactly what he had wished for(924,6)that an opportunity of
doing it should b(398,8)s(662,6) was such an insta(299,7)Lady
(471,9)’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

“I confess,”(537,6)he, “that I(147,8)not(551,6)been at all surprised by
her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening
(732,10). I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that
it would happen. But who c(22,7)ve foreseen(348,9)attent(315,7)this?
W(51,14)imagine(459,7)we(435,8)receive(417,6)(699,8) (946,7)

immediately after your arrival?”

“I am the less(408,11)at(656,7)as(265,7)ed,” replied Sir William,
“from(675,6)(351,13)what the manners(932,6)e great really are, which
my situ(258,6)in life has allowed me to acquire. Abou(97,6)court, such
(743,8)s of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”

Scarcely anything was talked(180,8)(347,6)day or next morning b(132,6)ir
visit to(649,10)Mr. Collins was carefully instruct(443,7)m in what
they were to(704,7)(665,6) the sight of(981,6)rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.

When(530,6)adies(140,6)separating for the toilette, he(1022,6)to
Elizabeth,--

“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about(674,7)pparel. Lady
Catherine is far(973,6)requir(763,6)at(490,7)ce of dress in us(603,7)becomes he(132,6)and daughter. I(1010,7)advise you merely to put on

being simply(238,6)ed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.”

While (632,10)dressing, he came two or three tim(98,6)their different
doors, to recommend(36,7)(175,6)quick, as(242,16)very much
objected to be kept wai(632,9)her(714,7). Such formidable accounts of
her Ladyship, and her mann(449,6)living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little us(158,6)company; and she looked forward to her
introdu(382,6)at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presenta(80,8)St. James’s.

As(559,6)e(61,6)was fine,(477,6)had a pleasant walk of(887,7)half a mile
acros(75,6)park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw(229,6)(466,6)pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins exp(551,7)he scene to inspire(496,6)was but

From the entranc(364,8)of which(635,13)pointed out,(966,7)(679,7)ous air, the fine propor(1019,6)nd finished ornaments(921,7)followed
the servants through an antechamber(527,8)room where Lady (376,9),
her daughter(781,6)Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship(211,7)great
condescension, arose to receive them; and(927,6)s(928,10)had settled it

awed by the grandeur surrounding him,(814,6)(858,7)but just(901,8)

and his(542,11)frightened almost out of her senses, sat on(803,6)dge
(31,7)chair, not knowing(816,7)way to look. Elizabeth found herself

(514,9)’s mind; and, from the(486,7)ation(953,6)e day altogether, she
believed(486,16)to be exactly w(840,11)represented.

When, after examin(393,7) mo(102,6)in whose countenance and deportment

being so thin and so small. Ther(552,7)either in figure nor face any

After sitt(65,6)few minut(309,6)ey(296,6)all sent to one(787,8)windows to

looking at(268,8)summer.

The dinner(368,6)xceedingly handsom(402,7)(436,7)(255,8)the servant(168,7)(22,8)articles of plate which(258,13)had promised; and, as he

(655,10)seemed gratified by their excessive admiration(989,6)gave most
gracious smiles, especially when an(307,7)o(964,6)table proved a novelty
to them. The party did not supply(789,6)conversation.(252,12)as ready
to speak whenever(760,8)as an opening, but sh(24,6)seated between
Charlot(539,7)Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom(888,6)ngaged in

subject in so deci(853,6) (969,7)as(784,8)tha(662,10)not us(238,6)have

concerns familiarly and minutely(990,11)her a great deal of advice as(943,7) managemen(496,8)m all; told her how(261,6)(486,6)(552,6)(408,6)regulat(693,6)so small a(155,6)y as hers(817,6)instructe(86,6)as(514,7)

necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?”

“A little.”

“Oh then--some time or(1009,6) we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you(91,7)try it

“No, not at all(171,7)at, no(199,6)you(41,7)t on(405,6)That is(767,6)strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your (918,6)

have been quite a slave t(699,7)educati(249,6)Elizabeth c(397,7)rdly help smiling, as she assured her(219,6)(481,6)t
been the case.

“Then who taugh(326,6) who attended(141,7)? W(242,18), you(203,16)neglected.”

“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but(310,6)of us as

idle certainly might.”

“Ay, no doubt: but(596,6)is wha(552,13) will prevent; and if I had
known(735,6)(891,6), I (894,12)advis(474,7)most strenuously to engage

wonderful how many(519,9) I(218,6)(667,9)means(830,6)pplying in that

“Yes, ma’am, all(901,6)ll! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And(266,6)nly the second. The(129,9)ones out before the elder(559,6)arried! You(472,7)(181,11)must

amusement, becaus(293,12)may(69,13)(987,8)r inclination to
marry early. The last born has as good a right(665,6)e pl(637,6)s(569,7)th
as(801,6)irst. And(307,7)kept back on _such_ a motive!(301,17)
not(305,9)likely to promote(663,7)ly affection or delicacy of mind.”

“Upon my word,”(787,6)her Ladyship, “you give your opinion(566,6)decidedly
for so(518,7)a person. Pray, what is(65,6)age?”

“With three(666,17)grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling(154,6)r
(170,8) can hardly expect me to own it.”

Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
an(146,11) suspected herself(775,7)(489,9) creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

“You can(515,7)m(1015,6)an twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal(401,9).”

“I am not one-and-(81,6).”

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed. (396,14), Sir Willia(76,7)Mr.(8,7)s. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting(126,6)Jenkinson to make up her
party. Their(230,6) was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syll(46,8)
uttered that did(637,7)late to(375,6)ame, except when(152,15)
express(643,6) fears of(273,15)’s being too hot or too cold, or

soon(440,9)had driven f(211,7) door, Elizabeth was called on by her
cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But
her commendation,(835,7) cost(927,8)some trouble, could by no means
satisfy(1022,12)(929,6)h(856,6)very soon oblig(699,6)tak(254,6)(1021,8)’s

(186,8)ladies all felt(498,9)must add considerably to the(1007,6)u(789,6)their engagements at Rosings. I(316,6)some days(896,11)before they

such an attention(556,9)n(50,11)merely asked on leaving church to

only(167,6)at(239,7).

The(510,12)was accepted, of course(887,6)at a proper hour(504,6)joined
the party in(243,15)’s drawing-room. H(278,7)ship (649,9)them

(522,20)seemed really glad to see them: anything(443,6)
welcome relief to him at Rosings(912,6)Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,
moreover, caught his fancy(742,6)much. He now seated himself(303,7), and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling(415,6)taying
at hom(35,6)new books and music,(544,6)Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained(996,6)at room befor(536,7)they conversed with so much
spiri(193,6)flow as to draw the attention of(1023,16)herself, as(141,6)as of(945,10). _His_ eyes had(191,6)soon and repeatedly turned
towards them(166,6)a look of curiosity(211,8)at h(893,11), after a
while, shar(907,6) feeling, was(710,6)openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,--

“What is(968,6)you are saying,(754,12)? (42,8)i(40,10)talking
of(31,7)are you t(555,7)Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”

“We we(81,10) of(576,8)madam,” said he, when no longer ab(214,6)avoid
a reply.

“O(67,7)! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my(390,6)(666,6)e(643,8)ation, if(316,10)pea(196,13).
There are few people in England, I suppose, who(113,7)ore true
enjoyment(279,9) than my(691,6)or a better natural taste. If I had ever
learnt, I should(218,6)been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her
heal(973,7)allowed her to apply. I am confident(971,6)she(76,7)have
performed(368,8)fully. How does Georgiana get on,(906,6)?”

(919,9) spoke(864,7)ffectionate praise of his sister’s(223,10)cy.

“I am very glad to(669,6)such a good accou(379,6)her(649,8)Lady

“So much the(602,7). It(194,8)be done to(39,6); and(921,6)I next write
to her(624,6)all charge her not to neglect it on any(368,8). I often
tell young ladies(338,7)n(320,7)lence in(794,7)is to be acquired without

never play really well, unless s(349,13)more(287,6)though Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she i(405,7)welcome, as(171,8)often told
her, to come to Rosings every day, and(169,6)on the pianoforte in(139,6)Jenkinson’s room. S(936,9)be in nobody’s way, you know, in(984,6)part

When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having

drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listen(111,6)half a so(228,8)then
talked, as before, (825,6) other nephew; till the latter walked away from(529,6)and moving with his usual deliberation towards(534,15),
stationed himself so as(616,7)mand a full view (503,7)fair performer’s
countenance.(390,11)saw what h(451,6)do(495,9)at(74,6)irst
convenient pause tur(324,8)im(217,6)an arch smile(747,6)said,--

“You mean to frighten me, (664,9), by coming in all this state(385,6)ar
me. But I will not be alarmed,(980,8)your sister _does_(886,6)so well.
There is a stubbornness about me(841,6)never can bear to be(190,9)ed at
the(138,6)of(542,6)s. My courage always rises(511,6)every attempt to
intimidate me.”

“I sha(221,7)say(981,6)you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of(326,6)ing you(894,6)I
have had(664,6)leasure of(355,6)acquaintance long enough to know,(188,9)

are not(484,6)own.”

(721,10)laughed heartily(711,6)is pict(187,7)herself(675,10) to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin(625,6)giv(356,6)a very pretty notion of

and such things may come out as(983,6)shock(749,6)relations to hear(941,7)am not afraid(795,7),”(601,6)he, smilingly.

“Pray let me hear w(989,8)h(213,7)accuse him of,” cried (671,7)
(671,11). “I should like(885,8) how he behaves among strangers.”

“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something(748,6)dreadful. The
first time of my ever seeing him(454,17), you must know, was at
a ball--and(942,9)ball,(284,6)do(580,6)hink he did? He danced only four
dances!(851,6)sorry(728,6)(645,6), but so it was.(67,27), though gentlemen were scarce; and,(695,7)certain knowledge, more

Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You(688,6)employed your
time much better. No one admitt(919,6)the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. We neither of us perform(983,13).”

Here they were(685,6)rupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what(69,11)talking of.(694,10) immediately began playing again.
(109,14) approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to(1003,7)--

“Miss Bennet(588,11)play at all amiss if she(593,8)ed more, and
could(791,6)the advanta(401,6)a London (875,6). She has a very good notion
of(980,7)ing, though her taste(701,8)equal to Anne’s. Anne(775,7)have
been a delightful(477,8)er, had her health allowe(19,6)to learn.”

(407,10)looked at(309,7) to see how cordially he assen(664,7)his
cousin’s praise: but(629,9)a(901,7)moment nor at(871,11)(339,6)she
discern any symptom of love; and from the who(1013,6)his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for (528,6)ingley,(165,6)he might(351,11)just as likely to marry _her_(358,6)she been his relation.

with them many instructions on execution and(578,6)(878,12)received

CHAPTER XXXII.(36,19)(714,10)was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she(140,6)tartled by a ring(350,8)door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she(979,7)ard no(337,9), she thought it not un(688,10)be(650,15)(846,6)under(924,6)apprehension was pu(317,6)away her

Darcy only, entered(685,6)oom.

He seemed asto(181,7)too on finding her alone(518,6)apologized for his
intrusion, by le(592,6)her know(314,6)(405,7)understood(860,9)ladies to
be within.

They then sat down(645,7)hen her inquiries after Rosings(632,6)made,
(219,7)in danger of sinking(649,7)otal silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something(556,6)in this emergency
recollecting _when_(675,9)seen him last in Hertfordshir(368,7)feeling
curious to(342,6)w(342,7)would say o(562,6)subject of their hasty
departur(775,7)observed,--

“How(594,6)suddenly you all quitted Netherfield(174,6)November,(631,10)!
It must have been a most agreeable(686,10)to Mr. Bingley to see you
all(469,7)him so soon; for, if I (340,9) right, he went but(822,6)ay
before. He and his sister(548,7)well, I hope,(600,6)you left London?”

“Perfectly so, I thank you.”

She found(994,10)was to receive no other answer; and,(691,7)a short
pause, add(400,8)I(609,7)I(330,6)(822,11)that(312,13)has not much idea of ever
returning to(448,13)agai(221,6)(96,7)never heard(371,6)ay so; but it is probable(973,9)may spend
very little of his time(817,6) in futu(393,7)has many friends(980,6)he is
at a(58,6)of life(1004,6)(42,7) and engagements are continually
increasing.”

“If he means to be but(167,8)at(720,12), it(839,7)be better for the
neighbourh(382,9)he should give up the place entirely,(65,8)n we
might possibly get a settled family(303,6). But, perhaps(859,6)(801,8)did
not take the house so(507,6)(177,7) convenience of the (196,14)as
for his own(386,6)we(952,6)expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle(366,6)(274,8)not b(997,10)d,” said Darcy, “if(940,6)re to(320,6)it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.”

Elizabeth made no(860,7). S(896,7)afraid of talking longer(672,7)
(638,6)(908,7)having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
troub(760,6)finding a subject to him.

He took(437,6)int and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it(838,6)Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford(456,7)(78,7) she did--and I am sur(23,6)c(490,9)have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.”

“Mr. (143,8)appears(242,6)fortunate in his choi(714,6)a wif(623,6)Yes, indeed; his (465,6)s may well rejoic(70,9)(484,7)met with one of
the(119,7)ew sensible women who would(230,6)accepted him, or(252,6)made

As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which(268,10) fancied she

Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--

More than(829,6)did(411,12)(461,7)ramble with(176,7)park,

misch(320,7)at should bring him where no one els(402,6)brought; and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,
that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it(768,7)occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did(628,6)eve(511,6)third. It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance(1008,6)on(645,7)occasions(206,7)
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself(291,6)rouble of talking
or of list(491,6)much; but it struck her (868,8)ours(65,6)heir(373,6)

Fitzwilliam in his(625,8)s? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise(547,6)at quarter. It distresse(415,6)a little(955,6)s(553,7)quite glad to fi(460,6)self at the gat(96,7)e

S(638,7)engaged one day, as(113,7)lked, in re-perusing Jane’s last
letter(597,6)dwelling on(714,6)passages which prove(583,7)Jane had not
written(604,6)irits, when, instead of(742,8)(515,6)urprised by Mr. Darcy,
she saw, on looking up,(875,6)(490,7) (490,12)was meeting her.
Putting away the (225,6) immediately(834,6)forcing a smile, (124,6)id,--

“I did not know before(1011,6)you ever(351,7) this way.”

“I(662,6)been m(870,6)the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally
do every yea(413,7)intend(780,6)close it with a call(575,8)(544,11)Are you going much farther?”

“No, I sh(847,6)ave turned in a moment.”

And accordingly she did turn(733,6)they(270,9)owards(684,14)
together.

“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.

“Yes--if(554,6) does not put it off(603,6). But I am at his disposal. He
arrange(159,6)business just as he pleases.”

“And if not able to(31,7) himself(935,7) (86,7)ment, he has at least
great(88,6)ur(986,8) power of choice. I do(624,10)anybody who seems
more to enjo(730,6)(67,9)doing what he likes than(858,10).”

“H(28,9)o(677,6)his own way very well,”(663,8)(881,20).
“But so we all do. It is only(937,6)(258,7)b(890,6)means of having it than
many others, because he is rich(934,6)(37,11) are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inur(830,6)self-denial and
dependence(962,6)n my opinion, the(91,12) of an earl can(430,6)very little of
either. Now, seriously,(418,7)av(918,6)ever known of(149,27)? When(56,10)been prevented by want of money from(1011,6)
wherever(880,6)hose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”

“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot sa(514,7)I have
experience(458,7)hardships of(556,6)nature(950,6)in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer(229,6)the(252,14). Y(517,10)s(150,8)marry(268,6) they lik(491,6)Unless (27,15) women of fortune, which I think(69,6)very often
do.”

“Our habits of expense make us too (618,8)t(733,6)ther(350,6)(167,6)ny in
my rank of life who can afford to(209,6) without some attention to
(268,6)”

“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pra(760,8)is
the usual price(843,11)’s(959,12)? (409,7)the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppos(851,6)would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”

He answered her in the same style(421,9) subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence(551,7)might(504,6)him(850,7)her affected with(278,6)had passed,
she soon afterwards said,--

“I imagine your cousin br(471,6)you down(91,6)him chiefly for(216,7)ke of
having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does(669,7)rry, to secure a
lasting convenien(466,6)that kind. But, perhaps, his sister(87,6)as well
(161,8)present; and, as she is u(141,6)is sole care, he may do(327,7)e
likes(255,7)er.”

“No,”(671,6)Colonel Fitzwilliam, “t(664,6) an advantag(452,8)he must
divide(433,6)me. I am join(454,8)him(570,8)guardianship of Miss Darc(908,6)Are you, indeed? (801,8)(800,6)sort of a(72,9) do you make? Does
(507,6)harge giv(758,6)much trouble? Young ladies of(633,6)ge are sometimes
a little difficult to manage; and if she ha(903,6)true(205,6) spirit, she
may like to have her own way.”

A(455,6)spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly(131,6)the manner
in(409,10)immediately ask(959,7)why(107,6)upposed(383,11) likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinc(78,7)that(256,7)d somehow or other
got pretty nea(864,6)truth. She directly replie(961,7)You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm(447,7)(400,6)I dare

very great favourit(741,7)some(574,11)my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley. I think I(524,8)ard you say(339,6)you know them.”

“I(16,10) (662,8). Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike
man--(217,7)(212,8)riend of(895,6)’s.”

“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr.(738,7)is uncommonly kind to Mr.
(235,7),(672,6)akes a prodigious deal of care of hi(230,6)C(16,10)! Yes, I really believ(861,8)_does_ take(69,12) in

to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for(528,8)no ri(39,7)(935,7)
that(102,9)was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”

“What is i(601,6)mean?”

“It(563,6)circumstance which(481,7)of course coul(915,6)wish(193,6)
generally known, because if it were to get rou(542,6)the lady’s family it
would be an un(706,8) thing.”

“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”

“And remember(847,6)(345,9)t(413,6)(447,7)for(353,7)(62,6)(215,7)(936,9)W(532,14) was merely this:(565,9)congratulated himself
on having lately saved a(888,8)from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but withou(252,13)names or any other
particulars; and I only suspected(243,9)(704,9)from(874,7)ing him
the(987,6)of young man(471,8)into a scrape of(839,6)sort(1019,6)from

“Did Mr.(1018,7)give you his(904,7)s for this interference(740,6) understood(997,6)there(669,6)some(948,6)strong objections against the
lady(603,9)what arts did he use to separate them?”

“He di(822,6)talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He
only(644,10)(720,13)w(668,6)you.”

Elizabeth made no answer(396,6)walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little,(174,12) asked her why she
was so thoughtful.

“I am thinking of(329,6)you(529,12)(142,7)me(279,8)she. “Your
cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was(958,6) be the
judg(534,6)You are rather disposed to call (587,16) officious(597,7)do(121,6)e(402,7)right(678,11)had to decide on the propriety(516,7)
friend’s incli(377,6); or why, upon(555,9)judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in(680,6)manner(919,6)(110,6)(55,7) be happy. But,”
she continued, recollect(508,7)self, “as we know non(1011,7)e
particulars, it i(408,6)fair to condemn him. I(31,9)(410,6)supposed
(926,12)as much aff(913,6) i(324,6)case.”

“Tha(104,9)an unnatural surmis(577,9)(856,11); “but(160,6)
lessening the honour of my (617,9)triumph very sadly.”

This was spoken jestingly, (95,7)appear(592,6)her so just a picture of
(557,9),(415,6)she would(284,6)rust(377,8) with an(976,7); and,
therefore, abruptly chang(213,8)conversation, t(1024,8) indifferent
matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut in(217,7)own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, (611,6)uld think witho(79,6)erruption
of all(275,10)had heard. It wa(571,20)(736,6)any other

(169,6)not exist(640,8)world _two_ men over(74,6)(1021,10)(228,6)have
such boundless influence. That (224,7)been concerned(747,8)measures
taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane(352,6)had never doubted; but she
had always attribut(675,6)Miss(79,9)the principal design and
arrangement(1015,7)m. If his own vanity, however, di(715,6)mislead him,
_he_ w(550,6) cause--his pride and caprice were(38,12)(537,11)
Jan(538,6)suffered, and still continu(895,6)(33,6). H(586,6)ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for(391,6)ost affectionate, generous heart
(539,12); and no on(749,8)say how lasting an evil he might(554,6)inflicted.

“Ther(258,7)some very strong obj(139,6)s against the lady,”(310,6)Colonel
Fitzwilliam’s words(160,6)these(81,19)probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney(389,6)anoth(789,6) was in
bus(340,6)in London.

“To (456,6)erself,” she exclaimed, “ther(967,11)no possibility of

excellent, her mind improv(600,8)her manners captivating. Neither(1010,6)

peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself nee(866,6)disdain,
and respect(63,6)y(61,7)he will(481,10)never reach.” When she(153,7)t
of(268,6)o(181,6)indeed(288,6)confidence gave way a little; but she would
not allow that any(703,12)_there_ had material weight(283,6)Mr.
Darcy, whose pride,(97,6)as convinced,(112,6) receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend’s conn(864,8)than from their want
of sense(1002,6)(139,8)quite decided, at last,(248,6)he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of(233,8)and(49,7)(40,6)e wish of
retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.

The agitation(1019,6)ear(595,8)the subject occasioned brought on a
headach(239,7)it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see(727,10), it determine(885,6)not to atte(903,6)
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,

keener sense of(660,7)ster’s(529,10)s. It was some consol(754,6)to

While settl(752,6)is point(70,6)was suddenly roused by(948,6)ound of the

health, imputing(990,14)a wish(820,6)a(718,10)she(448,6)better.
She answered him(731,6)cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked(666,7)the (243,6)Elizabeth(649,7)rprised, but
sa(739,6) a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitat(347,9)(571,6)thus(342,6):--

“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings(25,10)be
repressed. You must allow (667,6)tell you how ardently I admire and love

“In(839,6)cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to(433,8) a sense of obligation(829,9)sentiments avow(725,11)

the acknowledgment of(275,6)regard can(58,7)ittle difficulty in
overcoming it after(912,6)explan(153,6)”

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words(59,6)no less resentment than
surprise. His complexion became pal(125,7)ang(382,8)the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling(830,8)
appear(79,7) composure(750,6)(719,8)t open his lips till he(962,8)d
himself(629,9)attained it(531,6)paus(132,6)to Elizabeth’s(556,9)
dreadful. At length, in a voi(158,6)forced calmness, he said,--

“And(503,6)is all the reply(647,7)I am(790,9)the honour of expecting! I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why,(540,6)so(661,8)_endeavour_ at
civility,(121,7)hus rejected. But it is of small importance.”

“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “(139,13)evident a design
of offending and insulting me, you chose to(932,9)that you liked me
(799,8)your will,(818,9)(935,7)ason(677,6)even(30,14)character?
Was not(927,6)some excuse for in(308,10)if I _was_ u(23,6)? But I have
other provocations. You know(36,7). Ha(700,6)my own(618,9) decided(214,12), had they been indifferent, or(30,10)even been
favourable, do you think(319,6)any consideration(844,7)tempt me to accept
the man who has(129,6)the means of ruining(660,9) for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?”

As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short(496,6)he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continue(960,7)(475,6) every(594,7) i(266,6)world to(354,7)ill of you. No motive can

you cannot deny(786,10)have(417,10)principal, if(728,7)e only(444,6)

disappointed hopes(941,6)involv(159,9)both in misery(126,7) acutest
kind.”

She paused(1010,6)saw with no slight indign(761,6)that he was(554,7)ing
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any(961,8) of remorse.
He(915,6)looked a(612,7)ith a smile of affected incredulity.

“Can you(485,20)done it?” she repeated.

With assumed tranquillity he then replied, (723,8)no wish of denying
that I did(753,6)thing in my pow(455,6)separate my friend(577,6)your
(986,6), or(671,6)I rejoice(70,7)success. Towards _him_ (870,7)been
kinder than t(38,7)myself.”

Elizabeth disdained(527,6)ppearance of notic(736,6)is civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

“But it is not merely(115,6)affair,(424,6)continued, “on(601,7)my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided. Your characte(196,6)unfolded in the recital(736,7)I received
many months ago(470,6)Mr. Wickham. On(337,6)subject, what c(688,7)have to
say? In(29,6)imaginary act of(563,7)ship(57,10)ere defend yourself?
or under(101,6)misrepresent(962,6)(62,13)impose upon others?”

“You take an eager interest(270,6)at gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,
in a less(858,9) tone, and(982,8)heightened colour.

“Who(961,6)knows(302,6)his misfortunes(761,10) can help feeling an
(175,12)him?”

“H(66,14)!” repeate(177,8) contemptuously,--“yes, his

“And(608,7)r infli(825,6)” cried (902,9),(256,6)energy; “Y(520,7)

“is(500,6)opin(138,7)me! This i(42,6)estim(899,6)in(389,11)hold me! I
thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy(675,7)! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping(817,6)s
walk(937,6)turn(98,6)wards her, “these offences might(916,10)
overlooked, had not(789,6)prid(952,7)hurt by my honest confess(459,7)the

Nor am I ashamed(373,7) feelings I related. They were natural and just.

conn(202,6)s?--to congratulate myself o(64,6)hope of(147,6)ions whose
condi(855,8)life is so decidedly beneath my own?”

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angr(349,7) moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak(568,6)composure when she said,--

“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose(761,6)the mode(313,9)declaration affected me in any other way than as it spar(38,6)the
concern which I(962,12)felt in refusing you(967,6)you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.”

She saw him start at this; but (275,7) nothing(836,6)she continue(302,11)could no(947,7)made(201,7) offer(594,8) han(155,6)ny possible way
that would(1014,6)temp(309,7)to accept it.”

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her(506,6)an
expression of mingl(978,6)redulity and mortification. She went on(550,6)From the very beginning, f(25,8)first(669,7), I may almost say, of my

belief(357,9)arrogance(70,7)conceit(450,6)your selfish disdain of the
feelings of(676,6)s, were such as to form(758,6)groundwork of
disapprobation, o(700,8)succeeding events(710,6)built so immovable a
dislike(448,6)I ha(597,6)known you a month before I(781,6)that you(173,6)the

Forgive me for having taken up so much(863,9)time(937,6)(818,7)my best
wishes for(904,7)ealth(153,7)ppiness.”

And(607,9)se words he hastily left the room(593,6)Elizabeth heard him
the nex(765,8) ope(392,6)front door an(340,6) the house. The tumult of
her mind was now painfully great(917,6)knew not how to support herself,
and(917,7)actual weakness, sat down and cried(359,7)lf an hour. Her
astonish(971,6)as she reflect(570,6)what had passed, was increased by
every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from
Mr. Darcy!(902,6)(60,10)(567,9) in love(458,6)her for so many(833,6)s!

(997,6)had made him prevent his friend’s(855,6)ing her sister(793,6)which
must appear at least(650,6)equal force in his own case(357,6)almost
incredible! it was gratifying to(971,6)inspired unconsciously so strong
an aff(222,6). Bu(199,6)pride, his abominable(22,12)shameless avowal

acknowledging, though he could not justify it(1020,6)the unfeeling manner(424,8)(142,6)mentioned Mr. Wickham(223,6)cruelty towards whom(197,8)not
attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity(473,6) the consideration of his
attachmen(823,6)for a moment excited.

sometimes coming there stopp(556,6)(941,6)instead of enter(43,7) park,
she turned up the lane(859,7)l(628,7)farth(402,11) turnpike road. The
park paling was s(813,9)boundary on one side(728,6)she(988,6)passed one

After walking two or three (269,6)along that part (80,7)lane(470,6)was
tempted, by(268,6)leasantness(50,8)(747,7), to stop at(154,11)and

(752,9)(443,9) (828,9)retreating. Bu(412,6)person who advanced was
now near enough to see(804,10)stepping forward with eagerness,
pronounc(785,7)nam(986,7)had(832,8)away; but on hear(341,7)self called,
though in a voic(875,8)proved it to be(1002,10)(693,6)moved again

a letter,(678,11)instinctively took, said,(274,6)a look of haughty
composure, “I have been(930,9)(708,7)grove som(935,6),(732,8)hope of

then(168,9)slight bow,(416,9)gain(944,11)lantation(858,6)was soon
out of sight.

With no expec(49,6) of plea(248,6)but(560,6)the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth open(787,7)(381,8)and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of(472,7) paper, written
quite through,(643,7)ery close hand. The(97,10)itself was likewise
full. Pursu(736,7) way along(216,6)ane(943,6)then began it. It(961,6)ated
from Rosings, at eight o’clock(567,8)morning(417,10)as follows:--

“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiv(554,6)is(747,9)by the apprehens(462,6)

your at(361,7); your feel(659,6)I know, will bestow it unwillingly(1018,6)I
(80,6) it of(70,6)justice.

“Two offences of(883,8)different nature(738,6)by no means of equal

it was not till(402,6)vening(398,7) dance at Netherfield(300,8)had any

information(378,14)’s atten(744,6)(587,7)(378,8)had given rise to
a general expect(743,12)ir marriage. He spoke of it as a certain
event, of(1009,7)the time alone c(628,8)undecided. From(720,6)moment I
observed my friend’s behaviour(214,8)vely; and I(89,7)then perceive
that his partiality for Miss Benne(593,6)beyond w(551,10)ever witnessed

cheerful(908,6)engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar

acute (846,7)r a(555,6)ction that, however amiable her temper, her heart

her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say(289,6)my
investiga(677,6)and decis(14,6)r(607,6)usually influenced by my hopes or
fears. I(723,9)(160,6)(250,7)o be(164,13)because I wished it; I
(53,7)d it on impartial(353,11), as truly as(64,12) in (549,6).
My objec(889,6)to(443,6)arriage we(215,7)merely those which I last night
ac(790,9)d to(879,6)required the utmost force of passion to put aside
in my own case; the want of conn(168,6) coul(316,8) so great an evil to
my friend as to m(779,7)ther(214,7)other causes of repugnance;(22,7)
which, though still existing, and(14,9) to an equal degree in both
instances, I had myself endeavour(306,6)forget,(496,9)they(384,9)
immediately before me. These(197,8)mus(273,6)tated(184,9)briefly. The

any share(108,7) like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on
you (216,9)eldest(386,7) than it is honourable to the sense and

inducement heightened, which could(345,6)led me(865,8)to preserve my
friend(157,11)I esteemed a most unhappy conn(829,6). He left
Netherfield for London on(608,6)ay following, as you, I am certain,
remember, with(664,7)sign of soon returning. The part(230,7)I acted is
now to be explained. His(860,8)’ uneasiness had been equ(871,6)xcited
with my own: (819,6)incidence of feeling was(156,6)discovered; and, alike
sensible(739,6)no time w(716,6)be lost in detaching their bro(563,6)we
shortly resolved on joining him directly in(376,7). We accordingly
went--and there I readily engaged i(426,6)offi(226,6)pointing out to(548,11)the(438,8) evils of such a choice. I described(682,6)nforced them
earnestly. But however this remonstrance might(702,6)staggered or delayed
his determination, I do not suppos(378,7)it would ultimately have
prevent(154,6) marriage, had it not(545,6)seconded by the assurance(873,7)
I hesitated not in giving, of your(642,7)’s indifference. He(648,7)fore

him against(270,7)ing into Hertfordshire, when(874,6)convi(300,6)(996,8)

done, however, and(324,8)done for the best. On(103,6)subject I have
nothing more to say, no (357,6)apology to offer. If(58,7) wounded your

hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreat(877,6)for

CHAPTER XXXVI.(36,19)Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave he(751,6)(200,6), di(995,6)expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no(64,7)ation at all of
its contents(962,6)such as they were, it(443,8)well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrarie(499,6)emotion(104,6)excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarce(971,6)be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apolog(84,8)in his power;
and steadfastly w(147,7)persuaded,(84,9)could have(366,7)lan(366,6)to
give, which a just sen(651,6)shame woul(489,6)conceal(214,8) strong
prejudice against everything he might say(509,6)bega(203,6)account of
what had happened at Netherfield. S(368,9)ith an(480,6)ness(190,6)
hardly left her(297,6)(963,6)mprehensio(1019,6) from impatience of knowing(138,6)the next sentenc(197,8)bring, was incapable of attending to the
(324,9)the one befor(836,6)eyes. His(494,6)f of her sister’s
insensibility she instantly resolved(617,7)false(212,6)(338,14) the
real, the worst objections(168,7) match, mad(992,7)oo angry to(563,6)any
wish of doing him justice. He express(973,6)regret for(862,6)(1006,7)done

pride and insolence.

But when this subjec(52,6)succeeded by(296,16)Mr. Wickham--when
(986,8),(619,6)somewhat clearer(493,6)tion, a rel(844,6)of event(655,7),
if true, must overthrow(797,6) cherished opin(65,7)his worth, and(728,7)bore so alarming an affinit(422,6)is own history(72,6)mself--her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and(25,6)difficult of definition.
Astonishment, ap(853,10)(175,6)even horror, op(533,8)her(958,6)wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This(326,6)(754,8)!

was unfolded(160,6); and collecting herself as well as she(145,6), she
again began the mortifying perusal of all(320,6)related to(964,8), and
command(638,6)self so far as to examin(552,6)mean(457,7)(922,6)sentence.
The account(926,8)connection(346,8)e Pemberley family was exactly

own words. S(273,6)each recital confirme(150,6)other(521,6)(819,9)came to
the will, the difference was great. What(407,8) had said(227,9)iving
was fresh in her memory(570,6)(543,7)recalled his very(195,6), it was
impossible not to fee(545,7)ther(149,8)oss duplicity on one sid(948,6)he

not err. B(316,12)read and re-rea(925,10)e closest attention, the
particulars immediately follow(694,7)(761,7)’s resigning all pretensions
to(373,11),(717,8)receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds,(999,6) w(968,7)forc(909,6)hesitate. She put down the
letter, weighed(885,7)circumstance(858,6)what s(929,7)t to be

little success. On both sides(601,7) only assertion. Agai(459,11)on.
But(194,7)line proved more clearly(648,9) affair, whic(973,9)
believed it (714,11)that any contrivance could so represent as to
render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn(158,7)must make him entirely blame(76,7)roughou(220,6)whole.

She tried to recollect some instance of goodness,(27,6)distinguished
trait(188,6)tegrity or benevolence, that might rescu(948,6)from the
attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by(205,6)redomin(153,8)(201,6), atone
for those casual errors, under(978,7)she would endeavour to class what
(132,9) had described as the idleness and vi(290,6)many years’

designs on Miss(630,6), received(773,6)confi(972,8)from what had passed
between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself onl(707,6)morning(468,7);(442,6)t

She perfectly (967,8)ed(1024,6)thing t(655,14) in conversation(671,9)Wickh(659,15)in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.
Many(531,8)expressions were still fresh in her memory. S(719,7)_now_

(387,12)then no reserves, no scruples in sink(392,13)’s
character, though(328,9)(970,7)her(906,6)respect for the father would
always prevent(846,8)os(968,6)e son.

How differently di(1009,13)now appear in which (871,7)concerned! His
atten(840,9)Miss King(950,6)no(799,6)consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary;(798,9)mediocri(961,6)her fortune proved no longer
the moderation(842,8)wishes(706,6)his eagerness to grasp at an(252,6).
His behaviour to (548,7) could now hav(969,6)no tolerable motive:(997,7)
either(564,6)deceived with regard(91,7)(207,8), or(613,10)gratifying
his vanity by encourag(464,8)preference(424,7)she believed s(908,7)most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and(12,8)(423,6)in further justific(386,9)(739,9), s(925,6)ld not
but allow(994,6)Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago

as(891,12) was incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither(1013,6) nor(486,8)
(1020,6)she think, without(364,8)(479,14)been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.

“How despicab(322,8)I acted!” she cried. “I, who(356,6)prided myself on
my discernment! (45,12)(701,6)(45,10) my abilities!(85,9)
(661,6)disdain(522,6) generous candour of my (657,6)(1012,7)ratified my

discovery! Yet, how just a(47,10)on! Had I(715,6)in love, I(654,7)not

folly. Pleased with the preference of one(993,6)offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I(848,6)courted
prepossession and ignor(44,6)and driven reason away where (726,7)were
concerned. Till this moment, I never knew(605,7).”

From(808,8) to Jane,(985,6)Jane to(900,8), her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection(843,6)Mr.(903,6)’s explanation
_there_ had appeared(334,6)insufficient; an(943,6)read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal(684,6)(602,6)she deny that
credi(196,6)is assertions, in one ins(460,7)(251,7)he had(695,6)obliged to

Charlotte’s opinion(366,6)lway(798,6). N(596,7)(279,17)e justice
of his description of Jane. She felt(492,6)Jane’s feelings,(577,7)
fervent,(584,6)little displayed(886,6)that there was a constant

CHAPTER XXXVII.(64,16)]

T(528,17)left(528,9)the next morning(772,6)Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodg(531,7)make(473,6)h(181,20), was
able to b(633,6)ome the pleasing intelligence of their(879,10) in very
good health(881,6)in as tolerable spirits as(527,10)expected,(565,7)the
melancholy scene so l(856,6)gone through a(310,9). To(850,10)e then
hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter(365,6)on his(747,7)
brought back,(811,6)great satisfaction, a message(991,6)her Ladyship,
impo(561,6)that she felt herself so dull(303,6)(438,6)her very desirous of
(507,6)(939,7)ll to dine(961,6)her.

(857,16)not se(250,17)without recollec(157,9), had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been present(365,6)her as her
future niece; nor(1007,7)she(887,6)(338,6)out a smile, of what her
(323,8)’s indignation would(127,10). “What(23,7)sh(154,7)said? how
(25,15)behaved?” wer(750,6)questions(482,6)which she amused
(426,7).

Their first subject wa(953,6)diminution(809,7)(983,8)’ party. “I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,” said(685,15); “I believe nobody
feel(122,6)loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attach(804,6)these young men(780,6)know(624,6)to be(88,10)(57,11)me!
They(334,6)excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear
Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seem(1010,6)(344,8)most acutely--more, I(636,8)than last year. His(275,7)ment to(448,8) certainly increases.”

Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion(356,6)row in here,(615,6)
were kindly(772,6)d on(874,6)e mother and daughter.

(974,15)observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet (288,7)out of

she did not like(496,6) home again so soon,(849,6)dded,--

“But if(166,6)i(834,6)case, you must write to your(268,8)to be(125,6) you

company,(801,6)sure.”

“I am(838,6)oblig(806,6)your Ladyship for(155,6)kind invitation,” replied
Elizabeth; “but it is not in my pow(212,6)accept it. I(254,6)be in town
next Saturday.”

“Why, at(484,6)rat(311,7)will have bee(616,6) only six weeks. I expected
you to(319,6)two months. I told(321,14)so before you cam(957,6)re

“Oh,(653,6)(130,6), of course, may (196,9), i(607,6)(963,8)can.
D(964,7)s are never of so(617,6)consequence to a(232,7). And(80,7) will

“Y(33,7)all kindness, madam; but I believe we(955,6)abide by our
original plan.”

Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “(888,12)(984,6)must send a servant
with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I(816,7) bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.

world(569,6)at sort of thing. Y(166,11)(510,7)(241,7)be (137,6)ly
guarded and attended, according(662,7)ir situation in life. When my
niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
having two men-(441,7)s go with her. Miss Darcy, the daught(649,6)Mr.
Darcy of Pemberley(463,6)Lady Anne, c(747,9)have appeared with
propriety in a different manner.(1006,6)excessively(307,6)t(449,7)all those
things(621,6)(656,10)John(206,6)the(582,7)ladies, (712,12)(104,6)

discreditable to _you_ to let them go alon(954,6)My uncle is(652,9)(832,9) for us.”

“Oh! Your(47,6)! He keeps a ma(441,9), does he?(308,6)very glad you
have(746,9) who thinks(702,6)ose(708,6)s. Where shall you change horses?
Oh, Bromley, of course. If you(296,9)my name at the Bell, you will be
(762,8) to.”

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting(812,7)journey;
and as she di(631,6)answer(386,6)all herself(586,8)on was
necessary--which Elizabeth believ(527,6)be lucky for her; or,(817,6)a
mind so occupied, she migh(765,7)forgotten w(359,7)e was. Reflection
must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever(66,8)(600,6)(112,6)gave
way to it as the greatest relief; an(287,7) day went by without a
(115,9)walk, in (280,6)(211,10)indulge in(905,7)e delight of
unpleasant recol(224,7)s.

Mr. Darcy’s lett(200,11)in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
studied every sentence(218,6)her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
(390,8)still full of indignation: but w(85,8)considered how unjustly
sh(764,6)condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against

His attachment excited gratitude, his general character(922,8)(240,6)she
coul(904,7)pprove him; nor (27,6)she for a moment repent her refusal, or
fee(612,6)slightest incli(353,6) ever to see him(273,6). In her own past
behaviour, ther(829,7) constant source of vex(90,6)and regret: and in
the unhappy defects of(629,6)amily, a su(346,9)yet heavier chagrin.
They(648,6)hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, w(357,6)ever exert himself to restrain the wild giddin(113,7)his
youngest daughters(838,10)mo(133,6)with manners so far from righ(633,9), was entirely insensib(820,6)the evil. Elizabeth had frequently

and Lydia;(888,7)ile t(368,9)supported by thei(230,8)’s indulgence,

Anxiety on Jane’s behalf(166,7)other prevailing concern(740,6)Mr. Darcy’s
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all(1002,6)ormer good opinion,
heightened the sense of what(721,6)had lost. His affecti(266,7)proved to

respect, so replete(1000,6)advantage, so promising for happiness,(318,9)

character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom(1002,6)depressed before(907,6)now so much(553,7)ed as to make it
almost impossible(310,6)er to appear tolerably cheerful.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.(74,16)]

On Saturday(373,8) Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
(688,6)s(977,8)the others(919,7)ed(756,8) took(578,6)pportun(614,6)
pay(886,8)parting civilities which he deemed indispensably(687,7)ary.

“I know not,(400,6)(207,9),” said he, “whether Mrs(224,10)has yet
express(443,6) sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
certain you will not le(938,7) house without receiving(744,6)hanks for
it. The favour(133,9)company has been much felt, I assure you. We know
how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms(943,6)few domestic(19,7)the(125,8)we
see(1000,8)world, must make(864,10)extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself(379,8)hope(368,10)believe us grateful for the condescension,
(164,6)at we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending
your time unpleasantly.”

(850,10)was eager with(494,12)and(441,6)ances of happiness. She had
spent six weeks(69,6)great enjoyment(875,6)the pleasure of being with
Charlotte(413,10)kind attention s(111,6)(663,7)e(418,13)_her_ feel
the obliged. Mr(840,10)wa(372,6)ifi(1019,8)with a more smiling
solemnity replied,--

“It gives m(811,6)greatest(208,10)to hear(436,6)you(437,6)passed your
time not disagreeably. W(480,7)(925,7)ly(490,6)our bes(315,7)most
fortunately having it(520,17)introduc(631,6)to very superior

with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed(211,6)sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on
what a footing we are(34,10)how continually(32,7) engaged there. In
truth, I(730,6)acknowledge, that,(689,7)ll the dis(176,9)s of this
(398,7)parsonage, I should not(408,7)anyone abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at(566,8).”

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings(923,6)he was
(970,7) to walk about the room(155,8)Elizabeth tri(46,6)unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

“You may, in fact, carry a(835,6)favourable rep(577,6) us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I(773,9)myself, at least(476,6) you will
be able to do so.(724,18)great attentions to Mrs. Collins you

as well to be silent. Only let me assure you(320,10)Miss(480,10),(142,6)I can from my heart most cordi(868,6)ish you equal felicity in
marriage. M(421,7)Charlott(1015,6)I (315,6)ut one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in everything a(144,6)remark(562,7)semblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to(142,7)een designed for each
other.”

(771,10)could safely say(607,6)it was a(572,7)happiness where(643,6)was
the case, and with(322,7)sincerity(97,7)add(698,7)she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. S(999,6) not sorry, however, to(707,6)the recital of them interrupted by the entr(349,7) the lady from
whom they sprang. Poo(501,11)!(285,8)melancholy to leave her to such
society! Bu(246,6)had chosen(745,6)th her eyes open(871,6)though evidently
regretting(1019,6)her visitors were to go, she did(287,6)(526,7)ask for
compassion. Her hom(703,6)her housekeeping, her parish(33,9)poultry,
and all their dependent concerns, ha(129,6)yet lost(43,7)charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunk(218,7)fastened on(29,6)parcels

her in, Maria followed(432,6)the door was o(379,6)point of being closed,

“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble(525,9)
deliver(651,9)(258,8)your grateful(525,7)(205,8)ir(527,10)to you
while you(107,6)been here.”

(763,10)made no obj(823,6):(442,14)then a(473,6)(882,7)shut, and
(808,13)drove off.

“Good gracious!” cried(552,6), a(940,6) few minutes’ silence, “it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!”

“A great(38,6)indeed,” said her companion(626,7)a sigh.

“We(431,6)dined nine times at(572,8), besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall(516,6)to tell!(407,13)privately(587,9)And(227,6)(65,20)conceal!”

Their journey was performed without(133,6)convers(843,7)or any alarm; and
within four hours of(619,7)leaving Hunsford(900,6)reached Mr. Gardiner’s
house, w(266,6)hey were to remain(521,7)days.

Jane looked well, and (688,10)had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the(831,10)of her aunt
had reserved(875,8)m. But Jane(802,6)o go home(935,6)her(181,6)at
Longbourn(521,7)would be leisure enough for observation.

It was not(438,9)an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for(128,10), before she tol(754,6)sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know

further.

CHAPTER XXXIX.(75,16)](743,9)the second week in May, (345,9)the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street(956,8) town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
and, (145,6)y drew nea(59,6)appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was
to meet them,(79,6)quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.
These two girls had(810,8)ove an hour i(603,6)place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching(461,7)ntinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.

After welcom(75,7)i(660,8)s(327,7)triumphantly displayed a table set
out with(1012,6)cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
“Is not this nice? i(18,11)an agree(118,6)urprise?”

“And we mean to treat you all,” adde(452,7); “bu(28,6)must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at(826,6)hop out there.” Then showing
her purchases,--“Look here, I(88,6)bough(233,7)bonnet. I do(255,8)nk it
is very pretty; but I th(61,6)I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better.”

And when he(556,9) abused(130,7)ugly, she(380,6),(541,6)perfect
unconcern, “Oh, b(330,8) wer(826,6)or three much uglie(818,9)shop; and

“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth(367,7)the greatest satisfaction.

“They (104,10)to be encamped near Brighton; and(671,6)so want papa to
take us all(450,7)fo(233,6)(251,6)! It would be such a delicious scheme,

“Now(874,8)go(871,7)news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down(557,6)ble. “What do you(407,6)? It is excellent news, capital(14,7)and about
a certain person that we all like.”

Jane an(791,11) looked at each other(255,10)waiter was told(85,6)he
need not stay.(225,6) laughed(948,6)said,--

As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid(165,7)arriage was
ordered; and, after some contrivance(220,6)whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags(129,6)parcel(13,7)the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and
Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.

“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. (658,6)glad I brought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having an(433,6)band-box! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug(402,7)alk and laug(319,9) way

With(934,6)kind of histories(255,7)ir parties and(971,6)jokes did Lydia,
assisted by(951,6)’s hint(52,6)additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as(984,8)as she
could(654,6)there was no escaping the frequent mention of(534,8)’s name.

was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account(803,7) present

“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us(616,6)we had such fun!

To this(699,6)(417,6)gravely replied, “Far be it(993,6)me, my dear sister,
to depreciate(718,6)(843,9). They(819,7)doubtless be congenial(491,9)
generality of female minds. But I confess t(85,10)have no charms for

But(1006,6)is answer Lydia(311,7)not a word. She seldom listened to

in(534,7)her sister was concerned(906,6)preparing her to be surprised,
she relat(936,6)her the next morning the chief(915,8)scene(584,9)Mr.
Darcy and herself.

Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by(596,6)trong(207,7)ly
partiality(771,7)made any admi(446,6) of(703,11)appear perfectly
natural(358,7)ll(254,9)(134,6)hortly lost in other feelings. She was

little sui(371,7)recommend them(823,6)still mor(165,8)e grieved for the
unhappiness(520,17)’s refusal must(161,6)given him.

“His being so sure(812,15)was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
ought not to(261,6)(381,6)ed(1021,6)consider how much it(145,6)increase his
disappointment.”

“Indeed,” replied(480,10), “I am heartily (409,6)for hi(318,7)he has
(459,14)(813,7)will probably(644,6)drive away his regar(360,6)me.
You do not blame me, however, for(363,6)ing him?”

“Blame you! Oh, no.”

“But you(70,9)(180,6)aving spoken so warmly of Wickha(82,6)No--I(135,8)know(650,6)you were(427,6) in saying w(30,8)did(125,13)_will_(67,6)it, when I(706,6)told(83,6)hat happened the very
next day.”

She then(186,6) of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George(255,8). What a strok(948,6)this for poor Jane,
who would willingly(759,7)one through(143,6)orld without believ(171,6)at
so(681,6)wickedness existed in(206,11)race of mankind as was here
collec(51,7)one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though
grateful to (707,12), capab(333,6)consoling(35,6)or such discovery.
Most earnestly d(966,6) labour to prove the(785,7)ility of error, and
seek to clear one,(315,9)invol(315,7)e other.

“This(871,6)not do,” sai(963,11); “you never(912,6)be able to make both
(596,6)m goo(910,6)anything. Take your choice, b(861,7)must be satisfied
with only one. There is but(306,6)a quant(251,7)merit between them; just
en(578,6)(163,7)one(154,6)sort(522,7); and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to(672,7)e it all Mr.
(571,7)(245,10)shall do as you choose.”

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

“I do not know when I(864,6)been more shocked(496,8)she. “(967,7) so
very bad! It is almost pas(903,7)f. And(982,6)Mr.(804,6)! dear Lizzy,

thing of his sister(220,8)really too distressing(480,7)sure(686,9)

“Oh no, my regret and compassion are (495,6)ne away by seeing(525,6)o full
of both. I(436,6)you(918,6)do him(764,7)mple justice, that(643,6)growing
every moment(486,6)unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me
saving(800,6)if you lament over him much longer, my heart(178,6)be as
light as a feather.”

“Poor (614,7)! t(991,8)(987,6)n expre(314,6)of goodness in his
countenance!(51,9)openness and gentle(52,11) mann(124,7)There certainly(876,10)great mismanagement in the educat(144,7)those
two young men. One has go(1012,6)the(185,9), and the other(32,8)
appearance of it.”

“I never thought(852,10) so defici(153,11)_(68,10)_(69,6) as you
used to d(674,6)And yet I meant to b(536,6)mm(928,6)lever in taking(111,6)cided(914,6)like

opening for wit, to have(106,10)(361,6)at kind(351,6)may be continually
abusive(143,9)saying any(999,6)just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man(216,9)now(437,8)n stumbling on some(93,6)witty.”

“Lizzy, when you first read(926,6)letter,(934,6)sure you could not treat
the matter(452,7) do now(535,6)ndeed, I(55,10). I was(453,6)fortable enough,(28,7)very
(33,13)--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I
felt, no Ja(36,6)(120,7) me(739,6)say(437,6)I ha(219,6)been so very weak,
and vain(791,6)nonsensical, as I knew(66,6)! Oh, how I wanted you!”

“How unfortunate(556,6)you should(590,6)used(657,6)very strong expressions
in(233,6)ing of Wickham to(888,10), for now they _do_ (954,6) wholly
undeserved.”

“Certainly. But the mis(171,6)e of(114,10)with bitterness is a most
natural consequenc(786,7)e prejudices(359,7)been encouraging. There is
one point on which(330,7) your advice(584,6)nt to be told whether I
ought, or ought no(943,6)make our acquaintance in general understand
(343,7)’s character.”

Miss Bennet paused a littl(592,7)then replied, “Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is(252,6)own opinion?”

“That it(230,10)(271,7)attempted.(531,10) has not authorized me to
make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was me(421,10)kept as much as possibl(132,6)yself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me? The(488,9)(656,9) against(296,11)is
so violent,(933,6)it would be the death of hal(738,6)good(158,8)in
Meryton, to(398,8) to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to
it.(993,9)will soon be gone; and,(604,6)fore, it(248,6)not signify to
anybody here what he really is. Some time hence(71,9)be all found
out(738,11)we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.
At present I(212,7)ay nothing about it.”

“You are quite r(293,6)To hav(690,6)errors made(688,7) might ruin him for
ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for(278,9)has don(973,7)anxious to
re-establish a character. We mus(896,6)(844,7)m desperate.”

The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by t(908,6)nversation. She
had got rid of two o(636,6)secrets which had weighed on her for a
fortnigh(455,7)was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she
(353,6)wish to talk(837,6) of either. But(663,6) was st(698,6)mething
lurking behind, of(187,7)prudence forbad(876,7)isclosure. She dared not
relat(913,6)other(910,6)of(973,10)’s letter, nor explain to her sister
how sincerely she had been valu(405,6)his friend. H(217,8)knowledge in
(382,6)no one could partak(936,6) sh(270,7)ensible that(760,9)less than
a perfect understand(302,6)tween the parties(103,7)justify her in
thr(885,6)off(589,6)last encumbrance of mystery. “A(980,7),” said she, “if
that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall m(333,6)be
able to tell(870,6)Bingley may(22,6)in a much more agreeable manner
himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost
all its(468,6)!”

S(401,7)now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observ(666,6)real
state of(594,11)’s spirits. Jan(102,8)t happy(710,6)(788,6)cherished a
very tender affection for(305,8). Having (908,6)even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadin(698,8)(76,17)s often

feelings(438,8)(984,6)s, were requisite to check the indulge(830,7)those
regrets (1019,6)must have been injurious to her own health a(883,6)ir
tranquillity.

“Well, Lizzy(912,8)Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad bus(419,6)of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined(606,7)to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my(757,7) Philips so the(422,7)day. But I
(928,7)find out(444,6)Jane saw anything of him in London. (275,6)he is(807,8)undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least
chance in(781,6)orld(962,8)ever getting him now. T(68,8)no talk(166,6)s

“(286,9)believe(834,6)he will(253,6)live at(210,14)ny more.”

“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants(958,7) come; though I

her, I would no(898,7)put up with it(580,8)my comfort is(762,7)sure

But as Elizabeth c(162,9)receive(140,9)from any such expectation she
made no answer.

“(785,6)Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and(924,7)
Collinses(493,6)ver(281,9)able, do they?(892,7)well, I only hope it

CHAPTER XLI.(116,16)]

The first week of(726,7)return was soon gone. The second began. (526,6)
the last(65,7)(180,9)’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apac(136,7)dejectio(165,6)almost
universal(172,6)elder Miss Bennets alone(86,6)still able to eat, drink,
and sleep(174,6)pursue the usual course(302,10)employments. Very
frequently(194,6)they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme(334,6)who(891,11)comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any(427,8)family.

“Good Heaven! W(792,7)to become of us?(25,6)are we to do?”(977,7)(926,11)exclaim in(825,6)itterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?”

Their aff(490,6)ate mother share(584,9)ir grief; she remembered what
she had herself endur(908,6)a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.

“I am sure,” said she, “I cri(470,8)wo days together w(983,11)
(983,27). I thought I should have broke my heart.”(138,12) I shall break _mine_(159,8)Lydia.

“If one(550,7)but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs.(815,7).

“Oh yes!--i(67,31) But papa is so disagreeable.”

“A little sea-bathing(571,7)set me up for ever(50,6)nd my aunt Philips is(247,6)it(631,7)do _me_ a great deal of good,”
added(854,6).

Such(914,9) kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried(818,6) diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s
obj(797,6)s; and never had she before been so much dispos(169,6)pardon his
interference(952,8)views of his friend.

But the gloom of(614,6)’s prospect was shortly cle(939,6)way; for she
received an invi(381,6) from(641,6)Forster, the wife of the c(841,6)(15,7)
(839,8), to accompany her(736,12). This invaluable(206,7) was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resembla(296,7)good-humour
and good spirits had recommended her an(920,7) to each other(116,6)out of
their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had(477,6)intimate _two_.

The rapture(419,9) on this occasion,(145,6)dor(383,6)of(381,14)
the delight(29,9)Bennet(291,6)the mortific(67,9)Kitty, are scarcely
(789,7)escribed. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings,(303,7)flew
abo(639,7)house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s
congratul(1002,6)(486,6)laughing(208,6)alking with more viole(368,6)an ever;
whils(772,6)luckless(245,6) continued(834,8)parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as(554,6)ccen(846,6)peevish.

“I cannot see why(816,13) should not ask _me_ as well as(939,6),”
said she, “though I am _not_ her particular(1017,8) I have just as much
right (478,6)asked as she ha(352,7)more too, for(102,6)two years older.”

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her (295,10)(934,6)Jane(33,8)
(33,6)signed. As for(80,11)herself,(774,6)invit(761,6)was so far from
exciting in her the same(660,9) as(28,8)mot(983,13), that she
considered it as (848,6)ath-warrant of all possibility of common sense
fo(129,6)latter; and detest(557,8)such a step must(302,9), were it
known, she c(546,9)help secretly advising(673,8)her not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of(957,6)’s general
behaviour,(834,6)ittle advantage(163,11)derive from the(649,7)ship of

imprudent(1014,6)(332,7)companion at Brighton, where the temp(574,6)s must
be greater than at home. He heard(980,6)ttentively(165,9)n said,--

“Lydia will never be easy till(858,8) exposed(721,8) in some public
place or oth(269,8)we can(85,7)expect(731,6)o do i(254,8)o(401,7)
expense or inconvenience to(545,7)mily as und(803,7)(533,7)
circumstances.”

“If you(654,6)aware,” sa(1005,12), “of the very(331,6) dis(537,10)to

would judge differently in the affair.”

“A(80,13)!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has s(753,6)ghtened away
some of your lovers? Poor(838,8)Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as can(46,6)ar to be connected(791,6)a(937,9)bsurdity

Mr. Bennet saw(862,10)whole heart was(624,7) subject(533,6)
affectionately ta(973,9)hand, said, in reply,--

“Do not make you(760,6)uneasy, my love. W(410,8)you and Jane(253,11)

there may teach(674,6)er own insignificance. At(315,6)ate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life.”

With this answer Elizabeth was forced(418,7)content; bu(937,6)own opinion
continued(940,6)ame(545,6)she left him disappoin(817,8)sorry. I(1001,6)not

She was confident of(873,8)performed her duty(946,6)to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety,(191,7) par(106,6)er

say(185,14)(430,9)?”

“Nearly(464,6) weeks.”

“And you saw him frequently?”

“Yes, almost every day.”

“His(660,7)s ar(892,7)(188,8)(755,9)s cousin’(110,6)Yes,(42,15); but I think(653,10) improves on(596,9)ance.”

may I ask--” but checking himself, he(371,8)in a gayer tone, “Is it in

CHAPTER XLII.(67,16)]

Had (887,9)’s opinion been all drawn(554,6)her own(662,7), she could
not have formed a very pleasing pictu(907,6)conjugal(562,11)r domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beau(1022,8)that appearance
of good-humour(522,7)(59,16) generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had(250,6)(1012,6)in
their(84,6)age put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
esteem(230,6)confidence(107,6)anished for ever; and all his views of
(351,8) (701,10)were overthrown. But Mr. (1015,11)not of a

console the unfortunate(129,8)ir folly (15,9)vice. He was fond of
t(692,6)ntry and of books(314,6)from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife h(112,6)very little otherwise indebted than as
her ignorance(131,6)olly had contributed t(98,6)amusement. This is not
the sort of(483,12)hich a man would in(754,8) wish to owe(93,7)
wife; but wher(183,7) powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit(353,6)such as are given.

Elizabeth, however(910,6)never been bli(823,6)the impropriety of her
father’s behaviour as a husband. Sh(823,6)always seen it with pain; but
r(889,6)ing(371,6)bilities(898,6)grateful(937,6)is(955,10)ate trea(768,6)of
herself, she endeavour(461,6)forget what s(659,6)ld(881,6)verlook(1009,6)to
banish(667,6)her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum(924,6), in expos(234,8)wife(351,8)contemp(594,6)er own
children, was so highly reprehensible. Bu(211,6)(446,10)felt so
strongly as now the disadvantag(1012,9)must attend(141,6)(121,7) of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor (557,10)so fully aware of the evils arising

might at least have preserve(194,6)(596,7)(588,6)(689,6)is daughters, even
if incapable(881,6)larging the mind(58,8)wife.

When (826,9) had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure(655,6)found little
(1001,6)cause for satisfa(262,6)in the loss(326,8)regiment. Their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home(551,9)a m(132,6)and
sister, whose constant repinings at(570,6)ulne(149,6)everything around
them threw a real gloom(278,6)their domestic circl(154,6),(862,7) Kitty(473,7)in time regain her natural degree of sense, since(729,8)turbers

greater evil (625,6)be ap(891,6)ded(918,6)likely to be hardened in all her
folly(389,6)ssurance, by a situa(761,8)such double danger as a
watering-place(461,6) camp. Upo(555,6)whole, therefo(626,13), what
has(934,8)metimes(657,7)(549,6), that an event to(888,6)(560,9)looked
forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the
(751,13)(659,8)promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some(466,7)period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
(67,12)oint on(256,7)her wishes and hopes(525,10)fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console(237,8)(180,8)
present(85,6)prepare for an(945,6)disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object (788,7)happiest(888,7)ts: i(360,6)her best(156,7)ation
for(439,8) uncomfortable hours(551,7)(895,7)contentedness(113,8)mother
and(996,6) made inevitable; and could(623,7)ve included Jane in(567,6)cheme, every part of it would(57,6)been perfect.

“But it is fortunate,”(252,8) she, “that I(121,6)something to wish for.
Were(875,10) arrang(601,6)complete, my(414,15)(153,7)be certain.
But here, by carrying(848,6)me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope(734,8) all my expectations of
(668,9)realized. A (355,6) of(1024,7)(363,11)(928,7)s delight can
never be successful(464,6)general(273,16)is only warded off by
the defen(238,6)some little peculiar vexation.”

When Lydia went away she(164,8)d to write very often and(15,6)minutely
to(674,11) (674,9); b(422,6) letters were always long(333,7)(1021,7)
(26,7)very short. Thos(387,6)(97,10)contained(221,8)else than that
they(107,6)just returned from the library, where such and(9,6)officers
had attended them, and(52,8)he had seen(65,6)beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that(67,9)a new gown, or(15,7)parasol,(576,6)
she(926,12)described more fully, but was oblig(445,6)leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her(235,6)(329,10)go(971,7)the
camp(670,6)from (403,6)rrespondence(904,6)her (868,6) there was still less
to be learnt, for(555,13)to(581,6), though rather longer,(587,6)much
too full of lines und(117,6) words (106,6)made public.

Af(153,7) first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,
good-humou(302,7)cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything
wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town fo(229,7)inter
came back again(686,6)summer finery(18,12)engage(679,7)rose. Mrs.
Benne(584,6)restor(585,6)her usual querulous serenity(524,6)by the middle
of June(452,6)(506,6)o much recovered a(410,8)able to enter Meryton
without tears,--an event of(947,6)happy promise(78,7)make Elizabeth
hope,(879,6)(160,7)following Christmas she might be so tolerably
reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by
some cruel and malicious arran(389,6) at the War Office, another regiment
should be quartered in(305,8).

The time fixed(545,9)beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching(998,6)a(797,12)nl(463,6)want(82,7)it, when a(958,7)
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at(302,6)delayed its commenc(272,7)nd
curtail(31,7)extent. Mr(79,10) w(274,8)prevented by business from
set(171,6)ut till(209,13)later in July(969,6)must be in London(849,6)
within a month(284,7)s(606,6)left too short a perio(387,9)m to go so
far(923,7)ee(789,9)as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort(70,10)built on,(89,6)were oblig(976,6)give up
the Lakes(148,7)ubstitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan,(110,6)(242,6)no farthe(628,7)ward than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occup(975,6)chief(727,10)three
weeks(700,6)to(640,14) it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life(583,6)where
(382,10)now to spe(852,6)ew days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all(256,6)elebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, (661,6) Peak.

Elizabeth(370,6)xcessively disappointed:(261,9)set her heart on seeing(588,10)(795,6)still thought(467,7)might have been time(484,7). But it
was her(965,10)(509,7)atisfied--and certainly her temper(551,7)happy;
and all was soon right(972,6).

With the mention of(659,11),(644,8)ere many ideas connected. It was
impossible for(142,6)(940,6)the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his (812,7)with impunity,
and rob it of(615,7)petrified spars,(145,9)his perceiving me.”

The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks(1011,9)pass away
before her uncle and aunt’s arrival(500,6)they did(60,10)(833,6)Mr. and
(961,13)(189,6)(1007,7)four children, did at length appear at

younger boys,(241,9)be left unde(855,6)particular care of(175,7)cousin
Jane, who was the general favourite(257,6)whose steady sense and
sweetness of(762,8)exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing(356,9)m(394,6)lov(36,8).(545,6)(399,8)s stayed only one n(870,6)t (374,9)(462,6)set off the next
morn(108,9)Elizabeth in pursu(705,6)novelt(805,6)amusement. One
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
(30,13)which comprehended health(507,6)(354,6)to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance(357,6) pleasure--and affection
and intelligence,(133,7)might supply it amo(413,7)selves if there were
disappointments abroad.

It is not the object(649,6)is work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any(710,7) remarkable places through(326,7)(921,6)route thither
lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are

asked by her(396,6); and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds

Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece(646,8)smile(857,6)(615,10)could not

“In(186,6)an amiable light(71,6)this place him!” thought (924,9).

Mrs. Reynolds anticipated(192,11)’s delight(166,6) she should enter

The picture gallery, and two or thre(305,9)principal bed-rooms, were

bu(1023,11) knew(196,9)(436,7)art(661,6)from such as had been already

sensation towards(525,6)riginal than(841,9)ever felt i(987,6)height of
their acquaintance. The commend(98,6)bestow(639,6)him by(277,14)
was of no trifling nature. What praise is(881,6)valuable(166,6)the(33,7)
of an(885,9)ent servant? As a brother, a landlor(280,6)aster, she
considered how(920,6)people’s happiness(949,6)(422,6) guardianship! How
much of pleasure or pain it was(57,8)power to(289,7)! How (60,8)good
or evil must be done by him! Every idea(583,6)(580,9)brought forward by
the housekeeper was favour(329,6)o his character; and(893,8)(831,6)(815,6)
the canvas, on which h(657,6)represented(817,6)fixed his eyes upon
herself, she th(170,6)of his regard with a d(171,6)sentiment of gratitude
than(826,8)ever raise(168,8): she remembered its warmth(972,6)softened
its impropriety of expression.

When all of(764,6)ouse(952,6)was open to general inspection(980,10)seen,
they returned down stairs; and, taking leave(109,13)(435,6), wer(672,7)gned ov(573,6)the gardener, who met them at(943,6)all door.

As they walked acros(1020,6)lawn toward(17,6)river, Elizabeth (187,7)back
to look again; her uncle(569,6)unt stopped also(592,6)while the form(646,6)

suddenly came(760,9)from(202,6)oad(683,7)led behind it(319,8)stables.

and spoke to(593,10), if not in terms of perfect composure, at least

She had instinctively(685,8)away(188,7)topping on his approach,

scarcely dared lift he(820,6) to(377,6)ace(818,6)knew not what answer she

alterat(308,7)(285,6)nner since(378,6)last p(874,7)every sente(33,6)at he

impropriety of her being found there recurr(364,7)her mind(519,6)few
minutes in which(568,6)continued together were some(126,7) most
uncomfortable(133,8)life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke,(916,6)ccent had none of its usual sedateness(275,6)he repeat(954,6)
(451,11)s(861,8)ti(179,6)her having left Longbourn(557,6)(320,7)stay

At length(543,8)idea seem(665,6)fail him(509,6)(659,6)standing a(444,6)oments without say(29,6)word, he suddenly recollec(298,6)mself(805,6)took
leave.

The others then joined her(850,6)expressed(949,7)admi(777,13)
figure; but Elizabeth heard not(156,9)and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, follow(116,6)m in silence. She was overpower(67,6)shame and
vexation. Her coming(791,7)was(710,9) unfortunate(794,6)most ill-judged
thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! I(38,8)seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?
or,(22,9)he thus come a day before (354,7)expected? Had they been
only ten minutes sooner,(35,6)should have been beyond the reach(566,8)discrimination; for it w(855,8) that(140,8)that (763,6) arrived, that(784,7) alighted from his horse or his carriag(576,7)blushed(300,6) and

strikingly altered,--what could it mean? T(215,7)(297,7)even speak to
her was amazing!--but to(34,7)with such civility, to inquire after her
family! Never in her lif(584,6)she see(565,6)manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken(133,11)gentl(293,6)as on this un(570,8)(308,9)
What a contrast did it offe(826,7)s last address in Rosings Park, when
he put(46,6)etter into her hand! She knew not(903,6)to think, or how to
account(627,7).

They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side(533,8)water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
(801,9)the woods to which(897,6)were approaching: but(823,8)some time

mechanically(327,6)e repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to(709,6)objects as(222,6)pointed out, she
distinguished no part(913,8)scene. Her(191,7)ts(288,7)ll fixed(659,6)at
one spot of Pemberley House,(351,6)(808,6)t might be, where Mr. Darcy then

At length, however,(713,7)mark(704,9)companions o(74,6)abse(370,7)mind

he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness(286,6)began as(773,6)met to admi(530,6) beauty of the place; but s(135,7)not

her might be mischievously construed. Her colour chang(104,12)said

Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on (579,6)using, he asked
her if s(646,9)do him the honour of introducing(30,6)o her friends.

she, “when he knows who(722,6)are! He takes them now for(163,7) of

attentively to all(117,6)passed between(268,11)gloried in every

his taste, or his good manners.(799,6)(381,13)soon(439,8)upon fishing(793,6)she heard Mr. Darcy

time to supply him(686,7)(195,6) tackle(639,6)pointing (892,6)ose parts of
the stream where(511,11)usually most sport. Mrs(684,10), who was
walking arm in ar(142,7)(716,9), gave her a look (503,8)v(487,8)
wond(769,14)said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly;(998,7)mpliment must be all for herself. Her astonishmen(1011,13)as
extreme(519,6)(414,7)ally was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From

work such a change as this. It is impossible(963,6)he should still love
me.”

After (502,8)some time(705,6)is way, the two ladies in front(25,9)
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of(172,6)curious
water-pla(150,7)re chanced to be a little(473,6)ation. It originated in

her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took he(335,7) by her niece(81,6)they walked on
together. (490,6)a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to
know(589,6)she had been assured of his absence before she came(483,8)pla(167,8)accor(1006,6) began by observing,(696,7)is arrival(115,9)
very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
you would certainly (971,7)here till to-morrow; and, indeed,(223,8)we
left Bakewell, we understood(892,6)you were not immediately (193,8) in
the country.” He acknowledged(895,6)ruth of it all; and sai(102,6)
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours

will join me early(330,10),” he continued, “and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance(233,6)you,--Mr. Bingley an(228,6)sisters.”
(914,10) answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts(436,6)instantly
driven back(718,7) time when (129,11)’s nam(802,11)last mentioned
between them(453,6)if she might judge from(426,8)plexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.

“There is also one other person in(473,10)(404,15) after a
pause, “who mor(519,6)icularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my(438,7)(72,7)r(497,13)
during(1001,6)stay at Lambton?”

The surprise of such an application was great(970,7); it was too(25,6)
for h(131,6)know in what manner she acceded to it. She(984,13)felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy(494,7)have of being(735,9)ed(966,7)er,

They now walked (615,6)silence; each of(999,6)deep(645,6)ought. (934,9)
was not comfortable;(155,6)was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. His wish of(619,9)ing his(622,11)her was a(882,6)iment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped th(863,7)s(980,6)wh(995,6)y had

there seemed an embargo on every subject. At las(507,6)recollected that

great perseverance. Yet(251,6)an(371,6)aunt moved slowly--(27,8)patience

The observations of her uncl(455,6)aunt now began(957,6)each of them

aunt; “but it is confin(919,6)his air(972,6)is not unbe(621,6). I can now
say(511,10)housekeeper, that though(615,6)people may call him proud,

“I was never more surpris(1014,6)n by his behaviour to us. It was more
than civil; i(24,6)really attentiv(639,7)there(113,6)o necessity for such

dreaded lest(480,6)(264,10)(519,7)br(368,6)should have said too much in
her favour; and, more(361,6)commonly anxious to please, she naturally
sus(776,6) that(270,7)power of(52,6)ing would fail her.

She retreated(498,6)the window, fearful of being seen(836,6)(804,7)walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to (361,6)e her(824,6)saw(631,6)looks of

whenever she did catch a glimps(559,6)saw an express(909,7)general
complaisance(894,6)in all(879,6)he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from _hauteur_ or disdai(923,6)is companions, as convinced her
that the improvement of(331,7)s(884,7)s(819,7)yesterday witnessed,
however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one

Their visitors stayed(845,6)them above half an hour;(220,10)they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to joi(445,6)in expressing(770,7)wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner(830,6)Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before(171,6)left t(743,6)ntry.(67,6)Darcy, though(252,6)a

how _she_,(559,6)the(104,11) most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislik(698,9)proposal(835,6)(517,7)in(145,6)usband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to (250,6) it, she ventured to engage for

Bingley(719,8)ed great pleasur(557,9)certainty(739,11)(390,9)
again, having still a(74,7)deal to say to h(774,8)many inquiries to
make(175,7)all (855,6)Hertfordshire friends.(514,10), construing all
this into a(916,9)hearing her speak(21,6)r(988,7), was(243,6)ed; and
on(552,6)account, as well as some others, found herself, when(186,6)
visitors(959,9)m, capable of considering the last half hour(975,6)some
satisfaction(1006,10)hile i(464,6)pass(71,8)enjoyment of it had been

But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity;(311,7)
not(613,7)wish to force her communication. I(825,6)evident tha(131,6)was
much better acquaint(271,8)Mr. Darcy than they(402,7)fore any idea of;
(461,7)(100,13)(99,6) very much in love(543,6)her. They saw(32,6)to
interest, but nothing to justif(885,8)y.

Of(162,11)(589,7)now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as(941,7)(255,8)ance reached, ther(200,6)no fault to find(190,7)could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had(329,6)drawn his character
from(469,7)own feelings(57,6)is servant’s report, without any reference
to any(998,6) account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which(436,8)known
would not have recognized it fo(687,6)Darcy. T(296,11)w an (458,9)
however, in believ(1008,8)housekeeper(287,6)they soon became sensible
that the authority of a(276,8), who had(187,6) him since(646,8)four
years old(937,6)whose own manners indicated respectability,(606,7)t to be
hastily rejected. Neither had any(696,6)occurred in the intelligence of
(961,6)Lambton friends(929,6)could materially lessen its weight(830,7)had
(808,11)accuse him of but pride;(7,6) he probably ha(264,7)if not,

With(445,8) to Wickham(767,6)travellers(613,6)found(113,8)(483,9)held
(1016,6)in(108,6)estimation; for though(851,6)hief of(972,6)oncerns with the

him,(1000,7)(954,9) afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, he(249,8)ts(198,6)at Pemberley this evening more than

she lay awake two whole hours, endeavour(848,7)make them out. She

had almost as(32,6)been ashamed of ev(220,10) a dislike against him,
that could be so called. The(776,9)crea(963,11)convicti(667,9)

time ceased to be repugnant to(427,13)(527,6)(751,7)now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature(204,8)testimony so highly in his
favour(370,6)bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
(814,6)yesterday had produced. But above all,(11,7)(373,8)and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good-will(928,7)(466,6)not be
overlooked. I(306,6)gratitude;--(12,9), not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well(869,11)forgi(221,6) the
petulance and acr(377,6)of her manner in rejecting him(754,6)(67,8)unjust accusations accompany(140,8)(63,7)on. He who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and
without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of(300,7),
where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
opin(971,8)er(810,7)s(759,7)ent on mak(490,8)known to his sister. Such
a change in a man of so much pride excite(665,6)only astonishment but
(665,9)--for to love, ardent(13,7)it must be attributed; and, as
such, its impression o(812,6)was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no
means unpleasing, though it(862,13) exactly defined. Sh(965,9)ed,

that she should employ the power, which(595,6)ancy tol(869,6)she still
possessed, of bringing(871,6)e renewal of his addresses.

It(975,9) settled i(54,6)evening, betwee(75,6)aunt and niece, that

On(940,6)ing the hous(707,6)(718,6) shown through(35,6)all into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,
opening (93,7)ground, admitted a most refre(699,6)view(613,8)high woody
hills behin(711,6)(217,7)and(659,8)beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
which(266,7)cattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this room(328,11)receiv(712,6)Miss Darcy, who was sitt(389,7)re(490,6)Mrs. Hurst and(682,13)(907,6)the lady with whom she lived in
London. Georgiana’s reception(922,7)m was(685,6)civil, but attended with
all(813,6)embarrassment which, though proceeding from shynes(344,6)the
fear of doing wrong,(662,7)easily give(506,6)ose who felt themselves

succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken b(193,7)Annes(581,6)
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, (985,6)endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse prov(312,6) to be more truly well-bred than either(962,7)
others; and between h(438,6)(456,14),(756,6)occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.(907,11) looked as if she
wish(350,7)courage enough to join in it(174,6)sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when(997,6) was least dang(261,6)its(715,7)heard.

inconvenient distance; bu(282,10)not sorry(645,7)spa(631,6)e necessity
of saying much: her own thoughts(979,6)employ(247,7). She expected every

feared,(484,6)the mast(801,9) house might be amongst them(822,6)whether

sitting in this manner a quar(147,7)an hou(910,7)out hearing Miss

inquiry af(311,8)health of her family(402,6)answered with equal
indifference and brevity, (783,6)e other said no more.

The next vari(720,7)hich their visit afforded was produc(888,6)the
entrance of servants(153,6)cold meat, cake(138,6)a variety of all the
finest fruits in season(742,6)this di(965,6)take place till(303,7)many a
significant look and smile(367,6)Mrs. Annesle(1015,15) had been

While thus engaged(700,12)had a fair opportuni(441,6)deciding(902,13)most(897,8)or(917,8)(277,8)appea(554,9)Mr.(377,6),(584,8)feelings(640,7)prevailed on his entering the room(291,9)n,(353,8)but
a moment before she(477,7)lieve(464,6)wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.

H(78,8)en some time(905,6)Mr. Gardiner, who,(929,6)two or thre(902,7)

resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary(73,7)made, but perhaps no(226,6)more easily kept, because she

curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite(515,7)

objects; for jealousy ha(249,6)yet made her desperate,(692,6)er(205,8)ons

entrance, exert(978,6)self much(538,6)to talk(821,6)(687,10)(536,9)he
was anxious for his sister(182,8)self to get acquainted(213,6)forwarded,
as(121,6)as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side(240,6)
(447,7) saw all this likewise; and, i(813,6)imprudence of anger, took the
(618,6)opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--

“Pray,(588,6)Eliza, are(883,9)----shire militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”

In(523,6)’s presence she dare(853,6)m(570,6) Wickham’s name: but(475,10)
instantly comprehende(959,7)h(956,6)uppermost i(596,6)thoughts(551,6)the
various recollections connected(318,6)him gav(749,6)a moment’s distress;
but(670,7)ing(671,9)vigorously to repel(462,6)ll-natured attack, she
(272,6)tly answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While

complexion, earnestly looking at her(1005,7)(838,10)overcome with

refrain(701,8)the hint; but she had merely int(589,7)o discompose
(636,9), by bringing forwar(427,6)idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to mak(601,6)betray a sensibility which might injur(645,6)in

and absurdities b(116,8)some part of her(963,7) were(801,15)

meditated elopement. To no creatur(416,6)it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to (442,9)(1017,6)from all(624,8)’(1010,9)ions
her brother was(430,6)cularly anxious to conceal it,(597,8)at very wish
(444,6)(566,9) had long ago attribut(614,6)him, of their becoming

Bennet, it is prob(975,6)(85,7)(673,6)add something(215,6)s lively(301,6)rn

(869,10)’s coll(614,6)behaviour, however, soon quieted(200,6)motio(255,6)
as(611,6)(483,7), vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. H(614,10), whose eye she fear(536,6)meet, scarcely

person,(664,12)and dress. But(561,11)woul(609,6)join her. Her
(509,7)’s recommendation was(579,11)insure(156,6)avour: his judgment

“How(774,6)ill(715,6) Bennet looks this morning,(586,10),” she cried: “I
never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.
S(25,6)grown so brow(744,6)coarse! Louisa and I were agree(721,6)at we
sh(301,10)ave know(897,6)again.”

However litt(803,13)migh(55,7)liked(540,6)an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying,(145,6)he perceived no(541,6)(269,6)(720,6)than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summ(476,6)For my own part(436,7)rejoined, “I must confess(319,6)I (459,6)(823,6)see

tolerable, but not out of the common wa(162,7)as for her eyes, which

like(309,7)(342,6)(410,6) air altogether,(301,10)a self-sufficiency
without fashion(100,8)is in(305,9).”

Persuad(954,6)Miss Bingley wa(566,7)(828,6)admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people(552,10)lways
wise(248,9)s(1021,6)him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all(811,7)ccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a
determin(972,6)of mak(144,8)speak(120,6)continued,--

“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find(960,6)sh(191,6)a reputed(956,7)(893,6)I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after t(671,6)d(756,6)dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_
a(112,7)! I should as soo(813,6) her mother a wit.’ But(105,6)wards she
seemed to improve on you,(198,7)believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time.”

“Yes,” replied(692,6), who(943,7)contain himself no longer, “but _that_
was only(440,6)I(439,15); for it is many months since I have
considered(950,6)s one of the handsomest wome(596,6)y acquaintance.”

themselves. The one(258,10)m(152,6)(555,8)ttended to; (306,11)
(239,8)five days ago(79,6)(778,10)contained an account of all(657,6)

but(307,6)atter half,(504,11)dated a day lat(617,8)(436,8)in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to(827,6)effect:--

“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious natu(856,8)I am afrai(57,6)larming you--be
assur(759,7) we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
An expres(659,7)at twelve last night,(729,6)as we we(106,7)gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us(170,6)she was(61,6)off to Scotland

very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! B(445,8)willing
to hope the best(679,6)that his charac(737,6)s been misunderstood.
Thoughtles(845,6)indiscreet I can easily believe him, (829,6)is step (and
let us rejoice over it) marks no(691,6)bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her(100,8).
Our(646,6)mother is sadly grieved. M(66,9)bears it better. How
thankful am I,(774,9)never let them(140,6)what(348,10)said against
him; w(185,7)forget it ourselves. They(755,6)off Saturday(791,6) about

eight. The(915,9)was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they(381,6)have
passed within ten miles of us.(934,16) gives(537,6)ason to (777,6)
him here soon. Lydia left a few lines(509,6)is wife,(1008,7)ing her of
their intention. I(552,6)conclude(574,6)I cannot be long from my poor
(550,6)(919,6) afraid you will (54,7)able to make(453,6)t(774,6)I hardly

Without allow(190,7)self time for consideration(964,6)scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing(920,6)letter, instantly seized the
other(101,6)opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had(757,6)(233,7) a day later than the(393,7)sion of the first.

“By(172,6)time, m(630,6)est sister, you(331,6)received my hurried(226,7); I

day before, not many hours af(636,6)e express. T(501,6)Lydia’s short

to(341,10)., who(1024,12)taking the alarm, set off from B.,

no farther; for on enter(129,6)at(588,8)they removed into a
hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise(919,6)brought(442,6)from Epsom.
All(953,6)is known(540,9)is is,(473,16)seen to continue the
London road. I(968,6)not(972,6)to think. After m(352,6)every possible

broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.
I am sincerely grieved for him and(998,8); but no one can throw any
bl(168,8)hem. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and
mother(996,6)ve the worst(366,6)I cannot(571,6) so ill of him. Many
circumstances might make it more eligible for(902,6)to be married
privately in town than to purs(731,6)ir first plan; and even if _he_
could form(520,6)a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,
which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to(831,6)thing?
Im(839,8)! I(472,7) to find, however(970,7)(840,11)(111,7)disposed

wonder. I am truly glad, dearest(895,8)that you have been spared
something of these(965,9)ing scenes(154,6)now, as the(778,7)shock is
over, shall I (832,7)t I long for your return?(175,6)not so selfish,

again to do, w(133,6)have just told you I(534,7)no(375,7)circumstances
are such(810,7)I(368,7) help earnestly begging you all to come here as
soon as (916,8). I know my dear uncle(624,6)unt so well(118,9)(294,6)
afraid of requesting it, though(226,8)still (465,10)more to ask of
the former. M(728,8) is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,
to try to discover her. What he means(387,8)I am sure(251,8)(370,8)

“Oh! where,(7,6) is(169,9)?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to fo(418,8), without losing a
moment of the time so precious(884,6)(109,7)reac(108,8)door, it was
opened by a servant(475,6)Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale fa(401,7)impetuous manner made him star(75,7)before he could re(722,7)imself
enough to speak, she, in whose mind(486,6) idea was supersed(187,6)Lydia’s
situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, bu(516,9)leave you.
(534,8)i(264,7)Gardiner this (375,8)n busi(426,6)hat cannot be delayed;
I have(875,6)n(992,8) to lose.”

“Good God!(656,6)is the matter(595,9)he(510,6) more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting(354,8), “I(1013,10)detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the(531,10)go after Mr.(544,7)s(281,10). You are
not well (469,6); you(282,8)go yourself.”

(809,9) hesitated(692,6)her knees trembled under her(934,6)she felt how
little would be gai(723,7)her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
(238,13)therefore, she commissioned(908,6)though in so breathless an
accent as(780,7)er almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home(566,8)ly.

On his quit(210,6)he room(167,6)sat down, unable to support her(522,6)and
looking so miserably ill,(713,6)it was impossible for Darcy to(809,7)her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentlen(290,6)d(336,7)er(940,6)
“Let me call(927,6)maid. Is(393,6) nothing(588,6)ould take to gi(948,6)
present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one?(694,8) very ill.”

“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavour(595,7)recov(669,6)self. “There

some dreadful news which I have just received(388,6)Longbourn.”

She burst into tears as she alluded to it(859,6)for a few minutes(370,6)
not speak another word.(535,6), in wretched suspense,(429,7)only sa(203,6)(458,6)indistinctly of his

again.(113,9)just had a letter(736,6)Jane,(455,6)such(410,14). It
cannot be conceal(407,8)anyone. My youngest sister has left all her
friends--has eloped; has thrown(976,8)(468,7)he power of--of Mr.
Wickham. They are g(910,6)f togeth(210,8)Brighton. _You_ know him too
well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,(765,11)at
can tempt(89,7)--she is lost for ever.”

Darcy was fixed in astonishment.

“When I consider(929,7)added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_
might(834,6)prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained(926,6)part of it only--(22,13)what I learnt, to my own family! Had
his character been known, thi(900,7) no(178,7)happened. But it is all,
all too late now.”

“I am griev(289,6)deed,” cried(960,6): “(32,7)--shock(91,9)s it

“Oh, yes!(619,6)left(597,9)(620,10)on Sunday night(942,6)were traced

“And(446,7)as(336,6)done,(20,15)attempted, to recover her?”

“My fath(928,7)(103,7)(158,9)and Jan(776,6)written to beg my uncle’s

such a ma(172,7) worked on? How are(360,6)ev(207,8) discovered? I have
not the smallest hope. It is e(144,6)ay horrible!(986,9)shook his head in silent acquiescence(998,9)_my_ eyes(554,6)opened to his real(821,10), oh! had(277,7)n what

much. Wretched, w(10,7) mistak(225,11)made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her(775,7)as walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed(897,6)instantly understood it. Her power
was sinking;(475,6)(649,6)_must_ sink(61,6) (604,7)proof of family
weakness,(33,7)n assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
wonder nor condemn; bu(647,6)belief of his self-conquest brough(790,9)
consolator(394,7)r bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
was, o(418,6)(381,6)ry, exactly calculat(684,6)make her(355,8)and her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt(987,6)s(279,9)have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.

But self, though it would intrude,(373,8)ot engross her. Lydia--the
humi(284,7), the misery she was bringing(288,7)m all--soon swallowed up
every private care(264,6)covering her face with her handkerchief,

several minutes, was only recall(449,6)a sense(521,8)situ(538,6)by the
voi(715,6)her companion, who, in a manner which(380,12)spoke
compassion,(18,6) likewise restraint, said,--

“I am afraid you(523,6)been long desiring my absence, nor(563,6)I an(962,6)
to plead in exc(276,6) my stay, but real(557,9)unavailing concern.
Would to Heaven(678,6)(98,8)(962,7)be (964,6) said or done on my part,
that might offer (934,8)ion to such(898,9)! But I will not torment
you(556,6)vain (860,6),(374,6) may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the
pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”

“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”

He readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed(29,6)orrow for

reas(567,6)hope,(1020,6)le(412,6)his compliments for her re(622,6)s, with
only one serious parting look, went away.

As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was(817,6)they
should ever see each other(312,7)on(776,6)terms of cordiality as had
mark(132,6)ir several meetings in Derbyshire; a(612,6)she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of(96,7)acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed (247,6) perverseness(91,6)ose

If gratitude and esteem are good found(543,6) of affection(484,11)’s
chang(1009,7)ntiment will be neither(513,12)nor faulty. But if
otherwise, if(586,6)egard springing from(519,6)sources is un(756,6)able or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object(367,6)even before two words(424,6)been

somewhat of a trial to the latter method,(84,8)part(799,7)for Wickham,
and(887,6)its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the(919,6)

with regret(917,6)in this early examp(888,6)what Lydia’s infamy must
produce,(682,6) additional anguish(1001,8)reflected on(357,6)wretched

marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this(657,6)(301,8). His most particular
friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. Wickham will(43,7)(30,6)a woman without some(449,6). He
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia,(23,6)attraction(28,6)she
beyond youth, health, and good humour,(1020,6)(492,6)make him for her sake
forego every chance of benefiting himself by(254,6)ing well? As to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in(1002,6)orps (672,6)throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects(839,6)such a step(126,7)produce. But as to your
other obj(669,6)(122,7)afraid it(502,6)hardly hol(375,6).(439,6) has no

behaviour(28,7)his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give(432,8) was going(148,8) in his family(569,7)_he_ would
do as(107,9)nd think(20,12)bout it, as(993,6)ather(637,7)do, in
(384,7)matter.”

“But can you(83,7)that(328,7)is so lost t(676,7)(476,6)but love(938,6)m,
(442,6)consent to live(568,7)im on any (469,6)terms than marriage?”

“It does seem(843,6)it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. But, really,(764,7) not(480,6)to say.
Perhaps(824,10)doing her justi(762,8)she is very young: s(583,7)never
been taught to(510,7)on serious subjects(732,6)for(667,6)ast half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth,(108,9)been given up to (973,8)but amusement
and vanity. S(59,12)allow(751,6)dispo(356,6)her time in the(465,6)idle
and frivolous manner(507,6)to adopt(568,6)pinions(790,6)ca(75,6)her way.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton,(218,13)love,
flirtation(638,6)officers, have(284,6)(598,7)head(251,15)doing
(804,11)(641,7)power, by(946,6)ing(959,6)alking o(275,6)(447,7), to give
greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which
are naturally lively enough. And we all(701,6)that Wickham has(1009,6)
charm of person and addres(400,9)n captivate a woman.”

“But you see(443,6)Jane,” said her aunt, “does not(727,7)so ill of
(142,7), as to believe him capable of the attempt.”

“Of whom does Jane ever(820,7)ill?(251,6)ho is there, whatever might be
their former conduct,(642,6)she would(146,9)(142,11)such an(146,8),
till it(659,6)proved against them? Bu(283,6) knows, as well as I do(158,6)(269,8) really is. We both(448,11)(969,12)profligate in(462,7)sen(917,6)the word;(56,13)neither integrity nor honour(42,10)is
as false and deceitful as(32,6) insinuating.”

“And do you(192,8)know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
(520,6)the mode of (174,8)lligence was all alive.

“(323,6)indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spok(730,9)man who had(116,6)ed with
such forbearanc(395,6)liberality towards him(1005,6)there ar(214,7)
circumstances which I am not at(76,6)ty--(27,6)it i(935,6)worth while to
relate; but his lies about(614,6)hole Pemberley family are endless. From
w(705,7)said of Miss(342,6), I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew(585,8)contrary himself. He
must(854,11)sh(600,7)s amiabl(760,6)unpretending(949,6) have found
her.”

“But does Lydia(940,6)nothing(905,6)is? can she be ignorant of(537,6)you
and Jane seem so well to understand?”

“Oh, yes!--that,(989,6)is(1007,8)st of all. Till(343,7)in Kent, and saw
so much both of(735,10) and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam(430,7)
(201,12)the truth my(358,6)And(793,6)I returned home the ----shire
w(1011,6)leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As(439,6)(563,6)e
case, neither Jane, to whom I(203,6)ed(684,10), nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for(440,9)use could it
apparently be to anyone(418,7)the good opinion,(911,7)all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even(359,6)it
was settled(728,6)(658,6)(67,7)go with Mrs. Forster, the (253,6)ity of
opening her eyes to his character never occur(929,7)me. That _she_(277,6)
be in any danger from the deception(75,7)entered my head(76,7)such a
consequence as _this_(279,8)ensue, you may easily believ(979,6)far
enough(128,6)my(503,8)s.”

“When they all remov(212,6)Brighton, therefor(105,7)had no reason, I
suppos(628,6)(123,8)them fond of each other?”

“No(529,6)slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on (741,6)
side;(942,6)ad anything(906,8)kind been perceptibl(295,8)ust be aware
that ours is not a family on(675,7)it(741,7)be (634,6) away. When first
he(452,9)the corps, sh(387,6)ready (389,7)to admire him; but so we all
were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for
the(154,6) two months: but he(703,7)distinguished _her_ by any particular
attention; and, (653,9)tly, after a moderate perio(499,6)xtravagant and
wild(249,6)ation, her fancy for him gave way, and(559,6)s(465,8)regiment,
who treated her(979,6)more(210,7)c(95,6)again became(108,7)vourites.”

It may be(819,15)d, that however little of novelty(524,10)added
to their fears, hopes(194,6)conjectures, on this interesting subject by
its rep(215,6)discussion, no(825,6)(644,7)detain(862,7)rom it long, during
the who(180,6)the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was(536,7)absent.
Fix(718,6)re by(854,6)eenest of all a(574,6), self-reproach(759,6)could
find no(245,6)val of ease or forgetfulness.

They travelled as expeditiously as possibl(1016,7)sleeping one night on
the road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. I(260,6)a comfort

expectation(230,7)(596,8)Gardiners, attract(55,6)the s(207,6)f a chaise, were standing
on(40,6)tep(804,9)house, as they enter(451,6) paddock(313,6)when the
carriage drove up (718,6) door,(574,7)yful surprise(797,6)lighted up(764,6)
faces and displayed itself over(802,7)(663,6)bodies, in a variety of
caper(69,6)frisks, w(203,6) first pleasing ear(647,8)(89,7)elcome.

(434,10)jumped out(558,6)after giv(66,6)ch(800,7)m a hasty kiss,
hurried in(268,7)vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from
her mother’s apartment, immediately met her(185,12), as she affection(43,6)embraced her, whilst tears fill(939,6)
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard(596,8)fugitives.

“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now(795,6)my dear uncle is come, I hope
ever(114,7)will be well.”

“Is my father in town?”

“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”

“And(916,6)you (209,6)from him ofte(87,6)We(953,6)(242,7)nly once. He(85,7)me a few lines on Wedn(125,7)to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his dir(475,6)s, which I
particularly begged him to do. He merely added,(905,6)he should not write
again, till(150,8)some(485,6)of importance to mention(309,9)my(693,7)--how is she? How ar(357,6)all?”

“M(43,8) is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. She is up(835,6)(311,6)will(455,6)great satisfaction in seeing you

Heaven! are quit(667,11)But you(278,6)(266,7)?” cried (957,9). “You look pale. How much you
must(208,7)one through!”

Her sister, however, assur(1010,6) of her being perfect(365,7);(611,6)heir
conversation(604,8)(985,8) pass(1019,6)ile Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with(89,6) children, was now put an e(735,6)by the approach of
the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt(499,7)elcomed and
thanked them both,(147,6)alternate smiles(868,6)ears.

When they were all in the draw(515,8), the questions(903,7)(457,9)
had already asked(78,6)of course repeated(250,8)othe(696,8)they soon
found(940,6)Jan(910,6)no intellige(902,7)give. The sanguine hope of good,
(532,9)(467,6)the benevolence(542,8)heart suggested,(111,7)t yet
desert(591,6); she still expecte(166,7)it would all e(401,6)l(214,8)at
every morning(43,7)bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to expla(411,6)ir proceeding(1021,6), perhaps, announce the marriage.

Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment(517,6)all repaired, after a few minutes’(821,13) together, receiv(639,8)exactly as might be(315,9); with
tear(652,6)lamenta(603,6)of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham(792,6)complaints(493,8)own suffering(771,6)ill-usage;
blaming everybody bu(109,6)person(304,10)ill-judging indul(662,7)he
error(113,9)daughter must be principally owing.

“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton
(1000,7)l my family, _this_(672,7)not have happened: but poor dear(631,6)
(881,6)body to take ca(969,6)her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of(681,7)sight? I am sure there was(771,6)great neglect or other o(745,7)
side, for she is no(518,6)kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked(729,6). I always though(772,7)were very unfit to have
the charg(272,8); but I was over-ruled, as(90,10)am. Poor, dear
child! And now here’s Mr(922,8) gone away(713,6)I k(40,6) will fight

we shall do.”

They all exclaimed against(490,6)terrific ideas(122,6)Mr. Gardiner,(487,6)
general assurance(932,6)is affection for her and all her(841,9)told her
that(363,6)ant to be in Lond(688,6)(566,6)next d(450,8)(896,6)assist Mr.

“D(297,6)give way(331,6)eless alarm,” added he: “(716,6) it is righ(171,7)

may gain some news of them(581,6)till we(769,6)tha(926,7)(597,8)married,
and have no design of marrying,(615,8)let us(325,6)the matter over as

come home with me to Gracechurch Street(932,11)we may consult
together as to(939,8)(621,7)done.”

“Oh, my dear(850,9)” replied Mrs. (615,6), “t(67,7)exactly(1022,6)I
could most wish for. And now do, when you(264,14)fi(185,6)m out,

for she does not know which ar(993,6)best warehouses. Oh,(950,10)how
kind you are! I(69,6)you will contrive it all.”

But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, (906,6)not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fear(555,7)(714,7)alking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table,(978,6)lef(400,6)to vent all(105,7)eling(49,6)he

occasion for(801,6)a seclu(21,6)rom the family(221,7)di(375,7)ttempt to

too busily engag(550,9)ir separate apartments to make(34,7)appearance

faces of both, however,(634,6)tolerably calm(859,6)no chang(643,6)visible
in either, except(684,9) loss(762,8)favourite(737,7), (617,6) anger
which(618,9)herself incurr(846,10)business, had given something more
of fretfulness than usual to(914,6)ccents of(421,6). As for Mary, she was
mistress(745,8)(961,6)self to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection,(565,6)af(743,6)(586,9)ea(791,13)--

“This is a most unfortunate affair(830,6)will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malic(904,7)pour in(300,7)wounded bosoms of
each(599,7)the balm of(468,7)ly consolation.”

Then perceiving in(304,10) no inclination of replying(391,6)added,
“Unhappy as the event(203,6)be for Lydia, we may draw(786,6)it this useful
lesson:--that(669,9)virtue in a female is irretrievable,(723,6)one
false step involves her in endless ruin(50,7)her reput(226,6)is no less
brittle(672,6)it is beautiful(960,8)at she cannot be too(474,6)guarded in
her behaviour toward(296,6)undeserving of the(441,7)sex.”

(393,10)lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was(129,10)oppressed to
make any(447,6).(841,7)however, continued to(544,7)e(994,9)with such
kind of moral extractions(460,6)(506,6)il before them.

In(981,6)fternoon,(730,6)wo elder Miss Bennets(872,6)able to(572,8)half an
hour by themselves; and(687,11)instantly availed(197,9)(350,6)
opportunity(855,6)king any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After join(824,7)general lamen(593,6)s ov(905,7)dreadful sequel
of(763,6)event,(119,7)(891,10)considered as all but certain(640,6)Miss

have(134,6)lready heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of an(137,7)(627,10) elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”

“(138,7) (138,8)did own(1011,6)he had often suspected some(217,6)ality,
especially on Lydia’s side(944,6)no(326,6)to give him any alarm. I am so
grieved(780,6)im. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
_was_ com(116,7)us, in order to assure us of his concern,(977,8)(248,6)
any idea(853,7)ir not being gone to Scotland: whe(311,7)(445,12)
first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”

“And was Denny convinced(399,6)Wickham w(771,9)marry? Did he know of

“Yes; but(217,6)questioned by _him_,(166,7)denied knowing(683,10)(138,9)pla(969,7)(186,10)(520,7)s real opinion(871,9). He did not
repeat his persua(789,8)(404,10)marr(969,6)and from _that_ I am
inclined to hope he migh(804,7)been misunderstood(871,7)(403,9)till(312,17)came(306,8), not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose,(595,10)(591,6)really married?”

“How was it possible(918,6)such an(667,6)should(111,6) our brains? I felt a
little uneasy--a (17,7)fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew(753,6)(836,7)duct ha(667,6)been always quite
right. My father and mother(76,6)no(569,8) that; they only(204,6)how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned,(197,6)a very natural
triumph on(693,9)more than the rest of us,(978,6)in Lydia’s last letter
she had prepared her for(419,7) step. S(38,7)known, it seems(516,10)
(516,6)in love(376,6)each (284,6)many weeks.”

“But(353,7)f(181,6)ey went to Brighton?”

“No, I believe not(719,9)did(718,17)appear to think ill of Wickham(744,8)? Does he
know(961,10)character?”

“I(402,6)confess(548,7)(977,9) speak so we(101,14)as he formerly
did. He(195,8)d him to be (519,11)nd extravagant; and since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said(164,9)left Meryton greatly in debt:
but I hop(93,7)may be false.”

“Oh, Jane, had we(775,6)less secret(25,9)told what we(843,6)of him,
t(847,6)ul(841,6)have happened!”

“Perhaps it would(35,6)been better,” repli(658,7)(988,6).(572,7)to expose t(365,9) faults of any person(829,6)out(806,9)what

“He brought it(854,6)him for us to see.”

Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These

“Oh, thoughtless(13,13)(669,6)!” cried Elizabeth(732,6)she had
finished it. “(700,7)letter is this,(922,7)written at such a moment! But
at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her(258,10)Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a

The whole party were in hopes of a letter(828,6)Mr. Benne(675,6)next

“I(887,6)writt(630,6)Colonel Forster to desire(719,8)fi(762,6), if

Mr. Gardiner di(999,6)write again, till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then(57,8)nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known(835,6)Wickham had a singl(921,7)ion(894,6)whom he kept up

leave it(27,6)m to do whatever occasion(274,7)suggest to be advisable
for continuing(190,7)pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children(420,7)ed,(893,9)ing

“EDW. GARDINER.”

“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth,(830,6)she had finished. “Can(287,6)
(62,8)(953,6)h(913,7)marry her?”

“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as w(384,7)thought him,” said her
sister. “My dear father,(889,6)gratulate you.”

“And(464,6)you(544,7)ed the letter?(92,7)(240,9).

“No; but it must be done soon.”

Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no(414,6)time b(768,6)he
wrote.

“Oh! m(208,14)” she(396,6), “come(744,6)and(693,7)(1001,11).

“Let me(777,7)(963,7)(369,8)Jane, “if you dislik(1022,6)trouble

“Money! my(93,6)!”(752,6)(631,8)what do you mean, sir?(617,6)mean(207,6)no man in his proper senses would(366,6) Lydia on so slight

Mr. Bennet made no answer(814,6)each of them, deep i(233,6)ght, continued

would, (420,11)do for all. After a slight prepa(808,6) for good news,
(201,11)was(287,6)aloud.(130,12) could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had(361,6)Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,
her joy burst forth(1011,6)every following sentence add(806,6)its
exuberance. Sh(616,6)now in an irrit(264,6)as violent(450,6)de(300,6)as she

felicity, nor humbl(41,6)any remembrance of her misconduct.

“My dear, dear(378,6)!” she cried: “this is(258,8)ful indeed!(322,6)ill
(192,10)! I shall see her again(44,10)(236,12)at sixteen! My

“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,(822,6)added, “in a great

assist Mr.(693,9)with money.”

“Well,”(955,6)(1005,6)o(593,6)“it is all very right; who should do it but

CHAPTER L.(97,16)]

Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before(596,6)period of his life(580,6),
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision(112,8)children(755,6)(133,7)wife, if she survived

be her husband(1013,9)en(213,6)rested in its proper place.

He was seriously concerned(1002,6)a cause of so littl(759,11) to anyone

was determined, if possible, to find ou(88,6)extent(695,8)assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as so(8,6)he(442,6).

When first (832,15)married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to(621,6)a son. This son was to join

could(822,6)no hesit(969,6)in acc(335,7)o(148,6)roposal before him. In

expressed most concisely, he(608,6)deliver(308,6)paper his perfect
approb(193,6)of all(905,6)was don(964,7)his willingness to fulfil the
engagements(792,7)(814,8)made for(249,6)H(651,6)never(274,8)supposed
that, (349,6)Wickham b(690,6)ail(499,7)o marry his daughter, it w(573,7)

That(371,12) (371,11)uch trifling exer(600,6)n his side, too, was

of rage(330,7)had produce(769,6)activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally return(397,6)all his former indolence. His letter was soon
despatched(264,6)(1005,6) dilatory in undertaking(232,9), he was quick in
its execution. He begg(544,6)know further particulars of(666,6)(77,6)
indebt(596,7)is brother; bu(733,8)o angry(888,6)Lydia to send any

conversation, had Miss(270,7)Bennet come upo(671,6)town; or, as the
happiest alternative,(915,6)secluded from the world in some distant
farm-house. But ther(532,6)much to be talked of, in marry(716,7)(363,6)the
good-natured wishes(915,6)er well-doing,(812,14)ceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but(971,8)of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because(644,6)such a husband her misery
was considered certain.

(556,7)a fortnight since Mrs.(449,8)had(520,6)down stairs, but o(160,6)
happy day she again took her seat at(731,6)ead of her table, and in
(242,6)s oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp(868,7)
triumph. The marri(679,6) a daughter(444,12)bee(798,6)first object of
her(510,8)(270,6)Jan(592,6)sixteen, was now(258,6)e point of

attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new c(235,7)s, and
servants. Sh(775,6)busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation(774,9)(328,8); and, without knowing or(616,9)ing
wh(504,6)ir income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

“Haye Park(73,7)do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or(1000,6)reat house at Stoke, (61,7)drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off. I could not bear to have(748,6)en miles from me; and as for
Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”

Bennet, before you take any, or all of these(359,6)s, for your son and
(916,10)let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_(443,7)in this
(706,14)they shall never(390,6)admit(584,6) I will not encourag(286,6)imprudence of either, by receiv(826,6)em at Longbourn.”

A long dispute fo(412,7)this declaration(579,6)Mr. (322,6) was firm: it
soon led to anoth(871,7) Mrs(50,9)fou(889,8) amazement and horror,
that h(554,11)(772,6)not advance a guinea to buy clothes(998,6)is(410,9). He protested that she should(278,7)e(724,6)him no mark of
affec(637,7)atever on the occasion.(216,13)(829,6)hardly comprehend
it. That his anger(872,7)be carri(304,6)such a point of inconceivable
resent(298,6)s to refuse his (646,8) a privilege(352,6)out which her
marriage(335,7)scarcely seem valid, exceeded all(302,10)(176,8)lieve
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace,(128,10) wa(218,6)new
(432,8)must reflect on her(208,9)’s nuptials, than(599,6)y sense of
shame (557,7)eloping and l(747,6)with Wickham a fortnight(1015,8)they
took place.

her sister; for since her (462,16)o shortly give the proper
termination(415,8)elope(157,6)they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning(817,6)(548,6)ose who were not immediately(818,7)

S(307,6) no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy sh(737,8)have(667,6)confidently depended;
but at the same time t(102,6)as no one(94,7)knowledge of a(403,7)’s
frailty(114,15)tified her so much. Not, however(564,7)any(264,8)
disadvantage(594,6)it individually to herself(523,6)at any rat(182,7)
seemed a gulf impass(440,7)tween them. Had Lydia’s(582,10)been
concluded(440,7)(765,7)on(513,8)terms, it(799,7)t to be supposed that

objection(736,7)now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest

From such a(183,8)ion she c(136,7)t wonder that he sh(898,6)hrink. The

anxious, uneasy.

expressively at(505,6)(1006,6)she(818,6)never heard nor saw any(597,8)

and returne(758,9),(737,6)she(556,7)them pass(987,7)ough the hall to
the dining-parlou(126,7)then joine(69,7)soon (939,7)to see(681,6), with

Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission(251,8)he left London(635,6)he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted th(63,6)ir stay would(846,6) short; and
she made the most(369,8)time by(282,6)ing about(254,6)her daugh(750,8)
having very frequent parties at home. These(23,9)were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circl(297,6)even more desir(57,7) such as did
think than(23,12) not.

(431,7)’s affection for Lydia was just what(614,10) had expected to
find it; not equal to(68,6)’(940,6)him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason(781,6)ings, that
(480,6)elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by his(981,6)she(561,7)have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to(157,6)(567,10)at all,(279,6)h(875,6)felt certain
that his flight was re(128,7)necessary by distress of circumstance(196,6)

of (735,7)a companion.

(563,10)exceedingly fo(943,6)him. H(990,6)her dear (638,7) on every
occasion; n(977,6)was(519,7)put in competition(893,7)(89,7)did
everything best in the world(458,11)as sure (470,9)kill(838,6)birds
o(56,6)first of September(839,6)anybody else(100,8)country.

One morning, soon after (669,6)arrival, as(141,10)itting(534,10)two
elder sisters, she said to(905,10),--

“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were
not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Ar(697,6)you
curious to hear how i(695,6)managed?”

“No, really,” replied(216,10); “I think there cannot be too little
said (427,7)subject.”

“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you(159,9)ent off. We(269,6)married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because(712,8)’s lodgings(871,6)(960,8)parish. And(269,8)settled(916,8) should all be(246,7)by eleven
o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I(982,7)o go together(753,6)(438,10)

“Well, Monday(707,8) came(513,6)I was in such a fuss!(22,7)so afraid,
(305,10)that some(915,6)(876,6)happen to(978,6)t off(609,9)n I(266,7)

rather thin, but, h(538,8)the Little Theat(672,7)open(409,16),(629,9)the carriage came to the door,(339,10)was

and if we were beyo(993,6) hour we c(666,6)ot(765,12)all day. But,
luckily, h(327,7)back again(917,7) minutes’ time(803,6)then we all set
out(1003,13)recollected afterwards,(751,6)if he _had_ been prevented
going(530,6)wedding nee(195,9)put off(285,6)Mr. Darcy might have done as
well.”

“(38,9)!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

“Oh, yes! h(380,9)come(791,7)with Wickham(985,6)know(337,6) gracious me!
I quite forgot! I ought not to(179,6)said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will(136,8) say? It(555,8)be such a secret!”

“If i(34,12)(29,8),”(134,6)Jane, “say not another(155,6)on the
subject. You may depend(856,6)my seeking no further.”(337,7)certainly(111,8)(391,11)though burning(354,6)curiosity; “we will
ask you no questions.”

“Thank you(204,8)Lydia; “for if you did, I should(143,10) tell you
all(736,11)(346,8)would be so angry.”

On(352,6)encouragement to ask,(609,10) was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.

But to live in ignorance o(122,7)a poin(497,6)impossible; or at least it
(31,14)(634,8)try for information.(850,11)had(923,6)at her

where he had apparently(170,7)to do(381,6)(17,7)emptation to go.
Conjectures (916,6)the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but s(990,7)satisfied(986,6)none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
could not bear(947,6)suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter (238,6) aunt, to request an explan(347,6)of what
Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible(922,6)the secrecy which(561,9)
intended.

“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my(1010,10) must be to
know how a person unconnect(434,8)any of us, and,(176,6)ratively
speaking, a strang(288,6)our family, should have(761,7)mongst you at such

I must confess myself(272,6)surprised by(196,6)application; I(725,9)expect it from _you_.(340,6)Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,(409,6)t(189,8)(836,6)imagined such(975,11)to be necessary on _your_(207,7)ide. If you do(288,6)hoose to understand me, forgive my(540,6)impertinence. Your uncle is as much(304,11)as I am; and nothing(612,6)but(738,7)lief of(541,6)being a party concerned would(595,6)allowed(683,6)him to act as he has done. But i(229,6)are really innocent an(67,7)ignorant,(515,8)be more explicit. On the very day of my com(207,9)home(501,6)Longbourn,(751,6)(286,6)had a most un(551,6)ed visitor. Mr(551,8)arcy called(1014,6)was shut up with him several hours. It was a(754,8)over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully rack(351,8)as(570,6)s_ seems to(984,6)been. He cam(841,10)Mr. Gardiner(921,6)h(972,7)had found out where(842,6)sister and Mr. Wickham were(256,6)(71,17)seen(26,6)alked(277,6)them both--(67,8)repeatedly, Lydia once(911,7)From w(847,6)can collect, he left Derbyshire(918,6)one day after(358,7)urselves(425,6)(266,9)own(149,9) resolution of hunting fo(68,7)them. The motive professe(505,6)his convic(66,8)its(805,7)owing to(777,9)self(374,6)(326,7)’s worthlessness had not been so well known as(145,7)o make it impossible for any young woman of character to love (216,8)confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken(989,6)prid(518,7)con(279,7)(599,7) had(739,8)thought it benea(805,7)(283,8)lay his private actions open to(134,6)orld.

If he _had another_(584,7), I am sure it would nev(700,8)disgrace(414,9)(112,9)some days in(716,6)(358,7)he was able(630,9)discover them; bu(411,9)someth(674,6) direct his search,(230,7)w(631,8)m(456,6)an _we_ had;(1022,7)e consciou(708,6)of this(140,6)(245,6)(979,6)reason for his(889,6)v(129,7)follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a(984,6)Mrs. Younge, who was(279,6)time ago governess to Miss Darcy(684,6)(213,9)dismissed from her charge o(360,7)cause of disapprobation,(723,7)(987,7)e di(953,6)say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,(987,6)and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.(985,6)(280,6) was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham(462,6)he(985,6)went to her(851,6)ntelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But(987,6)it(933,6)wo or thre(700,7)(692,10)could get(389,10)what(140,10)anted(337,6)(807,7)ot betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery(350,10)corrup(450,6)for she really did know where(250,6)rie(559,6) to b(284,7)found.(312,8), indeed, had gone(312,8)on their first arrival in(993,6)London(375,7)ad she(992,6)(960,7) receive them in(398,7)house, the(215,7)(275,6)have taken up(120,7)abode(485,6)her.

He saw(292,10)and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia(707,7)His(309,7)object(196,9), he acknowledg(374,8)been to persuad(708,7)her to quit her present disgraceful situ(977,7)and return(761,7)(494,7)riends(749,12)they(694,7)be prevail(205,6)(439,11)her(983,7)offering his assistance as far as it(730,7)go. But he(615,6)(279,6)(704,7)bsolutely resolv(320,6)remaining(697,7)she was(816,6)cared for non(988,7)of(733,11)s;(49,7)nted no help(994,6)(27,8)(883,9)hear of(985,6)leaving(775,8)(927,7)as sure(291,6)sh(292,8)married some time o(631,7)other(544,6)it di(989,6)much signify when. Since such(631,6)(417,10)eelings, it only(274,7)ed, he thought, to secure and expedite (349,7)marriage, which, in his very(961,7)conversation(854,6)(735,9)h(627,7)easily learnt had never(984,6)_his_ design. He confessed himsel(346,7)obliged to leave the regiment on account of(337,6)debts of hon(976,9)whi(299,8)very pressing; and scruple(472,6)to lay all the ill(973,6)consequences of(931,6)’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to(975,6)resig(335,6)commission immediately(148,6)as to his future(925,11)(977,8)(886,7)conjectu(220,8)little about it(131,6)ust go somewhere, but(73,9)(618,8)know(825,6)(645,6)he knew he(703,8)have nothing to liv(841,8)n. Mr. Darcy asked why(95,12)marry your sister at once.(980,6)Though Mr. Bennet was not imagin(519,6)b(452,7)rich, (916,9)ha(138,8)been able to d(245,6)(177,6)for him(221,7)is(341,10)(290,6)have been(73,8)nefited by(788,9). But he found, in reply to this ques(424,11)that(796,8) still cherished the hope of more effectually making(494,7)is fortune(141,12), in(759,6)other country. Under such(702,7)ircumstances, however(319,6)(356,7)like(199,6)be proof against t(979,8)tempt(1012,6)of(693,10) relief.

Everyth(348,9)being settled between _them_,(724,10)’s next step w(928,6)mak(767,7)your uncle acquainted with it(846,9)first called in Gracechur(424,8)Street the evening before I came hom(643,7)Mr. Gardin(505,6)ld no(980,7)be seen; and(918,11)(691,7)on further inquiry,(679,6)your father(425,10)(692,6)with(828,6)but(883,7)quit town the(285,6)morning.

On Saturday he(497,6)again. Y(314,11)was gone, you(426,7)(635,7)t hom(280,6), as I said(580,7), they had a great deal of talk(995,7)ogether(973,11)again on Sunday(374,9)n _I_ saw him too.

I(993,6)fancy, Lizz(746,8)(37,7)cy is the real defect of his character(500,8)fter all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;(924,7)ut _this_(124,8)true one. Nothing was(800,7)done(925,6)h(659,9)(996,6)do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it(884,7)thanked(715,7)(831,10)say n(130,7)about it)(879,11)(1015,7)most(875,9)have(998,6)(487,8)the whole(578,7)ba(511,6)it(604,9) for a long time, which(571,10)mor(167,6) eith(941,7)(837,10)or lady concerned in i(280,8)eserved(547,6)at last(198,13)as forced to yield(723,6)instea(921,8)f being allow(44,6)be of use to his niece,(82,15)put up(776,7)ith on(297,6)ing the probable credit of it(260,7) went sorely(631,7)gainst(259,6)rain; (477,6)really believe(424,6)letter this morning(983,6)gave him(1016,7)pleasure, because it required an explanation tha(983,8)ould rob him(808,8)borrowed feathers(334,6)give(239,7)aise wher(555,7)(1008,6) due.

The reason why all(540,6)was(721,7)done by him(624,7)lon(724,7)such as I have given above. I(452,6)owing(783,6)m,(791,7)(968,6)r(904,6) and want of proper(292,10)tion, that Wickham’s charact(282,8)had(434,6)so misunderstoo(949,7)consequently(74,6)he(52,9)(138,8)ceived and noticed as he was. Perhaps there(249,6)ome truth i(69,7)_this_; though I doubt whether _his_(244,8), or _anybody’s_(273,14)can be answerable(642,9)event. But in spite of(438,9)(687,7)ine talking, my dear(834,8)you may rest perfectly assured(970,11)your uncle(981,7)never(488,6)yielded, if w(333,6)not(511,7)him credi(73,7)f(235,6)other interest_ in the affair. When(638,14)resolved(971,6)on, he returned agai(768,6)is friends, who were still staying (212,8)Pemberley; but i(674,6)agre(251,7) he should be in London once more(975,6)whe(190,6)wedd(735,6)ok place(885,6)all money matters(150,6)then to(629,13) the last finish.

The contents of(867,6)letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether(815,6)ure or pain bore the

was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt
that even her vanity was insufficient, when requi(856,7)depend on his

and, before she(793,7)strike into another path,(570,9)overtaken by
Wickham.

“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,
as he join(450,7)

“You certainly do,” she repli(430,8)a smile; “(518,7)does not follow
tha(653,6)(156,9)ion must be unwelcome.”

“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,
and now we ar(773,8).”

“True. Are the others coming out?(132,6)do not know. Mrs. Benne(488,6)Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so(374,16), I find,(582,6)ou(703,8)and aunt,(1021,6)you have actually seen Pemberley.”(663,6)(399,8)(138,7)affirmative(544,7)lmost envy you th(896,12)and yet I believe it w(389,8)too much

“Ye(90,7)did.”

“And what did she say?”

“That you(617,6)gon(927,7)the army(315,6)(165,9)(898,6)had--not turned

misrepresente(184,6)C(920,8),” (916,10), biting his lips. Elizabeth hope(228,6)had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--

“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each(877,6)
several times. I wonder(386,6)he can be doing there.”

“Perhaps preparing for his m(888,8)with Miss de Bourgh,” said
(258,9). “It must be something particular to(723,6)him(128,6) at this
time of year.”

“Undoubtedly. Di(744,7)e(60,6)while(575,10)at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners t(643,8)ha(685,6)Yes; he introduced us to his siste(155,6)And do you like her?”

“Very much.”

“I have heard, indeed,(117,6)she is uncommonly improved within this year

“How shoul(679,6)have(365,7)making sermons?”

“Exceedingly(366,6) I(61,8)have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion(170,7)soon(629,6)been nothing. One(278,7)not to repine; but,
to be sure, i(245,13)been such a (971,6)for me! The quiet, the
retirement of(50,8)life,(324,12)answered all my ideas of
happiness! But it(724,9)to be(1023,10)ever hear Darcy(535,9)the

They(633,6)now almost(529,8)door(529,8)house, for she had w(75,6)fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling(58,6)her sister’s sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--

“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and(125,7)(640,6)know. Do not let us
quarrel abou(789,6)past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind.”

She held out her hand: he kisse(495,6)ith affectionate gallantry,(983,7)

(348,11)(1015,7) perfectly satisfied(425,6)this conversation(971,7)he
(834,6)again distressed himself, or(529,8)d his dea(565,8) Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject(732,6)(640,6)she was pleased to fi(942,8)she
had(618,6)enough to keep him quiet.

The day(729,6)s and Lydia’s departure soon came(761,6)Mrs. Bennet was
forc(128,6)submit to a sepa(412,6), which, as(556,6)usband by no means
(484,8)into(843,6)cheme(930,7)ir all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

“Oh, my(379,6)Lydia,” she cried, “when(767,7)we meet(465,6)?”(61,7)Lord! I don’t(874,7)Not these two or three years, perhaps.”

“Write to me very often(147,9).”

“As(22,6) as I can. But(985,9) married women have (634,6)much time for
writing. My(613,7)s may w(131,8)_me_. They will(74,7)othing else to
do.”(801,13)’s adieus were(116,6)more(1004,14)than his wife’s. He
smiled, lo(770,6)andsome(1003,6)said many pretty things.

“He is as fine a fellow,”(734,6)Mr(654,8), as(685,6)as they(162,6)out of
the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers(140,7)mirk(12,7)makes love to us
all. I am prodigiously proud(840,6)m. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a(324,6)valuable son-in-law.”(935,6)loss of her daughter made(913,13)very dull for several days.

“I(601,7)think(321,8)she, “that there is(518,9)so bad as parting with
one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”

“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a(236,9)(496,7)
Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single.”

“It(243,6) such(632,6). Lydia does not leave me because she is(908,8);
but only(33,9)her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not(1008,6)gone so soon.”

B(361,6) spiritless condition whi(216,6)s event threw her into was shortly
relieved(917,6)her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news(128,9)en began(252,7)in circulation. T(929,8)keeper
at Netherfield had received orders(833,6)epare for(150,6)rrival(810,7)
master, wh(232,6)coming down in a day or two, to shoo(776,8)(834,11)
weeks.(875,13)was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
smil(347,8)shook(549,6)ead, by turns.

“Well, well(44,7)o Mr. Bingley i(199,13), sis(800,6)(for Mrs.
Philips first brought he(292,6)news). (104,7)so m(761,6)e(832,7). Not that
I care about it, though. He(821,6)thing to us(970,6)know(574,6)I am sure I
never want to see him(592,6). But, however, (857,6)very welcome to (8,7)
(531,11), if he likes it. And who knows what _may_(886,7)? (808,6)at
(188,16). Y(188,9)(336,7) we agreed long ago (199,6)to mention
a word(288,9)(131,6)so, it i(544,8)certain(218,7)(643,6)?”

“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “(475,8) Nichols was in
Meryton last night: I sa(992,6)passing by(977,6)went out myself on purpose
t(311,6) the truth of it;(686,7)e told me that i(768,6)(218,7)ly true. He

Miss(1023,8)had not been able to hear of h(932,10)without changing
colour. I(323,6)many months since(161,7)d(612,8)ed his na(769,6)Elizabeth; but (878,6)s soon as they were alone toge(579,6)she said,--

“(548,6)you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt(511,6)us of the present
repor(550,7)I(578,6)I appeared distressed(174,6)don’t imagine(581,8)from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I fel(986,7)I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you(712,6)the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing,(799,6)he comes
alone;(169,9)we shall see(783,6)ess(561,6)m. No(196,6)(92,6)afraid of
_(942,6)_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”
(547,10) di(677,6)know what to make(989,6). Ha(989,6)not seen him in
Derbyshire(881,6)might have supposed him capab(828,6)(752,7)there(309,6)no

“Yet it is hard,”(869,6)ometimes(201,8), “(621,7)is poor man cannot(86,6)to a house, which he has legally hired, (126,8)raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”

In spite of(534,6)her sister declared(362,6)really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation(375,8)arrival, (658,10)could easily
perceive(821,8)r spirits were(907,7)ed by it. They(26,6)more disturbed,
more unequal,(618,6)she had often(732,6)them.

The subject(365,8)ad been so warmly canvassed betw(62,7)ir parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now br(710,6)forward again.

“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you
will wait on him,(898,6)urse.”

“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year(857,6)promised, if I
went to see(101,6)he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing(955,6)I will not be sent on a fool’s erran(300,8)”

His wife represent(645,6)him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from(822,7)e neighbouring gentlemen,(339,6)s returning to
Netherfield.

“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise(439,8)he. “If he wants our society, let
him seek it. He knows where we live.(307,12)spend _my_ hours in
running after my(215,10)(608,6)y time they go away and come back

(661,6). But, however(73,7)shan’t prevent my ask(655,8)to dine here, I
am determined. We must have(789,6)Long and the Goulding(864,6). Tha(182,6)
make thirteen with ourselves, so t(371,6)(226,7)just room at table for
him.”

Consoled by t(553,6)solution, she was the better able to bear her
husband’s incivility; though it was very mortify(643,6)(401,6)that her
(486,11)might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. A(179,6)day of his arrival drew near,--

“I begin(209,6) sorry(149,8) comes at all(773,8)Jane to her sister. “It(915,10)nothing; I could see him(423,6)perfect indifference; but I can
hardly(348,6)to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can(17,7)how much I suffer from w(732,6)e
says. Happy sh(843,6)be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”

“I wish(269,10)ay anyth(517,7)comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it
is wholly out of my power. You(840,6)feel it;(834,9)usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a(256,7)er is denied me, because you have
always so much.”

(676,11)(616,6)ed.(977,6)Bennet, through the assista(705,7)servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings(757,8)that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on(687,7)de be as long as it(677,6). She counte(315,6)days
that(347,6)intervene(877,7) their invitation(749,7)be sent--hopeless of
seeing him(939,7). But on the third morning after(945,13)in
Hertfordshire, she saw him(686,6)her dressing-room window enter the
paddock, and ride towards the house.

Her daughters were eagerly call(411,6)partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place (427,7)tabl(1007,7)(739,9), to(675,7)y her(973,7), went
to the(207,7)--she looked(12,6)saw Mr. Darcy with him(229,6)sat down
again b(94,6)sister.

“There is a gentleman(67,11)mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”

“Some acquain(724,7)r (194,7)my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.”

“La!” replie(115,7), “it looks just like(763,6)man(772,6)us(818,6)be with
(615,12)Mr. what’s his name--(826,6)all, proud man.”

“Good gracious!(345,10)!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here,(182,7)sur(533,7)else I must
say(996,6)I hate the very sight of him.”

Jan(533,8) a(601,11)(527,6)surprise and concern(1006,6)knew but little
of(981,7)meeting in Derby(886,7)and ther(1024,6)felt for the awkwardness
which must attend(631,11), in seeing him almos(71,10)first time
after receiv(46,6)s explanatory letter. Both(724,7)(944,7)uncomfortable
enough. Each(180,14)(870,7)and of course(209,8)mselves;(244,8)ir
(918,6) talked on(1022,8)dislike of(905,10)(896,6)her resolution(674,6)

suspected by Jan(662,6)whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.
Gardiner’s(410,7), or to relate her own change of sentiment towards
him. To(133,7)he(172,7)be(296,7) man whose proposals(164,9)refused,
and(37,7)merit(34,10)undervalued(877,6)to(151,9)more extensive
information, he was the pers(458,6)whom the whole family(640,6)indebted
(726,14)of benefits(843,6)(355,9)regarded herself(952,6)an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonabl(1003,6)just, as
what Jan(947,11)(620,7). Her astonishment at his coming--(15,6)
(15,6) to Netherfield, to Longbourn(841,6)voluntarily seek(697,6)r again,
was(1011,8)equal(618,6)at(618,9)known on(308,7)witness(1024,8)altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.

The colour(751,7)had been driven from her face returned for half a
minute(388,8) additional glow(986,6)a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, a(677,6)though(384,6)that space of time(19,6)his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken(711,6)she w(982,9)be secure.

“Let m(641,8)see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
enough for expectation.”

She sat intently at work, striv(561,7)be composed(759,7)ithout dar(596,6)

sister (941,7)servant was approaching the door.(789,6)looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate(28,6)Elizabet(611,6)(283,6)ed. On the
gentlemen’s appearing, her(672,8)increased; ye(770,6)receiv(225,8)with
tolerable ease(322,10) a propriety of(466,6)iour(857,6)ly free(751,6)any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.

again to her(552,7)(868,8)eagerness(949,7)it di(719,6)often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. H(475,9)serious as(466,6); and,
(917,11),(480,6)as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire,(547,6)as
s(52,7)seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he c(940,9)in her
mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. I(736,7)
painfu(686,7)not an improbable, conjecture.

Bingley (187,8)likewise(196,6)for an instant(950,6)in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. H(205,6)(741,9)by Mrs.
Bennet(726,8)degree of(596,11)hich mad(259,6)two daughters ashamed,
especially when contraste(817,7)the col(153,6)ceremonious politeness of
(930,6)urtesy(360,6)ddr(28,6) his friend(793,13)particularly, who knew(304,6)her (480,6) ow(591,6)the latter the
preservation of her favourite(233,9)(970,6)irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distres(698,7)a most (540,7)(348,8)by a distinction so ill
applied.

Darcy, after inquiring(158,8)how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question
(975,6)s(757,13)answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He
was not seat(571,6)her:(855,8)(667,6)was the reas(331,7)is silence; but
it ha(892,6)bee(249,6)n Derbyshire. There (978,7)talk(436,6)her(506,7)s
when(968,14)(33,6)self. But now several minutes elapsed,(249,8)
bringing the sound(611,8)voice; and(714,6)occasionally, unable to resist
the impuls(823,6)uriosity, she raised her eyes to(711,6)ace(33,6)as often
found(976,13)at Jane as (715,6)self, and frequently on no object bu(145,6)ground. More thoughtfulness and l(9,6)xiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly exp(741,6). She was disappointed(163,6)angry
with(414,8) for being so.

“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” (662,6)he. “Yet why did(513,6)me?”

(131,8)in no humour for convers(987,6)with anyone but himself(488,6)to
him s(633,7)hardly courage to speak.(108,6)(913,6)ed(928,7)(742,6)ster, but(875,7)do no more.

“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,(251,7)Mrs. Bennet.

He readily agre(798,6)it.

“I began(323,7)afraid(83,6)(1020,6)ever come back again. People _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is(929,6)rue. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
(285,19). Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my
own daughters. I suppos(374,6)(134,6)eard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it(168,8)pap(77,6)t(641,8)the ‘Times’(601,6)he ‘Courier,’ I know;

(259,7)my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came
to make such an awkward business(415,6). D(732,7)see it?”

(844,7) replied that he did(112,6)made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,(334,6)fore, she(1021,6)
not tell(1019,12)delightful thing,(937,7)sure, to(778,6)a(676,9) well(729,8),”
continued her mother; “but a(931,6)same time, Mr. (273,7), (904,6)very
hard(108,9)her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a
(530,6)quite northward it seems(480,6)(616,6)t(77,8)to stay, I do not
know how long. His regiment is(680,6); for(941,28)
his leaving the ----shire(614,6)of his(751,7)gone into the Regulars.
Thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, (948,6), perhaps, not so many as he
deserves.”

(597,9), who knew this(503,7)levelled at(598,10), was in(767,6)misery
of shame(722,6)(613,9) hardly kee(678,6)seat. It drew(462,6)her, however,
the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done
before; and she asked(620,8) whether he meant (976,8)any stay in the
country at present. A few weeks, he believed.

“When(509,10)ki(315,6)ll your own birds(762,14)” sai(816,12),
“I beg you will come here(209,7)oot as(468,9)you please on Mr.
Bennet’s manor. I am sure he(83,6)be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the coveys for you(588,13)’s(534,7) increas(577,6)such unnecessary,(577,6)officious
attention! W(918,7) same fair prospect to arise(407,11), as had
flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be
hastening (898,7)same vexatious conclusion. At(752,6)instan(760,6)felt,
that years of happiness(790,7)not(626,6)Jane or herself amends for
moments of(873,6)painful conf(127,6)

“The first wish of my heart(600,8)she to(97,8), “is never more(1000,6)

o(274,6)the other again!”

Yet the(605,7), for which(361,20)we(222,6)offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much(785,7)auty of her sister rekindl(644,6) admiration(39,8)former
lover. When(451,7)he came in, he had spoken(449,7) but little, but(723,6)
five minutes seemed(471,6) giving h(493,8)of his (872,9). He found her
as handsome as s(132,7)been las(720,6); as good-natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty.(756,6)was anxious(835,6)no

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful(578,7)
intended civility(349,6)they(721,6)invited and(172,8) to dine at
Longbourn in a few days’ time.

“You are(405,7)a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “(879,6)en
you went to tow(541,7)winter, you promis(648,6)take a family dinner with
us as(897,7)s you returned. I have not forgot(89,6)see; and I assure you
I was very(923,6)disappointed(606,6)you(458,9)come back and keep your

(260,7) looked a(889,7) silly at this reflection(775,6)said something of
his concern at having(852,6)prevented by business. They then(357,6)away.

not think any(233,6)less than two courses c(965,8)good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.

CHAPTER LIV.(72,16)]

A(709,10)(938,10)gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects
which must deaden(523,6)more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed
her.

“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave(766,6)indifferent,”(780,7)he,
“did he(890,6)at all?”

She(547,7)settle it in no way(952,6)gave her pleasure.

“H(55,8)be still ami(675,7)till(45,6)ing to my uncl(560,6)aunt, when he
was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why(195,6)hither(33,7)
no longer cares for(47,9)(293,6)? T(145,6), t(154,7)man! I will(844,6)
no more about him.”

Her resolution wa(95,6)a short time involuntarily(957,6)b(812,9)roach
of(618,6)ister, who joined her with a cheerful(769,6)(585,6)show(38,6)
bette(908,8)ied(55,6)their visitors than(757,10).

“Now(524,12) “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength(633,6)I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It(416,8)en be publicly
seen,(673,6)on both sides we meet(807,6)as common(796,16)
acquaintance.”

“Yes, very(835,13) indeed(843,8)(343,9), laughingly. “Oh, Jane!
take car(85,6)My dear Lizzy, you cannot(625,6) me so weak as(981,7)in danger now.”

“I(46,7)you are in(169,6)great(45,8)of making him as much in love with
you as ever.”

They did not see the gentlemen(436,7)till(399,8)(930,6)Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to a(448,6) happy schemes(733,7)the
good-humour and(434,8)politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s(762,6),
had revived.

O(581,9) there was a large party assembled at Longbourn(229,6)the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of(911,7)punctuality as
sportsmen,(79,6)(451,9)ood time. When they repaired(92,7)

the place(382,6), in(414,8)ir former parties, had belong(139,6)him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself. On entering the (253,6)he seemed to
hesitate; but Jan(611,6)en(314,6)look round, and(28,13)smile: it was

uneasy, the period which passed i(103,6)drawing-room befor(558,6)gentlemen
came, was wearisome and dull to a degree(472,6)(1015,7)made (463,6)civil.
She looked forwar(534,6)heir(194,9) (748,6) point on(178,7)all her

“If he doe(967,6)come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for
ever.”

T(281,12) came; (793,8)thought (231,10)as if (820,8) have
answered her(688,6); but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and(966,10) pouring ou(795,6)coffee,

“The men shan’(502,7)and part us, I am determined. We want n(135,6) them;

to help anybody to(468,8) a(555,6)n was enraged against herself for
being so silly!

“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish(154,7) to

some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering
to Elizabeth(884,6), he walked away.

Bingley’s(206,6)iour to Jane to be convinc(670,8)she would get him at
last(734,6)her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were(905,6)r beyond reason,(132,11)as quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

“It has been a(499,6)agreeable day,”(765,6)Miss(675,7) to Elizabeth. “The
party seemed so(954,6)selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet(204,6).”

CHAPTER LV.(83,16)]

A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again(704,7)lone. His
friend had left him(859,6)morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour(838,6)was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited(159,6)o dine(93,10); but,(109,6)many
expressions of concern, he conf(1004,6)himself engaged elsewhere.

“Next time you cal(930,9)she, “I hope we shall be(745,6)lucky.”

He(805,8)be particularly happy at any time, etc.(6,6)(645,9)she
would give him leave, (22,6)take an early opportunity of waiting on
them.

“Can(203,6)ome to-morrow?”

Yes, he had no(271,7)ment at all for(50,10)(806,6)her(403,6)a(949,6)as
accepted(500,6)alacrity.

He came(634,6)in such very good(258,7)that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran(542,13)to her daughters’ room, in her(59,6)ing-gow(770,7)with her hair half finished, crying out,--

“M(944,6) Jane,(1019,6)haste(267,6)urry down. He is come--(898,12)is
co(791,7)is, indeed. M(75,9)(87,12). Here, Sarah,(434,8) Miss

“We wi(708,6)down as soon as we can(763,8)Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs(377,6)an hour ago.”

“Oh! hang(90,6)! what has she to do(1019,6)it? Come, be quick(10,10)!
where is your sash, m(457,6)?”

But when her mother was gone, Jane(873,7)not be prevailed on to go down
without (683,7)her sisters.

The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr(763,9)retired to(831,6)ibrary, a(83,6)his
custom(896,6)Mary(388,15)(829,7)instrument. Two obstacles(898,7)

impression on them. (88,10)(433,10)observe her;(1008,6)hen at last
(690,6)did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do
you keep(231,11) me for(36,7)am I(691,6)?”

“Nothing, child, n(16,6). I di(619,6)wink at you.” She then sat still(391,6)minutes longer; but un(316,6)o waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up(542,6)saying to(981,6),--

“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out(569,7) room.
Jane instantly gave a look at(453,12)hich spoke her distress at such
premeditation(726,6)her entreaty that _she_(962,11)give in to it. In a

soon as she was in the hall. “(760,6)and I are going upstairs to sit in

daughter. His eas(215,6)cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable
addition (226,6)ir evening party;(750,7) bore(606,6)the ill-judged
officiousness(897,8)(398,8)(811,6)ard all her silly remarks(687,6)a

means, for his coming next morning to shoot(718,10)husband.

Afte(591,10), Jane(904,6)no more(523,7) indifference. Not a word passed
betwee(926,6)sisters conce(132,6)(662,7); but (890,10)went to bed(987,7)
happy belief(694,6)all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy

(476,10)ge(780,7)s had been(896,6)d on. The latter was much more
(932,9) than(573,8)panion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in(486,8)(439,6)could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence(252,9)was(642,6)communicative(1013,6)less eccentric,(195,6)the
other had ever seen him.(155,9)(1012,6)rse (550,13) him to dinner;
an(657,8) evening(888,14) invention was again at work to get
everybody away from him(476,7)r daughter.(785,10), who had a letter to
write,(813,6)into the breakfast-room for(814,6)purpose soon a(991,6)ea; for
as the others were all go(587,6) sit down to cards(791,6)(458,6)not be
wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.

But on her(366,7)(104,7)the drawing-room, whe(40,6)(246,7)was finished,
she saw, to her infinite surprise, t(680,9)reason to fea(277,7)her
(160,6)(805,10)too ingenious for her. On op(498,6)the door, she

_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllabl(994,6)uttered by
either(1024,6)(786,9) was o(906,6)point of(689,7)away(890,6)(576,6)
(996,7)(837,6)as well(279,7)(756,6) had sa(741,6), suddenly rose, and,
whispering a few words(633,8)(502,6), ran out of the room.

pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion,(773,6)sh(801,6)the happiest creature i(356,6)world.

“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far(30,9). I do not d(240,6) it. Oh,
why is not everybody as happy?”

(489,9)’s congratulations were given(221,6)a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which(435,7)(393,6)but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness(734,6) fresh source of(302,6)ness to Jane. Bu(337,7)ould not
allow herself to stay(406,6)(571,12)or say half(407,6)remain(997,6)be

happiest, wisest(370,6)most reasonable end!”

In a few minutes(933,6)as joined by Bingley, whose conferenc(786,10)

“Where is you(999,8)?(299,7)he hastily, as he opened the door.

to(673,6)(24,9)say of his own happiness(973,6)of Jane’s per(269,7)s;

Jane(846,6)a general similarity(159,6)el(77,8)taste between her and
himself.

It was an evening of no common (531,8)(834,6)m all; the satisfa(628,8)
Miss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation(732,7) face, as
made her l(599,9)omer th(162,6)r. Kitty simpered(306,6)miled(520,6)hoped
her turn was(843,8)soon. Mrs.(169,7) could not giv(120,6)consent, or
speak(308,6)pprob(179,6)in terms warm enough(671,6)tisfy(208,6)(386,6)s,
though she talked to Bingley(363,6)thing else, for half an hour(829,6)when
Mr(183,9)joined(401,7)t supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how(742,8)happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allus(443,7)it(980,7)their
visitor took(52,6)eave for the night; but as soon as(129,7) gone, he
turn(294,6)his daught(694,6) said,--

“(772,6)I congratulate you. You will be a ver(233,8)woman.”

Jane went(100,6)m instantly, ki(240,7)m(866,6)thank(17,6)(412,6)is
goodness.

“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in
thinking y(183,11)so happily settled.(66,8)not a doubt of your
doing(234,6)well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike(305,6)are
each(84,7) so complying, that(680,9)will ever be resolved on; so

“I hop(268,6)so. Imprudence or (880,6)tlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in _me_.”

“E(119,6)thei(120,8)! My dear (903,10),” cri(798,7)wife, “what are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year(631,6)very likely
more.” Then addressing her(797,9), “Oh, m(163,6),(169,6)(803,8)am so
happy!(15,7)ure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all(942,6). I knew how it
(317,8). I (421,7)said it must(702,6), at last. I was(113,6)you could not

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At(917,6)moment she cared(327,7) o(1024,6)Her(160,6)er
sister(333,7)began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary (204,8)(160,7)the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begge(789,7)har(230,6)a few balls there every winter.

Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast(945,6)(780,7)remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who(807,10) be enough
detested, had given him an invitation(382,6)nner, (427,6)he(756,8)
himself obliged to accept.

Elizabeth had now but little time for convers(107,6)(557,9)(602,6); for
while h(718,6)present(735,6)(88,6) atten(171,8)bestow on anyone else: but
she found herself considerably useful to both(587,7)m, in those hours of
separ(285,7)hat must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he(475,7)
attached (327,8)to (310,10)(728,8)pleasur(733,6)alking of her; and
when (666,7) was gone,(290,6)constantly sought the same means of relief.

“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me(269,6)he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I(552,7)t believed
it possible.”

“I suspected as much,” replied(315,10). “But how did he account for
it?”

“I(440,7)have been his(633,7)s’ doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance(709,6)me(814,8)I cannot wonder at, since he migh(131,6)
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But(1021,6)they see,
as I trust(21,6)will,(680,6)their brother is(479,6)(177,10)(48,9)
lear(847,7) contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we
can never be what we once(338,6)to each other.”

“That is the most unforgiving speech(653,8)(808,9), “that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you(197,6)
the dupe of Miss(864,8)’s pretended regard.”

“Woul(118,6)(700,7) it, Lizzy(380,7)when he went to(768,11)November he

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane o(893,6)diffidenc(249,6)

“I am certainly(817,10)fortunate creature(1019,6)ever existed!” cried
Jane. “Oh(683,9)why am I thus singled(425,6)my family(661,6)blessed

CHAPTER LVI.(34,19)One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagemen(574,7)Jane(176,9)

sound of a carriage;(149,8)y perceived a chais(177,6)four driving up the
lawn. I(692,6)too ear(505,9)(313,8) for visitors(104,6)besides, the

were post(203,6)neither the(229,9), no(18,6)liver(84,8) servant who
preceded it,(757,6)familia(145,7)em. As i(936,6)certain, however, that
somebody(36,6)oming,(556,8) instantly prevailed on Miss(878,7) to avoid
the confin(603,6)of such an intru(986,6)and walk away(639,6)him in(510,6)
shrubbery. They both set off(505,9) conjectur(658,10)remaining three
continued,(975,8)with little satisfaction, till the door(545,6)hrown
ope(180,7)(704,6)(539,7) entered(592,9)Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

The(808,7)of course all intend(824,6) be surprised: but(816,6)

(423,7)and Kitty(271,9)she was perfectly unkno(905,9)m, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She(274,8)(395,6)oom(475,6)an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to(103,10)’s salu(233,6)(71,6)a slight inclin(26,6)(886,6)
head(616,6)sat down without saying a word.(201,11)had mentioned her
name to her m(154,6)on her Ladyship’s entrance(611,9)no request of
introduction had been made.

Mrs.(836,7), all amazement(689,9)flat(342,6)by hav(188,6)g(95,7) such
high import(138,6)receiv(198,6)(864,6)the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly,(418,13),--

“I hope you are well, Miss(231,7). That lady, I suppose, is your
(359,6)?”

(610,10)replied(124,6)concisely that(705,8).

“And _that_(90,16)one of your sisters?”

“Ye(634,6)am,” said (401,13)delighted to speak to a(1001,15).
“She is my youngest girl but one. M(26,11)of(1019,6)s lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking(867,7)(121,6) man,
who, I believe, will soon become a part(811,7) family.”

“You have a(488,7)mall park here,” returned(260,15), after a
short(569,8).

“It is nothing in comparis(941,6)Rosings, my L(533,7)dare say; but, I
assure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”

“This must be a most inconvenient(764,8)-room for the even(175,6)
summer: the windows are full west.”(968,13) (173,6)(891,6)that they never s(15,6)re(304,7)dinner; and then
added(842,6)May I take the liberty of asking(719,6)Ladyship whether you left Mr. and(156,6)Collins well(763,10)very well. I saw them the night before la(230,6)(914,10)now expected(904,11)ould produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive(62,9)calling. But no

refreshment: but(775,15)(822,6)resolutely(149,6)not(847,6)politely,
declined eating anything(522,10), rising up, said to (385,9)(546,7)iss(209,9)(599,6)(334,8)o(751,6)prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of(600,6)lawn. I should be glad(270,9)a turn in it, if you
will favour me(355,6)your(1011,6)ny.”

“Go, my dear,” cri(811,7)mother, “(456,6)ow(391,14)about the
different walks. I think(643,6)ill be pleased(487,6)the hermitage(713,14)obeyed; and, run(1014,7)to her own room(707,9)parasol,

“How could I ever(727,7)her like(619,6)ephew?” said she, as she looked in
her face.

As soon a(650,7)enter(611,7)copse, (644,15)began in the following
manner:--

“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understan(722,6)reason of my
journey hither. You(878,6)heart, y(16,8)conscience, must tell you why I
com(978,15)(264,7)with unaffected astonishment.

“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account
for(977,6)onour of seeing you here.”

“(284,12)” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to
kno(863,7)I am not(970,6) trifl(243,7). But however insincere _you_ may
choose(59,6)(255,6)shall not find _me_ so. My character has(661,6)been
celebrated for its (106,6)ity and frankness; and in a cause of such
moment(666,6)is, I(136,7)certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told,(328,6)not only your
sister was o(767,6)point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_--that(787,6)(667,10)(797,6) would(496,6)ll likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my(1022,7)--my own(15,7), Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it(823,6)be a scandalous false(117,6)t(51,7)(152,6) not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
setting off (820,6)is place(397,7)I might make my sentiments known to
you.”

“If you believed it im(132,8)(790,9)ue,” said(387,10), colouring
with astonish(652,6)nd disdain, “I wonder you took(246,7)ouble of coming
so far. What could you(986,10) propose by it?”

“At once to insist upon having such a(745,8)universally contradicted.”

“Your(136,7) to Longbourn, to see me and my family(274,17)
coolly, “will be rather a confirmation(488,6)--if, indeed,(168,14)
is in existence(424,7)! do(321,6)hen pretend(418,7)ignora(866,6)it? Has i(918,6)been

“I never heard(645,6)it was.”

“And can you likewise declar(691,8)there is no _foundation_ for(491,8)I do not(252,12)possess equal frankness with(572,14). _You_
may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”

“This(164,6)t(794,7)borne. Miss Bennet(951,7)ist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?(671,9)(776,9)has(321,8)d i(142,8)(953,10)(987,6)t ough(172,8)so; it must(15,6), while he retains the use of his
reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a mome(647,7)nfatuation,
have(229,6)him forget what he owes to himself a(727,6)all his(878,7). You
may have drawn him in(800,7) I have, I(456,7)be the last person to confess it.”

“(443,13)(865,7)know who I am?(88,7)(845,9) accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitl(96,6)know(268,9)d(70,7)concern(863,6)But(572,6)r(165,6)(62,17)_mine_; nor will(978,6)behaviour as
this ever induce me(739,7)explic(302,7)Let me be rightly understood. This match, to(856,7)you(435,6)the
presumpti(396,6)aspire, can never take place. No,(22,6). Mr. Darcy is
engag(381,6)_my daughter_. Now,(599,7)av(849,6)to say?”

“Only this,--that if he is so, you can(492,8) (764,6)(482,6)ppose he will
make(937,10)to me.”

Lady Catherine hesitated for(794,9),(734,6)hen replied,--

“The (216,6)ment between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
the(801,7)been intend(131,7)each other. It wa(1007,6)favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While(699,7)ir cradles we planned the
union; and now, a(778,6)(265,6) wh(224,6) wishes of both sisters would be
accomplished, is(244,7)marriag(679,8)prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importanc(204,8)(903,7) and wholly unallied to

propriety and delicacy? H(762,8)not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destin(694,7)his cousin?”

“Yes(463,6)I had(93,7)it before. But(894,6)is(108,6)to me? If there is no
other objecti(867,6)my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be

an(347,6)choice? And if I am(508,6)(25,6)(63,6)ma(332,6)I accept him?”

“Because (147,6), decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss
Bennet(39,10); for do not expect(955,7)notic(953,6)his(866,7) or

Your alliance will be a disgrace;(696,7)am(30,7)never even be mentioned
by any of us.”

“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “Bu(247,6)wife of Mr.
(597,6)must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attach(622,7)er situation,(975,6)she(775,6), upon(132,6)hole,(116,6)no cause
to repine.”

“Obstinate, headstrong girl!(668,6)ashamed of you! Is this(338,6)gratitude
for my att(333,6)s to you last spring? Is nothing du(796,6)e on that
score? Let us sit down(1017,6)are to understand(713,6) (713,8)that I came

“_That_(726,6)make(716,6)Ladyship’s(522,10) at present more pitiable;
but it(795,6)(527,8)effect on _me_.”

“I(799,7)ot be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended,(515,6)e maternal
side,(373,6)the same noble line; an(53,10)father’s(48,7)respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their (998,7) on
both sides is splendid(201,14)tin(235,17) by the voice of
every member of their(177,8)ive houses; and what is to divide
them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without(219,6)y,
connections, o(227,9)(979,10)to be endured? B(564,6)must not, shall

equal.”

“True. You _are_(64,23). But(471,6)was(966,6)mother? Who
ar(987,7)uncles(688,6)unts? Do not imagine me ignorant(583,9)

“Whatever my (504,11) may be,” said Elizabeth, “i(442,7)(961,7)does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_(270,6)ell me, once for all, (223,7) engaged to him?”

T(908,6)(141,9)(559,10), for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine,(572,6)answered(727,6)question, she c(652,9)but say, after a
moment’s deliberation,--

“I am not.”

Lady (115,9) seemed pleased.

“And will you promise me never to enter into such an(279,7)ment?”

“I(65,6)make no(69,9)(494,6) kind.”

“Miss Bennet,(700,6)shocked(574,6)stonished. I expect(378,6)find a more

assurance I require.”(336,7)I certainly _never_(93,7)give it.(956,6)not to be intimidated into

character, if(401,7)ink I can be worked on by(903,6)persuasion(126,8)se.
How far your nephew might approve of(29,6)interference in _his_ affairs,
I cannot tell(568,6)(776,9)(733,10)no right to concern(888,12)
mine. I must beg, therefore,(762,8)mportuned no further on the
subject.”

“Not so hasty(295,9)please. I(409,7)y no means done. To all the

“You can _now_(989,6)nothing(605,9)to say,” she resentfully answered.(71,6)have insulted me, in every possible method(740,12) to return to
the house.”

And(116,6)ose as she spoke. Lady Catherin(34,8)lso, and they turned
back. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.(267,7)(257,7) reg(403,6)hen, for (154,6)nou(545,6)credit of(521,10)!

“It is well(281,6)refuse(505,8)to oblige me(32,12)(25,6)ey the

“Neither(146,7)nor(150,9)nor(150,10),” replied Elizabeth, “has any

In(265,6)manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of

Meryton, thought she might as well call on(992,8)(161,7) she had
nothing particular to say(773,7), Lizzy?(709,13)was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.

The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw(991,11)into c(722,9)be easily overcome; nor(34,7)she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady (840,9), it
appeared, had actually taken the troubl(367,7)is journey from Rosings
for(414,6)ole purpose of breaking of(996,6)(750,7)d engagement with Mr.

expect(736,6)of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. S(971,6) not herself forgotten to feel(235,6)the marriage of her

“F(21,15)! and what can _he_(829,6)to say?”

“Something(609,6)much(927,8)purpose, of course. He begins with

(584,12)lf expected Mr. Bingley to do, (670,7)able to bring(435,6)
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after(937,15)’s
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and,(92,8)Mrs. Bennet had time to
tell him of their having see(967,6)aunt, of which her(986,10)sat in
momentary dread,(273,8), who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
(126,6)all walking ou(872,10)agreed to.(203,13)was not in the
habit of(67,8), Mary(785,7)(1020,6)spare time, but the remaining five
set off togethe(481,11)and(183,7)however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them. They lagged behind, while (604,9), Kitty, and(562,8)ere to entertain each(102,6). Very (899,6) was said by either;(79,6) was
too much afraid(875,6)m to talk;(132,10)(72,6)ecretly forming a
desperate resolution(612,7)perhaps, he might be doing the same.

They walked towards the Lucases’, because(182,8)ish(568,6)call upon
Maria; and as(180,11)saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when(286,7)left them she went boldly on(682,6)him(697,6). Now was the(759,7) for her(279,11)(748,7)executed(176,6)(491,6)her courage was
high, she immediately said,--

“Mr.(521,6), I am a very selfish creature(562,6)for(369,7)ke of giving
relief to my own feelings care not how(542,6)I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thank(37,7) for your unexampled kindness(125,7)poor
sister. Ever since I have known it(16,8)been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it(90,7)to(1007,7)st
of my family I should(268,6)ave merely(305,8)gratitud(906,6)xpress.”

“I am sorry, exceedingly(19,7)” replie(972,7), in a tone of surprise
and emotion, “that(214,6)ave ever(264,6)informed of what ma(82,7)
mistaken light,(333,6)given you uneasiness. I di(231,6)think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little(710,7)trusted.”

“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me (229,11)d(487,6)(922,7)ed in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let (112,6)nk you again and(10,6),
(111,7)name of all(537,10),(851,7)at generous compassion which induced
you to take so(847,6)troubl(927,7)bear so many mortifications(105,8)e
(956,8)discovering them(623,6)f you _will_(213,7)me,” he(619,8), “let it be(915,9)self alone.
That the wish of giving happi(940,8)you might add force(830,8)other
(245,6)ments(263,7)led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_(893,6)_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I(614,8)
only of _you_.”

Elizabeth was to(393,7)embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her(490,6)nion added, “You are too(529,10)to trifle with me. (424,6)r
feelings are still(955,6)they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
affections and wishe(84,6)unchanged; but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever(315,13), (185,7) all(909,6)or(837,6) common awkwardnes(148,6)anxiety of
his situation, now(577,6)d he(650,6)to speak; and immediately,(472,7) not
very fluently, gave him to understand(925,6)her senti(657,6)had(35,6)gone
so material a (304,6) since the period to(975,7)he alluded, as to make
her receiv(488,7)gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
(867,10)(819,6)this reply produced was s(769,7)he had probably never
felt before(321,6)he expressed himself(489,6)e occasion as sensibly(433,6)s
warmly as a man violently in love can be suppo(826,7)do. Had (872,9)
been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how we(606,6)
(190,7)ion of heartfelt delight diffused ov(89,7)face became him: but
(572,7)she could not look(19,11)listen(312,9)told her of(756,8)s
which, in proving of(952,6)importance she w(544,6)him, mad(509,6)(941,9)

They walked on without knowing in(114,6)dir(1019,6). Ther(116,8)o much to
be(820,7)t, and fel(10,7)said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt(852,6)they were indebted for their(738,9)goo(875,7)standing
to the efforts of(278,6)unt, who _did_ call on him in (862,6)turn through
London(213,6)there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive(55,9)
subs(434,6)of her conversati(375,7)(715,10); dwelling emphatically (460,9)(681,14)the latter,(977,6),(203,8)Ladyship’s apprehension,
peculiarly denote(638,6)perverseness(926,7)surance, i(969,6)belief that
such a(272,6)ion must assist her endeavours to obtain(469,6)promise from
her nephew(191,6) _she_ had re(881,6)to give. But, unluckily for her
(233,8)(380,6)effect had been exactly contrariwise.

“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
(58,7) before. I knew enough of your disposi(767,8)be certain,(333,6)had you(178,6)absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”

(638,9) coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes(124,6)kno(237,11)
my _frankness_(235,6)lieve me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
abominably to(320,6)face, I c(235,9) no scruple in(67,13)to all
your(671,9)s.”

“What di(364,6)say of me(662,6)I did not deserve? For though your
accu(948,6)s were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
(214,6) at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence(253,6)e will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annex(898,6)that
evening(807,8)(566,9). “The conduct of neither, if strictly
examined,(137,6)be irreproachable; but since then we(492,6)both, I(932,6)
improved in civility.”

“(270,9)be so easily reconcil(200,6)(951,6). The recollection of what I
then said, of my(216,8), my manner(466,6)expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has(994,6)many months, in(72,8)bly painful to me. Your
(516,7), so well ap(905,7)I shall never forget: ‘Ha(739,6)beha(297,7)a

confess, before I was reas(736,6) enough(977,7)(99,6)ir justi(725,7)(51,6)certainly very far from expect(408,7)m to make so strong an

a wa(648,11)(639,8)believe it(336,6)(272,6)t m(740,7)devoid of every proper

all. I as(252,9)(184,7)have long(844,7)ost heartily ashamed of it.”

Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,”(280,6)he,--“did it _soon_(560,6)you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?”

She explained(289,6)its effects on her had been, and how gradually all
h(1013,6)mer prejudices(54,9) removed.

“I knew(234,11) “(463,6)(524,6)wrote must(189,6)you pain, but(956,7)
necessary. I hop(658,6)have destroyed the(352,9)There was one part,

preservation of my regard; but, though we(897,6)both reason(66,6)ink my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not,(413,7), quite so easily
changed as(971,6)implies.”

“When(520,9)that(805,7),” replied Darcy, “I(245,8)d myself perfectly

pretensions to please a woman(392,6)y of(1015,7)(31,6)d.”

“Had you then persuaded yourself(701,6)I should?”

“I(270,6)I had.(336,6)will(70,7)ink(202,7)vanity? I believ(86,6)(710,6)

“My manners must(496,11)in faul(394,7)not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive(560,6)but my spirits(610,6) often lead me
wrong. How you(142,11)hat(414,6)after _that_ evening!(352,6)t(611,7)(534,6)angry, perhaps,(597,16)y anger soon began to

“I am almost afraid of asking what(479,7)ou(216,6) me when we met at
Pemberley(628,6)blam(628,6)for coming?”

“No,(780,7), I felt nothing but surprise.”

CHAPTER LIX.(107,16)]

“My dear Lizzy, where can you have(837,6)walking to?” was a question
(977,6)(628,10)received(813,6)Jane as soon as she ent(512,7)e room(479,6)from (289,7) others when(341,6)sat down to table(590,6)had(425,9)say in

else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by(91,9) extraordinary. The
ac(181,9)d lovers talked and(841,8); the un(46,13)were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in(824,7)(852,11)verflows in mirth;
and(527,10), agitat(139,7)confused,(967,8)_knew_(430,6)(401,8)happy
than _felt_ herself(931,7)so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there(232,6)other evils before her(586,6)anticipated what would be felt in
the family(664,6)her situ(1024,6)became known:(604,9)aware(652,6)no one
liked him but Jane; and even fea(793,6)at with(780,12)it(890,6)

At nigh(372,6)opene(769,6)heart to Jane. Though(701,11)was very far(946,6)Miss Bennet’s general habits,(264,10)bsolutely incredulous here.

“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me: I know it(577,7)impossible.”

“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependenc(685,6)on you(758,6)I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet(102,8), I
am in earnest. I speak no(1023,6)but the truth. He still loves me, and we
are e(305,6).”

Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh(375,7)! it(373,10).(317,8)how much
you (642,7) him.”(448,7)know(166,9)of the matter. _That_ is all(966,7)forgot. Perhaps I
did(717,7)ways love him so well as I(310,6)w; but in such cases as these
a good memory is unpardonable(598,7)is the last time I(572,7)ever
remember it myself.”

seriously, assur(886,7)of its(467,7)

“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must(606,9)you,” cried
(962,6)“My dear, dear(857,6), I would,(336,6)congratulate you(349,6)are you

happy with him?(886,6)ere(32,7) no(654,6)(569,6)at. It is settled between us already(99,6)(744,7)(983,6)the happiest couple in the world. B(216,10) pleased, Jane?
Shall you like to have(608,6)a brother?”

“Very, very much. N(923,7)could give either Bingley or(583,7)(519,6)delight(144,6)we considered it, we talked(537,6) as impossible. And do you

marr(413,6)out affection. A(476,13)sure(473,10)feel w(487,8)ought
to do?”

“Oh, yes! You will only think I(61,6)_more_ than I(66,6) to do when I

“What(251,7) mean?(21,6)y,(776,8)confess(639,6)I(280,10)bett(238,7)(755,6)(409,7). I am

Let me know ever(393,7)(171,7)am to(29,6)(393,8)delay. Wi(664,7)tell me
how long you(677,6)loved(857,9)It has been coming on so gradually,(289,8)hardly(119,7)hen it began;
but I believe(352,8)date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley.”

Another entreat(968,7)she would be(338,8), however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. When convinced on(745,6)article, Miss Bennet had n(1011,6)
fur(840,6)o wish.

“Now(464,6)(909,6)happy,” said she, “for(620,14)s(38,6) as myself. I
always had a value for him. Wer(392,6)or(139,8) but his(757,6)of you, I

husband, there can be(979,6)(842,7)(44,9)self more dear to me. But,

of it to a(660,6), not to you.”

Elizabeth told her the motives of(604,6)ecrecy. She had(889,6)unwilling to
mention(353,8)(691,6)the unsettled state(83,8)own feeling(513,6)made
her equally avoi(67,6)na(265,6)hi(439,8):(469,8)(854,11)no longer

and half(131,6)ight spent i(839,6)ersation.

“Good gracious!” cried Mrs.(850,7), as(962,6)tood at a window(226,6)ext
morning, “if(924,6)disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our(664,6)(748,7)! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be(842,7)

epithet.

As soon as they entered,(856,8) looked (100,7)so expressively, and
shook hand(354,7)such warmth, as left no doubt(857,8)good information;(769,6)e(144,7)fterwards said aloud, “(739,13)have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way(711,7)to-day?”

“I advis(766,11)(585,6)(525,7)and Kitty,”(152,6)(883,13)“to walk
to Oakham Mount this (879,7). It is a nice long walk(689,6)(885,10)has
never seen the view.”

“It may do very well for the others,” replie(83,6)(923,7); “but I am
sure it will be too much for(228,6). Won’t it,(245,6)?”

Kitty own(635,8)she had ra(639,6)tay at home(203,8)professed a great
curiosity to see(223,9) from the(314,6)(966,6)(826,10)silently
consented. As she went upstairs to get ready,(422,12) followed her,
saying,--(508,6)m quite sorry,(502,8)that you(860,11)forced to(645,6)that
disagreeable man all to yourself; (381,6)hop(695,6)will not mind it(539,7)

looking at(406,6)s(317,7)a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where(87,9)sit(1014,6)ith Kitty; and, while
pretend(440,6) admir(994,6)work, said in a whisper, “Go to you(529,8); he
wants you i(769,6)(675,7).” S(543,9)ne directly.

H(595,9) was wal(281,6)bout the room, (305,8)grave and anxious.
“Lizzy,”(168,6)he, “what are you doing? A(15,7)out of(187,6)senses to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”

How earnestly di(530,6)then wish(752,6)her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spare(978,6)from

“Hav(596,6)any(180,7)objection(641,8)Elizabeth, “than(805,6)belief of my

“None at all. We all know him(670,6) a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but

“I do, I do like him,” she replied(474,7)tears in(670,6)yes; “I lo(404,7)
Indeed he has no improper pride(437,8)perfectly amiable. You do not

such terms.”

“Lizzy(414,8)her father, “I(836,6)given him my consent(614,8)the kind

Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnes(183,6)solemn(930,8)reply;
and, at length, by repeated assurances(498,6)Mr. Darcy was(894,8)the
object of her choice, by explaining(275,7)adual change(756,9)r
estimation(933,8)had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his(255,7)ion was not the work of a day, but had stood the test (961,6)y
months’ suspense, and enumer(134,6)with energy all his good qualities,
she did conquer her father’s incredulity(94,6)reconcile him(927,6)e
match.

“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I(651,6)no(536,6)to
say. If this b(678,6)case, he deserves you. I(987,7)(722,9)parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”

To complet(786,6)favourable impression, she then told him(752,6)(622,9)
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her(411,6)astonishment.

“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so,(741,7)did everything;
made up the match, g(1005,8)money, pai(592,6)fellow’s debts(577,6)got him

and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry(271,11) their own
way. I shall offer to pay(715,7)-morrow, he(213,6)ran(139,6)storm abou(957,6)lov(473,6)you(885,6)ther(54,7)be an en(261,6)(388,6)ter.”

H(577,7)recollecte(524,6)embarrassment a few days before on his reading
Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allow(118,6)
at last to go, saying, as she quitte(550,6)room, “If any(368,7)men come
for Mary or Kitty, se(275,6)m in, for I am quite at leisure.”

Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,(243,6)
half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own(205,7)she was able to join
the others(927,6)tolerable composure. E(604,10)was too recent for
gaiety,(679,8)(967,9)passed tranquilly away;(569,8)as no longer
an(700,7)material to be dreaded(626,9) comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

Whe(269,6)mother went up to her dressing-room at night(305,6)fo(575,10),
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat(578,7)still(888,6)un(449,7)
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could
comprehend w(26,8)heard, though not in general backward to credit what
was for the advantage of her(420,6)y, or(128,6)ca(418,7)he shape of a
lover to any of them. She began(842,6)ngth to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder(603,6)bless herself.

“Good gracious! Lor(37,8)me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have(328,7)t it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money,(454,6)jewels(13,7)carriages
(57,9)have! Jane’s is no(992,6)to it--(15,8)at all. I am so
pleased--so happy. Such a charm(962,6)n! so handsome! so tall!(229,7)
dear(225,8)pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he(266,6)overlook it. Dear,(410,6)Lizzy. A hous(627,6)own! Everything
that is(195,9)! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord!(833,6)(409,7)come of me? I shall go distracted.”

This was enough to prove(933,6)her approbation need not be doubted; and
Elizabeth, rejoicing(1000,7)uch an effusion was(991,6)(709,6)by(758,8),
soon went away. But(366,7) she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.

“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can(856,6) of(660,9)else. Ten

possession of (695,6)rmest affection(399,6)secure of her relations’
consent, there was still some(490,6)to be wished for(644,6)the (271,6)

“I admire all my three sons(341,7) highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,

as Jane’s.”

“Dearest Jane! who c(558,10)don(876,6) for her? But make a virtue of it

From an unwillingness to(503,8) how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been overrated(394,11)(288,6)ever yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s

be most welcome,(728,6)as almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness(1009,6)immediately wrote as
follows:--

“I(160,6)(823,6)thanked you before, my dear(451,7)as I(701,9)(876,6)done,

(135,9)’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style(698,6)still

for his(635,6)

CHAPTER LXI.(34,19)Happy for all(664,6)aternal(391,9) was the day on(836,7)Mrs. Bennet got
rid(535,8)two most deserving daughters. W(558,6)at(337,8)ed pride she
afterwards visited(106,7)(947,6)(648,7)alked of(134,6)Darcy, may be
guessed. I wish I(800,7)say, for(566,6)ak(710,15), that the
accomplishment(749,8)earne(213,6)ire in the estab(43,12)so many of
her children produced so happy an effect as(1012,13)a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman(206,9)res(167,9)life;(860,7), perhaps,
it was luck(495,6)her husband, who(953,6) not have relished domestic
felicity in so unusual a form(319,7)she still was occasionally nervous
and invariably silly.

Mr(591,9)missed his second(575,9) exceedingly; his affectio(269,6)her
drew him oftener(904,6)home than anything else(540,7)do. He(657,11)in
go(933,7)(868,9), especially(1018,6)he(342,6)east expected(205,8)(690,6) and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near

_his_ easy temper, or _her_(324,10)ate heart. The darling(839,6)of his
sister(106,6)then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire;(294,10)and Elizabeth, in addition to every (259,6)source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each(60,6).

Kitty,(342,8)very material advantage, spent the chief(870,8)tim(103,6)

became, by proper attention and management, less irritable(16,6)

balls and young me(424,7)father would never consent(941,8)going.

As for(598,8) and(865,6), their characters suffered no revolutio(433,6)

Elizabeth must now be(722,6)cquainted(724,6)whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown(713,7); and, in spite of
everything,(459,7)t wholl(847,6)out hope(376,6)Darcy might yet be
prevailed on to make his fortune. T(251,6)gratulatory let(820,6)ich(263,11)received(793,6)Lydia o(563,6)(369,9)expl(869,6)(924,7)that, by
his wife at least, if not by himself, such a(212,6)was cherished. The
(154,8)as(599,6)is effect:--

     /* “My dear Lizzy, */(28,7)“I wish you joy. If you love Mr.(322,7)half so well as I do m(84,6)(101,6)(677,7), you(543,6)be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you(173,6)so rich(946,6)when you(36,6)nothing else to do, I(493,6)you will(241,6)think of us. I am sure(840,9)would like a place at court very(310,6)mu(134,8)I do not(88,7)we shall(185,6)quite money enough to live(381,6)upon(665,9)some help.

“Yours,” etc.

As it happened(843,6)(1021,10)had much(67,11), she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief(244,11)as it was i(882,6)po(106,7)afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy(72,8)own private expenses, she
frequently sent them. It had always been eviden(734,6)(1010,7)(968,7)n

their wants, and heedless(316,8)future,(908,14)insuffici(158,6)(70,7)support(884,10)ev(145,6)y changed(172,6) quarters, either Jane or
herself were(877,6)of being applied to for(771,6)little assistance towards
discharging(116,7)bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restor(580,9)peace dismiss(198,6)m to a home, was unsettled i(68,6)extreme. They(210,6)(476,7)moving from(956,7)to(965,7)in quest of a
cheap situation(417,6)(545,7)spending more than(362,6)ought. His aff(519,6)
for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a(348,8)longer; and,
in spite of her youth(566,7)(341,8)(740,6) retained all the claims to
repu(928,7)which(61,7)rriage had given her. Though Darcy could never
receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, h(559,8)ed him
further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when
her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath(812,7)ith the
Bingleys(821,6)both(903,7)m frequently stayed so long, that even(64,8)’s good-humour(195,6)vercome(997,8) proceed(72,6)far as to _talk_
of giv(830,7)m a hint to be gone.

Miss (177,7) was very deeply mortified by(445,6)’s(484,9); but as she
thought it advisable to(577,7) the right of(377,6)ing(495,15)she

astonis(239,6)bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which(523,8)overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge (108,6)had never before fallen in
her way. By(585,10)’s instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties(381,6)her husband,(144,7)a(318,8) will not
